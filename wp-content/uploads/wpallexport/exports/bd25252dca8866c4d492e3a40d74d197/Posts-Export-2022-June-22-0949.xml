		<Title>[:en]ETF’s in GCC: How far have they come?[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) was first introduced in the year 1993 and since then, it has made a long journey and won the interest and participation of many retail and institutional investors. Currently, there are more than 7,000 ETFs traded globally. The global ETF assets were worth about USD 7 trillion as of august 2020 (https://etfgi.com/news/press-releases/2020/09/etfgi-reports-assets-invested-etfs-and-etps-listed-globally-broke). Today ETFs are available in many countries, based on pure equity or a mix of equity and debt or fixed income instruments or alternative asset classes like commodities. ETFs are a powerful tool for investors not only to diversify their portfolios but also to construct customized portfolios that differ in the mix of assets (portfolio allocation) which the investors might think is best for them based on their own perception and assessment of risks and returns of different asset classes or sub-asset classes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">ETFs are passively managed funds that mimic the aggregate market index or any sub-indexes in each stock market or mimic a composite of indexes across several asset classes, all of which being possible with ease in execution and accompanied by low cost or expense ratio. Mutual funds and Fund of Funds (pooled funds invested in other funds) also allow investors to diversify their portfolios. But compared to mutual funds, ETFs provide more standardized building blocks for constructing customized portfolios and that too at a much lower cost compared to MFs. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs are passively managed and the ratio of asset managers cost to total expense is minimal. Standardization in ETFs leads to cost savings. Again, MFs are not traded in the stock exchange while ETFs are actively traded in the stock exchange providing real-time liquidity and price information to the investors that a MF cannot provide. Short trading and Future & Option trading can also be made available for ETFs, unlike MFs. Taking full advantage of ETFs requires investors to not only understand portfolio diversification but also optimal portfolio construction through asset allocation principles.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But why have ETFs not taken off in GCC markets? There are only 7 ETFs domiciled in Saudi Arabia since 2010 and two ETFs domiciled in Qatar launched since 2018. The aggregate ETF fund value domiciled in Saudi is only around USD 566 million while that of Qatar stands at approx. USD 267 million.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Table: ETFs domiciled within GCC region</strong>

<p style="text-align: left;">Interestingly, iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia ETF that was started in 2015 and domiciled in the USA commands a net asset value of USD 775 million. Additionally, Blackrock Fund manager of iShares) has four more funds focused in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and UAE and whose net assets aggregate USD 1,197 million. Invesco, Franklin Templeton and Xtrackers also have GCC country focused ETFs but comparatively their asset sizes are smaller. To capitalize on surging international investor interest following their upgrade into Emerging Market (EM) indices, USA domiciled funds focused in UAE and Qatar was incepted after 2014.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Table: ETFs domiciled outside GCC region</strong>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ETF’s-in-GCC-fig-2.jpg" alt="ETFs domiciled outside GCC region" width="800" height="762" />
<span style="color: #696969; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;">Source: Refinitv</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The number of ETFs based on GCC assets, including those domiciled in the USA are abysmally low. The low asset size of ETFs domiciled in Saudi Arabia compared with ETFs domiciled outside Saudi markets shows the lack of interest for the funds. The awareness about the ETFs and the participation from retail investors are very low compared to other developed and emerging markets.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For the situation to improve, increasing the awareness through investor education and enhanced investor participation in capital markets seem to be the need of the hour. It is disappointing to note that GCC equity markets with a combined market capitalization of USD 2,579 billion have total ETFs of only USD 0.8 billion. No doubt, the 2018 ETFs issuances in Qatar are however encouraging as they show greater investor interest in ETFs and this might signal a turning point for ETFs in the entire GCC.</p>[:]]]></Content>

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]Average crude oil prices have trended upwards for four consecutive months in 2019. The perception of oil risk due to factors like increasing geopolitical tensions triggered by the drone attack on Saudi oil vessels, the end of waivers for US sanctions on Iranian crude exports, unrest in Venezuela and sustained production cuts from OPEC may have all contributed to these higher oil prices. U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that Venezuela’s oil output fell to 830,000 barrels per day (bpd) in April, down 10,000 bpd from March and a 700,000 bpd decline from April 2018. Iranian crude oil production averaged 2.3 million bpd in April, down 300,000 bpd from March.

<strong>Impact of Sanctions on Iran and Venezuela on OPEC production figures (Million Bpd):</strong>

<span style="color: #808080;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-560" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MMR-June-2019-Marmore-Blog-Fig1.jpg" alt="Impact of Sanctions on Iran and Venezuela on OPEC production figures (Million Bpd)" width="625" height="362" /></span>

<span style="color: #808080; font-size: 10px;">Source: EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook May 2019</span>

The future impact of lower supply from Iran and Venezuela is clearly reflected on EIA’s OPEC oil output forecasts, which is expected to average 30.29 million bpd in 2019 and 29.85 million bpd in 2020, down 240,000 bpd and 420,000 bpd, respectively, from its April forecasts.

On the other hand, the trade war between the two largest economies in the world has introduced demand concerns affecting market sentiments contributing to a downward pressure on oil prices. US President Donald Trump raised tariffs on USD 200Bn worth of Chinese commodities from 10% to 25% and China has retaliated with its own tariffs on USD 60Bn US goods as high as 25%, from the original 10%. The trade war has increased fears of a slowdown in global demand for liquid fuels consumption as US and China together accounted for 34% of global oil consumption as of 2018.

Emphasizing more on supply constraints, EIA has forecasted that Brent spot prices will average USD 70 per barrel in 2019 and USD 67 per barrel in 2020, both about USD 5 higher than its April Outlook. It also raised the 2020 WTI price view to USD 63 and Brent view to USD 67 per barrel.

<strong>EIA Oil Price Forecast (USD per barrel):
</strong><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-562" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MMR-June-2019-Marmore-Blog-Fig2.jpg" alt="EIA Oil Price Forecast (USD per barrel):" width="557" height="303" />
<span style="color: #808080; font-size: 10px;">Source: EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook May 2019</span>

Furthermore, EIA predicted, in its short-term energy outlook, that these higher prices would incentivize US to boost production forecasting US oil production to average 12.45 million bpd in 2019 and 13.38 million bpd in 2020, up 150,000 bpd and 350,000 bpd from its April forecasts.  US is expected to become a net exporter of crude oil by the end of 2019.

The trade war has greatly reduced shipments of U.S. crude to China, and it is unlikely that Chinese buyers will sign long-term offtake agreements with U.S. crude exporters as long as trade uncertainties continue (<a style="color: #808080;" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-enterprise-prodt-crude-china/china-not-signing-deals-to-buy-u-s-crude-oil-enterprise-ceo-idUSKCN1SR2BY">Source</a>). In the first half of 2018, China was the third largest importer of U.S. crude, averaging 567 thousand bpd. In the six months ended February, the most recent data available, it has dropped to the fourteenth spot, importing an average of just 129 thousand bpd. US crude oil inventory has been on the rise and if demand from China remains depressed, the market could witness further rise in inventory levels, which might lead to production cuts by the oil companies to keep prices afloat.

Several external factors have also contributed to the volatility in oil prices in the recent past. The contamination in Russia's Druzhba oil pipeline, which boasts a carrying capacity of 1 million bpd, and is a key channel for crude into Eastern Europe and Germany, has hit Russian oil exports. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia halted its main cross-country East-West oil pipeline temporarily after a drone attack damaged pumping stations along the link. The pipeline, which bypasses the Strait of Hormuz, has a capacity to carry 5 million bpd of crude acting as a strategic transporter of oil for the region. A week prior to the attack in Saudi Arabia, UAE’s strategic port of Fujairah witnessed an attack on several oil tankers disrupting trade in the region. Iran has been blamed by Saudi Arabia and UAE for both of these incidents leading to further escalation of political tensions and an upward pressure in oil prices. Oil prices found additional support after tensions escalated when US Maritime Administration reported that US commercial ships including oil tankers sailing through key Middle East waterways could be targeted by Iran, in retaliation of which US sent an aircraft carrier and a bomber taskforce to the region.

With the price of Brent crude hovering in the range of USD 70-75 per barrel in May, Russia might press for a relaxation of the ongoing output restraint in its upcoming OPEC meeting in June. However, with rising US inventories and uncertainty over future demand for oil in the face of the ongoing US-China trade war, Saudi Arabia might extend the deal yet again leading to a potential conflict of interest between the de-facto leaders of the OPEC plus group.

US-China trade war worries are expected to continue to keep a downward pressure on oil prices. EIA expects some tightness in global oil markets during the second and third quarters of 2019, but anticipates that growing production in the United States and key OPEC countries will ensure that global supplies continue to meet demand moving forward. Increased crude oil production in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Russia are likely to backfill the lower Iranian production, though the decision of increasing production will be clear after the OPEC June meeting.

		<Title>[:en]Imagining a Skills Policy for the GCC[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<blockquote><span style="color: #808080;">In order to keep up with the workforce needs of the time, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nations need an interdisciplinary skills policy to mobilize and deploy skills throughout the ecosystem. The skills policy needs to be interdisciplinary in terms of covering requirements, activities, responsibilities and professional tools shared by varied stakeholders, public sector agencies, the private sector, academia and small businesses.</span></blockquote>
<span style="color: #808080;">The challenges of a pragmatic skills policy for the requirements of the GCC can only evolve through several stakeholders collaborating across multiple sectors and public administration layers. Thus, in that sense, the skills policy will effectively be far more than a simple and direct educational policy. The strategy should contain elements of key work trends across GCC societies that constitute important factors for the creation of the policy framework.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">The jobs of today require far greater levels of competence than generally required in the past (Welsh Government, February 2017). To meet the challenge, there is the need for apprenticeships to integrate more widely and effectively into the GCC educational system and its larger economic fabric. This means that stronger co-operation and collaboration between academic and vocational education programs are required to facilitate high quality work or employment opportunities within domestic communities.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">For instance, in many countries in European Union (EU), there are coordinated Vocational Education and Training (VET) systems (Irish Congress of Trade Unions). It has worked credibly well across several parts of the EU economy and the societies that the coordinated approach is the major reason why several countries (like Germany) have historically tackled the phenomenon of NEETS (i.e., young people ‘not in employment education or training’) well (Ibid.). Borrowing from the approach, the GCC should also put into place programs that will ensure that training people for work or jobs that will start coming into existence becomes the norm.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">A starting point would be to have a comprehensive study that identifies emerging skills at multiple levels across educational and skill levels. Different cohorts of workers in the GCC may experience varied levels of under-skilling, with deeper country-specific nuances operational too. Thus, GCC education and training policies should consistently continue to deliver attention to low and middle skilled individuals to offer them required training options. This includes relevant VET courses too. The overwhelming benefit of having such a centralized view of the GCC skills economy is that competing skills initiatives will not vie for similar or the same set of workers.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">Moreover, like in other parts of the world, the variation of under-skilling across sectors needs the potential intervention of informed policy makers (European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training). Essentially, higher levels of under-skilling in highly skills-based or sensitive professions, like health or medicine studies, need education providers to ensure that workers’ skills remain up-to-date while employers too have to remain vigilant to the need of providing greater or continuing vocational training.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">Credible projections of future skills shortages will help in the development of a coherent skills policy and help evaluate training and qualification issues in concert with various international skills experiences and lessons (or insights). Employers should be provided with new and innovative opportunities to ratchet up key skills and critical productivity levels through availing the support of strategic bodies tasked with identifying skills and productivity requirements of major economic sectors. This will galvanize action to prioritize and tackle issues.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">Policy makers will have to strategically support the effective functioning of sector workforce markets by developing occupational standards and continuous learning requirements (or qualifications) for meeting evolving sector needs. The delivery of the designed skills policy should provide the necessary leadership in meeting the minimum functional standards in return for considerable enhancements in sector skills and productivity levels.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">To start with, the GCC should prioritize basic skills as the first rung of the learning pyramid (HM Treasury, U.K.). Basic skills programing into the economic fabric must be viewed or prioritized as the first essential step towards acquiring advanced skills if GCC productivity is to be noticeably improved. A higher skills equilibrium can be made to fruition only by first targeting those with patently low skill levels, as these individuals are most likely to be deleteriously affected by several market failures plaguing the GCC work environment.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">The steady supply of skilled and resourceful workers to GCC firms is important towards cementing success in economic diversification and long-term sustainability initiatives. Dependable skills are a reliable route to a more stable and satisfying employment, better salaries, and long-term sustainable prosperity, which also boost personal development and confidence. The GCC can no longer afford to neglect the skilling and development of its workforce, especially for those who inhabit the lower layers of the skills pyramid.</span>[:]]]></Content>

		<Title>[:en]Use of Drones in GCC: Will disrupt logistics, shipping and e-commerce[:ar]تأثير استخدام طائرات الدرون في منطقة الخليج على قطاعات الإمداد اللوجستي والشحن والتجارة الإلكترونية[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<span style="color: #808080;">The use of drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for commercial purposes has significantly received attention in the recent years. Adoption of drones is powered mainly by factors such as the increasing need for automation in firms, digitization of internal processes, improving the quality and potential of operational efficiency, and cost optimization requirements.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">Apart from adding value to various sectors in the economy with their advanced mechanisms and capabilities, drones are used for short range and light weight applications. One of the most common use of camera installed drones is to capture aerial footage of inaccessible locations. Drones are deployed for studying large sized farmlands, along with monitoring irrigation systems. They provide assistance to farmers in spraying fertilizers, pesticides and water for crops at right times. Further, they are also used for food delivery, 3D mapping and surveillance.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">Drones are subjected to continuous technological advancements to make them robust. They are devised to function in challenging conditions and terrains such as dark and extreme climatic conditions.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;"><strong>Drone-powered solutions for commercial applications</strong></span>

<span style="color: #005596;"><strong>Surveying/Mapping:</strong> Providing accurate and measurable photogrammetric products to provide better understanding to stakeholders about the area examined</span>

<hr />

<span style="color: #005596;"><strong>Asset Supervision and Management:</strong> Providing crucial information about owned assets and performing stock-taking</span>

<hr />

<span style="color: #005596;"><strong>Maintenance monitoring:</strong> Evaluating the status of work in infrastructure or assets that span across vast or remote areas.</span>

<hr />

<span style="color: #005596;"><strong>Transport of Goods:</strong> Delivering light packages especially used by online retailers</span>

<hr />

<span style="color: #005596;"><strong>Surveilance:</strong> Monitoring behavior activities, operation and other information that would facilitate real time decision making</span>

<hr />

<span style="color: #808080; font-size: 10px;">Source: Strategy&/PwC Analysis</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">The consumer drone market is expected to generate revenues of more than $9 billion and exceed 15 million units by 2024.  It is expected that by 2020, the retail consumer drone market will grow to around US$3.3 billion. The drone industry will have $8 billion to $10 billion worth economic impact worldwide, as well as creating 100,000 jobs globally (Global Market Insights, Inc.).</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">The market for drones in GCC is projected to reach US$1.5 billion by 2022 (Strategy&). Inspections and surveying will be the most widely used applications along with aerial filming and photography. Drone usage will be incorporated across all stages of projects in the construction sector, in order to achieve a competitive edge and speed up the construction process. Emergency services such as medical deliveries, farming, logistics and cartography applications will be the leading drone use cases in the Middle East.</span>
<span style="color: #808080;"> </span><strong><span style="color: #808080;">Drone-powered solutions high-level market size in the GCC (US$ millions, 2022)</span> </strong>
<img class="size-full wp-image-578 aligncenter" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Use-of-Drones-in-GCC-Marmore-blog-fig2.jpg" alt="Drone-powered solutions high-level market size in the GCC (US$ millions, 2022) " width="642" height="378" /><span style="color: #808080; font-size: 10px;">Source: Strategy&</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">Regionally, UAE government will lead the drone technology development and adoption. In the UAE, various drone applications are piloted especially for traffic monitoring, surveillance, oil spills searches, water and power asset monitoring, litter monitoring, landfill density optimization and police patrols. 70% of the demand for drone technologies will arise from public sector, with an overall increase in the drone flights regionally by at least 150% and the number of drone technology users tripling over the course of 2019 (Zawya). This is expected to increase the demand for Drone-as-a-Service providers, software manufacturers offering data evaluation solutions and hardware vendors in 2019. Drone-mounted sensors are deployed to capture extensive data, leading towards increased digitalization of industrial processes.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">Drones were used in mapping the Jebel Jais Flight project, which is the world’s longest zip line measuring at 2.83 kilometers in the mountain region of Jebel Jais. The zip line corridor span from the highest point of approximately 1,600 m to the lower point of 850 m. The deepest of the gully is around 750 m. Drones and structure from motion (SFM) photogrammetry were used to obtain the data from the most inaccessible part of the mountain. In the case of Jabel Jais, drone technology enabled mapping to be delivered in a record time that would otherwise take up to 4-5 times longer if ground surveying was conducted, which was virtually impossible in this project. Drones have significant advantage in terms of precision, convenience and cost in comparison to traditional means like helicopters or satellites. Drones facilitate accurate modelling and mapping, at a cost much lesser than satellites or rental helicopters. As they fly much closer, they are able to obtain resolution of a few centimeters and capture images at unprecedented oblique angles. Drones can fly in a matter of hours, making it possible to react quickly to sudden events. For farmers wanting to assess crop damage or oil companies investigating a drop in a pipeline, the economic benefit of receiving information quickly can overcome the acquisition costs.</span>
<blockquote><span style="color: #808080;">Drones are expected to disrupt the logistics, shipping and e-commerce industries. The case of Dubai based Eniverse Technologies to introduce home delivery in the UAE market is an option for many firms to replace the conventional road-based delivery model. These drones will enable the shipment of goods and products weighing 5kg or less to locations across Dubai.</span></blockquote>
<span style="color: #808080;">The successful utilization and application of drones depend upon a number of underlying support factors such as sensors, cameras, Global Positioning System (GPS), coordination with sectors like telecom and aviation etc., robust regulatory framework, and investor interest. The safe operation of drones and data collection using them is only a small part of the process. What can be done with the data, how fast it can be processed, and developing the use cases for the data that is collected require assistance from a wide range of technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and 5G.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">Although drones have huge commercial value, the technology is prone to multiple cases of misuse including disruption of airspace, use in warfare, threat in high security regions etc. Therefore, drones are banned in various Middle Eastern countries like Algeria, Kuwait, Iran and Syria. GCC countries have strict restrictions with respect to using drones. Oman allows licenses for drones only for commercial purposes whereas in Saudi Arabia, those who own drones or wish to purchase and use it within the country should receive permit from the General Authority for Civil Aviation (GACA).</span>[:ar]<span style="color: #808080;">The use of drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for commercial purposes has significantly received attention in the recent years. Adoption of drones is powered mainly by factors such as the increasing need for automation in firms, digitization of internal processes, improving the quality and potential of operational efficiency, and cost optimization requirements.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">Apart from adding value to various sectors in the economy with their advanced mechanisms and capabilities, drones are used for short range and light weight applications. One of the most common use of camera installed drones is to capture aerial footage of inaccessible locations. Drones are deployed for studying large sized farmlands, along with monitoring irrigation systems. They provide assistance to farmers in spraying fertilizers, pesticides and water for crops at right times. Further, they are also used for food delivery, 3D mapping and surveillance.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">Drones are subjected to continuous technological advancements to make them robust. They are devised to function in challenging conditions and terrains such as dark and extreme climatic conditions.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">The consumer drone market is expected to generate revenues of more than $9 billion and exceed 15 million units by 2024.  It is expected that by 2020, the retail consumer drone market will grow to around US$3.3 billion. The drone industry will have $8 billion to $10 billion worth economic impact worldwide, as well as creating 100,000 jobs globally (Global Market Insights, Inc.).</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">The market for drones in GCC is projected to reach US$1.5 billion by 2022 (Strategy&amp;). Inspections and surveying will be the most widely used applications along with aerial filming and photography. Drone usage will be incorporated across all stages of projects in the construction sector, in order to achieve a competitive edge and speed up the construction process. Emergency services such as medical deliveries, farming, logistics and cartography applications will be the leading drone use cases in the Middle East.</span>
<span style="color: #808080;"> </span><strong><span style="color: #808080;">Drone-powered solutions high-level market size in the GCC (US$ millions, 2022)</span> </strong>

<span style="color: #808080;">Regionally, UAE government will lead the drone technology development and adoption. In the UAE, various drone applications are piloted especially for traffic monitoring, surveillance, oil spills searches, water and power asset monitoring, litter monitoring, landfill density optimization and police patrols. 70% of the demand for drone technologies will arise from public sector, with an overall increase in the drone flights regionally by at least 150% and the number of drone technology users tripling over the course of 2019 (Zawya). This is expected to increase the demand for Drone-as-a-Service providers, software manufacturers offering data evaluation solutions and hardware vendors in 2019. Drone-mounted sensors are deployed to capture extensive data, leading towards increased digitalization of industrial processes.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">Drones were used in mapping the Jebel Jais Flight project, which is the world’s longest zip line measuring at 2.83 kilometers in the mountain region of Jebel Jais. The zip line corridor span from the highest point of approximately 1,600 m to the lower point of 850 m. The deepest of the gully is around 750 m. Drones and structure from motion (SFM) photogrammetry were used to obtain the data from the most inaccessible part of the mountain. In the case of Jabel Jais, drone technology enabled mapping to be delivered in a record time that would otherwise take up to 4-5 times longer if ground surveying was conducted, which was virtually impossible in this project. Drones have significant advantage in terms of precision, convenience and cost in comparison to traditional means like helicopters or satellites. Drones facilitate accurate modelling and mapping, at a cost much lesser than satellites or rental helicopters. As they fly much closer, they are able to obtain resolution of a few centimeters and capture images at unprecedented oblique angles. Drones can fly in a matter of hours, making it possible to react quickly to sudden events. For farmers wanting to assess crop damage or oil companies investigating a drop in a pipeline, the economic benefit of receiving information quickly can overcome the acquisition costs.</span>
<blockquote><span style="color: #808080;">Drones are expected to disrupt the logistics, shipping and e-commerce industries. The case of Dubai based Eniverse Technologies to introduce home delivery in the UAE market is an option for many firms to replace the conventional road-based delivery model. These drones will enable the shipment of goods and products weighing 5kg or less to locations across Dubai.</span></blockquote>
<span style="color: #808080;">The successful utilization and application of drones depend upon a number of underlying support factors such as sensors, cameras, Global Positioning System (GPS), coordination with sectors like telecom and aviation etc., robust regulatory framework, and investor interest. The safe operation of drones and data collection using them is only a small part of the process. What can be done with the data, how fast it can be processed, and developing the use cases for the data that is collected require assistance from a wide range of technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and 5G.</span>

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<span style="color: #808080;">Rise in automation is changing the ways of doing business. Similar to the digital and technological revolution, big business houses have been the first to adopt automation across their activities in the form of driverless cars, robot assistants, and delivery drones etc. For example, the Dubai Metro is already driverless, and the UAE is pioneering the Dubai Autonomous Transportation Strategy aiming to make 25 per cent of all trips autonomous by 2030. With progress in automation, the costs of sensors and artificial intelligence are decreasing making automation more economically viable.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">All of this has great relevance for the SMEs as they can equally well exploit the benefits from automation. In <b>SMEs automation</b> has potential both in manufacturing, services and business processes. Consulting firm TechSci Research reported that the GCC market for industrial and building automation will reach $10.3 billion in 2023, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.7% compared to only $5.6 billion in 2017. Increasingly across the Middle East, automation is becoming more relevant, especially as manufacturers seek to increase productivity and safety whilst the consumer demands higher quality and better value for money.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">Industrial automation has been around for some time, but in recent years, business process automation is progressing rapidly. Business automation ensures that the multiple processes in business, that were once scattered, no longer operate in silos. Procurement, sales, operations, and payments are integrated, giving rise to a more clear and real time view of the business.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;"><strong>SMEs- Definition and Global Picture </strong></span>
<span style="color: #808080;">Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) are emerging as the backbone of modern economies.</span>
<img class="size-full wp-image-588 aligncenter" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Automation_in_SMEs-MarmoreBlog-fig1.jpg" alt="SMEs- Definition and Global Picture " width="570" height="378" />

<span style="color: #808080; font-size: 10px;">Source: OECD</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">In terms of contribution to GDP, the role of SMEs is the greatest in Brazil at 61%, China at 60%, and United States at 50 percent and the EU average at 55 percent.  Automation is spanning across business models and industries, and is no more limited to the big businesses.  Small businesses are leading in automation with 18 percent having already automated parts of their business compared to 15 percent of mid-size firms (smallbusiness.co.uk).   Both the developed countries and the Newly Industrialized Economies (NIEs) such as Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore are leading in automation especially in factories. According to a World Economic Forum estimate of 2016, an estimated 1.6 million manufacturing and production jobs will be replaced between 2015 and 2020.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">SMEs in the GCC have a key role in contributing towards economic growth and employment creation. According to the 2017 estimates by the Ministry of Economy, SMEs account for 94 per cent of companies operating in UAE, and provide jobs for more than 86 per cent of the private sector workforce. It is reported that a study by MENA Research Partners, a leading research company in the region suggests that GCC’s SME sector presents a potential of $920 billion with 156% growth expected in the next five years, employing 22 million people. Further, GCC region currently accounts for 34% of the MENA SME sector, around $360 billion per year (26% of their GDP).</span>

<span style="color: #808080;"><strong>How is automation used in firms currently?</strong></span>
<span style="color: #808080;">Dominos developed its Robotic Unit that is an automated delivery system which provides the facility to keep the pizzas hot and the drinks cold. Starship Technologies which partners with Mercedes-Benz Vans use automated bots to deliver food products and other merchandise. Automation is increasingly used in medical field. STAR, a medical service robot, performed an experimental surgery with better accuracy than its human counterparts. Bio-printing creates functioning human organs using a combination of human cells and 3D printing materials. In the real estate sector, automation is employed in activities ranging from supplying contractors, staffing companies, real estate buyers and agents. Customer service has disruption in the form of automated phone service and online digital assistants. Robots are assisting customers in stores to select products and access services.</span>

</table>
<span style="color: #808080;"><strong>Potential Areas where automation can be adopted in SMEs</strong></span>
<span style="color: #808080;">Automation essentially takes an input, runs it automatically and repeatedly through a set of predetermined commands and returns the results. This makes the automated process scalable and more efficient. Automation ensures that the processes are carried out effectively and the time and resources of the business is spent on networking, building relationships and brainstorming ideas. Some areas which can be directly impacted by automation are as follows:</span>

<span style="color: #808080;"><strong> - Automation in finance:</strong> Cloud based solutions provide SMEs the facility to adopt automated procedures such as electronic invoicing, employee self-service management and online procurement. The human intervention and the possibility of errors in manual processing is reduced substantially, leading to streamlining of the process and better financial management. Also an increasing number of new solutions are allowing companies to establish end-to-end payments value chain with their suppliers and customers. These new solutions enable ubiquitous anytime anywhere, immediate and omni-channel payments. They will be fully integrated into the financial accounting systems of the enterprises. All parties, such as ecommerce platforms, banks, fintech companies and their partners, will eventually profit from open API standards which will be used for creating new services and enable seamless, fully-automated processing of payments and financial transactions.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;"><strong>- Automation in HR:</strong> the performance and commitment of the employees in SMEs are crucial as they have the first hand responsibility to develop and deliver the product or service. Further, SMEs are characterized by minimum number of employees (250 or less). Therefore, recruiting the right employees and assessing their performance is critical in the SMEs. In case there arises a need for evaluation or further training, an automated process is better capable to identify and address it. The most important benefit of automation in HR is that the managers are able to track the overall performance and monitor features like the KPIs.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;"><strong>- Automation in marketing:</strong> Marketing automation software includes tools that enable targeted content and email marketing, SEO, and CRM. It ensures that the content is relevant and the emails are more targeted in nature. It also automatically updates the contact lists, ensuring that communication is effective and timely.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;"><strong>Current-task automation potential for selected occupations

<span style="color: #808080;"><strong>Challenges in automation in SMEs</strong></span>
<span style="color: #808080;">SMEs have specific challenges around processes that are required to be tackled on a regular basis such as time slicing, scalability and skill sets. It is not necessary and feasible to automate everything in an SME from the first day. Its needs keep evolving as the business develops and activities expand. Therefore, an SME will require a technology that is capable of withstanding regular change and updates as the business grows. A small business features quick transactions and exchanges, therefore there is a need for technology that is fast to operate. They require technology that need the minimum support, time and investment to get restored in case of a breakdown.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;"><strong>Conclusions and Recommendations </strong></span>
<span style="color: #808080;">The business and operational models of current generation SMEs are inherently different from the traditional businesses. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) traverse through several phases in their life cycles—start-up, growth, maturity, and renewal/rebirth or decline—and their business needs vary depending on those phases. Small businesses should adopt intelligent automation to be ahead in the competition. However, there are challenges that need to be overcome for effective implementation of automation:</span>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #003366;"><em>- Automation requires intelligent and robust programing and networks should be made secure.</em></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #003366;"><em>- Firms using it need reliable data disciplines.</em></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #003366;"><em>- SMEs may find it difficult to establish the initial infrastructure, applications, compliance and data security and other critical enablers that ensure speed and quality in automation.</em></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #003366;"><em>- Automation technologies are simple and intuitive, thereby causing the business teams to automate by themselves. This can lead to proliferation and increase in the future costs of the firm.</em></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="color: #808080;">To conclude, SMEs will need to grasp the opportunities that technology brings with it and the change it can make to traditional ways of working to stay competitive. The advantage of this is that business administration can become simplified and this will empower entrepreneurs to stay focused on building their businesses and driving growth and leave routine administrative tasks to technology.</span></blockquote>[:]]]></Content>

		<Title>[:en]Combining technology with Brick and Mortar stores in the GCC: 6 ideas[:ar]تبني التكنولوجيا في المتاجر التقليدية بالأسواق الخليجية: 6 أفكار[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<span style="color: #808080;">Euromonitor International projects that the retail sales across Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia and UAE will increase by more than USD 24 billion over the next five years. The UAE retail industry currently (worth USD 55 billion) will lead the trend reaching to USD 63.8 billion by 2023, at an estimated growth rate of 16%. Non-store modes of retailing such as online shopping, direct selling, social media and home shopping is estimated to grow by 78 percent from 2018 to 2023.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">However, global picture is slightly different. In 2017, closing of about 7000 retail shops were announced and bankruptcy in the sector increased by 30% as compared to 2016. Customer expectations for brick and mortar store experiences are changing rapidly. Forrester estimates that 53% of all purchase decisions are digitally influenced.  With the widespread growth of e-commerce websites and applications, the shoppers expect customers services like detailed product information in store, read ratings and reviews and access the best available price.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">Sales at supermarket and hypermarket outlets in the GCC region are estimated to reach USD 70.1 billion by 2021, growing at a CAGR of 4.3%. This indicates that there will be an increase in the establishment of regional as well as international players, especially in Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">Retail space in GCC is continuously expanding and diversifying in response to the changing demographic patterns and increasing tourism activity. Shopping malls are developed with the intent of providing customers with the experience of shopping, dining and entertainment. Multipurpose malls in the region like Dubai Mall, Mall of Emirates, Kuwait Marina Mall etc. have transformed shopping into a lifestyle.</span>
<blockquote><span style="color: #808080;">Customers have high expectations of what the store looks like and how their shopping experience should be.</span></blockquote>
<span style="color: #808080;">Below are some technology that brick and mortar stores in the GCC can adopt for a better and efficient retail shopping experience:</span>

<span style="color: #808080;"><strong>1. Connected Inventory Management</strong></span>
<span style="color: #808080;">Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain and RFID sensors can replace manual shelf monitoring and restocking, thus eliminating the issue of ‘out of stock’ which is persistent in retail outlets. Inventory robots are used by retailers like Amazon to automate to check the stock and automate re-ordering.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;"><strong>2. Personalized Recommendations</strong></span>
<span style="color: #808080;">E-commerce sites offer the feature of providing recommendations of products that are similar or complementary to the one selected. However, in the brick and mortar stores, the customer relies on the sales person or personal observation to get similar products or see the available options.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">In a brick and mortar store, this can be made possible through interactive displays than recognize the selected product, provide options and display alternatives or products that complements it. Supermarkets in Europe uses motion sensors that displays the product information.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">The Apple Store in the Mall of the Emirates provides customers an immersive and engaging shopping experience whereby they gain a complete understanding of the technology that is offered instead of feeling pressured to purchase the product.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;"><strong>3. Smart Trial Rooms</strong></span>
<span style="color: #808080;">In case of textile stores, the crowd especially at trial rooms can be de-motivating to continue with the shopping. Smart trial rooms are interactive in nature and assist customers throughout product selection by providing recommendations, apart from helping them trying on clothes without going back to the shopping floor.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">The Marks and Spencer’s stores in Middle East have launched the virtual Closet, which uses augmented reality for customers to try the outfits and accessories before purchase.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;"><strong>4. Self-Checkout Options</strong></span>
<span style="color: #808080;">Customers at physical retails often face the challenge of long queues at the billing counter as opposed to easy checkout and payment, discounted fares through coupon application in e-commerce sites. This can be tackled by providing self-checkout solutions at the store which gives the customer the power to be in charge of the entire shopping process.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">Mikropis based in South Korea is aiming to install self-checkouts in retail outlets by collaborating with IBM and Toshiba. Although it is currently present across South Korea and China, it is planning expansion into other Asian and Middle Eastern regions.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;"><strong>5. Store Optimization</strong></span>
<span style="color: #808080;">IoT based technology can provide the executives and employees with data and analytics of the store which would provide insights into customer behavior, product movement and purchase trends that can be used to improve store efficiency and shopping experience.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;"><strong>6. Micro Trips</strong></span>
<span style="color: #808080;">Brick and Mortar stores especially grocery stores are encouraging their customers to undertake micro trips, in which they can order online and pick up in person with the entire time spent at the store being less than five minutes.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;"> </span><span style="color: #808080;">In order to adapt to the evolving retail space and customer requirements, players in the retail sector should develop an omnichannel approach where they establish a strong online presence, robust and multiple payment mechanisms, and an efficient distribution and logistics network. Customer experience is the priority for any service provider, and same is the case with brick and mortar stores. They should be able to offer the ease and convenience that online retailers successfully provide within the physical infrastructure of the retail store.</span>[:ar]<span style="color: #808080;">Euromonitor International projects that the retail sales across Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia and UAE will increase by more than USD 24 billion over the next five years. The UAE retail industry currently (worth USD 55 billion) will lead the trend reaching to USD 63.8 billion by 2023, at an estimated growth rate of 16%. Non-store modes of retailing such as online shopping, direct selling, social media and home shopping is estimated to grow by 78 percent from 2018 to 2023.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">However, global picture is slightly different. In 2017, closing of about 7000 retail shops were announced and bankruptcy in the sector increased by 30% as compared to 2016. Customer expectations for brick and mortar store experiences are changing rapidly. Forrester estimates that 53% of all purchase decisions are digitally influenced.  With the widespread growth of e-commerce websites and applications, the shoppers expect customers services like detailed product information in store, read ratings and reviews and access the best available price.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">Sales at supermarket and hypermarket outlets in the GCC region are estimated to reach USD 70.1 billion by 2021, growing at a CAGR of 4.3%. This indicates that there will be an increase in the establishment of regional as well as international players, especially in Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">Retail space in GCC is continuously expanding and diversifying in response to the changing demographic patterns and increasing tourism activity. Shopping malls are developed with the intent of providing customers with the experience of shopping, dining and entertainment. Multipurpose malls in the region like Dubai Mall, Mall of Emirates, Kuwait Marina Mall etc. have transformed shopping into a lifestyle.</span>
<blockquote><span style="color: #808080;">Customers have high expectations of what the store looks like and how their shopping experience should be.</span></blockquote>
<span style="color: #808080;">Below are some technology that brick and mortar stores in the GCC can adopt for a better and efficient retail shopping experience:</span>

<span style="color: #808080;"><strong>1. Connected Inventory Management</strong></span>
<span style="color: #808080;">Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain and RFID sensors can replace manual shelf monitoring and restocking, thus eliminating the issue of ‘out of stock’ which is persistent in retail outlets. Inventory robots are used by retailers like Amazon to automate to check the stock and automate re-ordering.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;"><strong>2. Personalized Recommendations</strong></span>
<span style="color: #808080;">E-commerce sites offer the feature of providing recommendations of products that are similar or complementary to the one selected. However, in the brick and mortar stores, the customer relies on the sales person or personal observation to get similar products or see the available options.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">In a brick and mortar store, this can be made possible through interactive displays than recognize the selected product, provide options and display alternatives or products that complements it. Supermarkets in Europe uses motion sensors that displays the product information.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">The Apple Store in the Mall of the Emirates provides customers an immersive and engaging shopping experience whereby they gain a complete understanding of the technology that is offered instead of feeling pressured to purchase the product.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;"><strong>3. Smart Trial Rooms</strong></span>
<span style="color: #808080;">In case of textile stores, the crowd especially at trial rooms can be de-motivating to continue with the shopping. Smart trial rooms are interactive in nature and assist customers throughout product selection by providing recommendations, apart from helping them trying on clothes without going back to the shopping floor.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">The Marks and Spencer’s stores in Middle East have launched the virtual Closet, which uses augmented reality for customers to try the outfits and accessories before purchase.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;"><strong>4. Self-Checkout Options</strong></span>
<span style="color: #808080;">Customers at physical retails often face the challenge of long queues at the billing counter as opposed to easy checkout and payment, discounted fares through coupon application in e-commerce sites. This can be tackled by providing self-checkout solutions at the store which gives the customer the power to be in charge of the entire shopping process.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">Mikropis based in South Korea is aiming to install self-checkouts in retail outlets by collaborating with IBM and Toshiba. Although it is currently present across South Korea and China, it is planning expansion into other Asian and Middle Eastern regions.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;"><strong>5. Store Optimization</strong></span>
<span style="color: #808080;">IoT based technology can provide the executives and employees with data and analytics of the store which would provide insights into customer behavior, product movement and purchase trends that can be used to improve store efficiency and shopping experience.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;"><strong>6. Micro Trips</strong></span>
<span style="color: #808080;">Brick and Mortar stores especially grocery stores are encouraging their customers to undertake micro trips, in which they can order online and pick up in person with the entire time spent at the store being less than five minutes.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;"> </span><span style="color: #808080;">In order to adapt to the evolving retail space and customer requirements, players in the retail sector should develop an omnichannel approach where they establish a strong online presence, robust and multiple payment mechanisms, and an efficient distribution and logistics network. Customer experience is the priority for any service provider, and same is the case with brick and mortar stores. They should be able to offer the ease and convenience that online retailers successfully provide within the physical infrastructure of the retail store.</span>[:]]]></Content>

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<span style="color: #808080;">Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco) raised USD 12 Billion with the help of its first ever-international bond issuance in the month of April. Aramco marketed a U.S. dollar-denominated debt issue split into five tranches with maturities ranging from three to thirty years. The bond received overwhelming demand from investors, as the company recorded orders of over USD 100 Billion. Demand for the bond was the largest ever recorded for any emerging market bond, surpassing order book value of more than USD 52 Billion for Qatar’s $12 billion deal in 2018, USD 67 Billion for Saudi Arabia’s first international sovereign bond offer in 2016 and USD 69 Billion orders for Argentina’s USD 16.5 Billion sovereign bond in 2016 (<a style="color: #808080;" href="https://in.reuters.com/article/us-aramco-bond-demand/aramco-sets-record-with-100-billion-demand-for-landmark-bond-idINKCN1RL0NF">Reuters</a>).</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">It displayed a significant vote of confidence from market participants, as the company was able to issue their bonds at a final price that was lower than that of Saudi Arabia’ sovereign bond yields. Not only that, but the yield provided by the company at the time of issuance was 20bps lower across all maturities than what had been initially intended.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">Kuwait Blue Chip Companies – Banks Outperform on Regulatory Reforms. Kuwait’s GDP growth returned to positive territory in 2018, with higher input from its non-oil sectors, increased government investment to boost growth and improvement in the oil prices. Reforms to the capital markets and banking sectors attracted further inflows into the economy. The year 2018 has been an eventful one for Kuwait capital markets with the opening up of the banking industry being the latest in a series of measures aimed at encouraging investment in the financial sector (for more detailed coverage on GCC capital market read Monthly market review). Furthermore, we saw the reclassification of Boursa Kuwait’s indices into three groupings to improve market transparency and liquidity.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;"> </span><span style="color: #808080;">Out of the top 10 blue chips, seven of them belong to the banking industry all of which have registered a double-digit growth in net profit for the year 2018. To further support efforts to diversify the economy away from a dependence on hydrocarbons, the government has also sought to encourage foreign investment in the banking sector. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry announced changes that now allow foreign investors to acquire up to 5% of the capital of a Kuwaiti bank, with stakeholders looking to increase participation above this threshold to require authorization from the Central Bank of Kuwait. The ceiling on overall foreign ownership in any single lender has been set at 49% (Zawya- <a style="color: #808080;" href="https://www.zawya.com/mena/en/economy/story/Kuwait_Year_in_Review_2018-ZAWYA20190128040533/">Kuwait_Year_in_Review_2018</a>). Moreover, the Central Bank of Kuwait has taken steps to improve the credit conditions in the market by improving regulatory reforms in granting loans and personal financing for consumer and housing purposes and issuance of credit cards to induce individuals to increase their borrowing. This on the face of stricter regulations for borrowing for speculative activities will lead to the prudent use of credit and improve banking fundamentals.  </span>

<span style="color: #808080;"> </span><span style="color: #808080;"><strong>National Bank of Kuwait</strong>, recorded a 14.5% YoY increase in net profit for full-year 2018, to reach a record USD 1.2Bn. Increased spending on infrastructure in the Arabian Gulf, higher income from Islamic financing, and a rise in fees and commissions drove company performance. Net Interest Income increased by 9.3% YoY to USD 2.3Bn in 2018 compared to 2017, driven by growth in financing activities, growth in income from fees and commissions and effective cost management policies and NPL ratio fell 1.42% to 1.38% over the same period. For Q1 2019, the net income increased 13.3% to USD 354Mn helped by higher interest income and lower provisioning charges. Interest income increased by 18% and provisions increased 26% in Q1 2019, compared to the same period last year.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;"> </span><span style="color: #808080;"><strong>Kuwait Finance House's</strong> net profit amounted to USD 750Mn for the full year 2018, up 22.9% from USD 610Mn in 2017. The bank attributed the increase in net profit to an increase of 11.1% in net operating income to USD 1.49Bn for 2018. Net Interest Income increased by 18% YoY to USD 1.74Bn in 2018. KFH reported net profit of USD 170Mn for Q1 of 2019 compared to USD 147Mn for the same period last year, an increase of 15.5%. Total finance income for the first quarter of the year reached USD 751Mn, a growth of 9.5% compared to the same period last year. Total operating income for the first quarter of the year reached USD 647Mn, a growth increase by 4.1% compared to the same period last year. KFH and Ahli United Bank of Bahrain have been conducting merger talks since mid-2018 and finally concluded the merger agreement details on Jan 2019. The merger is expected to boost the consolidated profits of KFH as the merged entity will create the largest bank in Kuwait and the sixth largest bank in the Gulf region. The merger is expected to increase the Bank’s lending capacity by over 60% after acquisition, which will enhance its ability to finance large projects locally and regionally through reducing costs, and allowing it to tap new markets such as Egypt and the United Kingdom (Aawsat - <a style="color: #808080;" href="https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/1564121/kuwait-finance-house-bahrain%E2%80%99s-ahli-united-bank-merger-underway">kuwait-finance-house-bahrain-ahli-united-bank-merger-underway</a>).</span>

<span style="color: #808080;"><strong>Mobile telecommunication Company (Zain</strong> <strong>Kuwait)</strong> 2018 net profit increased by 23% to reach USD 649Mn. Maintaining its market leadership, Zain Group saw its customer base grow from 46.6Mn in 2017 to 48.9Mn in 2018. Zain group capital expenditure increased 59.6% in 2018 to reach USD 747Mn as the company invested in network expansion and 4G / 5G upgrades including fibre rollout and spectrum fees in several key markets. This supported the growth of Group data revenues which experienced a 71% growth for the full-year 2018, representing 33% of the Group’s total revenues. In its 5G roadmap, Zain launched BEAM, the advanced wireless broadband technology, offering speeds that match fiber optics at 40 Mbps, and was the first telco to offer this technology in Kuwait. Zain Kuwait remains the most profitable company in the Group, as it continues to maintain its market lead (37% market share) in both value share and customers. The year 2018 was a challenging one for Zain Kuwait, as it witnessed intense price competition in the market and subscriber numbers dropped to 2.6 million in 2018 from 2.7 million from a year ago. However, the operation managed to maintain its revenue at USD 1.1Bn for the year and Average Revenue per User (ARPU) increased from USD 24 in 2017 to USD 26 in 2018.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;"><strong>Boubyan Bank</strong> reported a net profit of USD 185Mn in 2018, a growth rate of 17.3% compared to 2017. For Q1 2019, the net income increased 14.5% to USD 48Mn compared to the same period last year. Most of the main indicators witnessed a significant growth with total assets increasing to USD 14.33Bn at a growth rate of 9% while the interest income increased to register USD 160Mn at a growth rate of 14% in addition to the increase in customers’ deposits by 7%, amounting to USD 12.5Bn. The performance and growth is seen as a continued realization of the Bank’s 2020 strategy, as they scale up their core business by focusing on affluent and high net worth clients and to be the primary banker for large and mid-market corporates.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;"><strong>Agility Public Warehousing Company</strong> reported 2018 net profit of USD 268Mn, an increase of 17.9% from 2017. Agility revenue grew 9.7% to USD 5.1Bn in 2018, driven by growth across core products. Agility has improved profitability for 10 consecutive quarters posting double-digit EBITDA growth for the third year in a row. The company continues its investment with the aim of building over than 1 million sqm of new warehousing and industrial facilities across the Middle East and Africa. Cash flow from operations has been healthy and growing, while free cash flow has been limited as a result of higher capital expenditure that led to increased borrowing to fund investments (Agility - agility-reports-earnings-increases-of-18-percent-for-2018)</span>

		<Title>[:en]Saudi Arabia’s move towards a cash less economy propelled by COVID-19[:ar]Saudi Arabia’s move towards a cash less economy propelled by COVID-19[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]The past decade has witnessed a large amount of technological disruption that has changed the way we interact with the world. The payments universe is not averse to this disruption, with the usage of cash diminishing by the day. The world has begun the transition towards a more cashless society, with mobile devices, digital wallets and other forms of payments gaining preference among users. A cashless society is one where all the financial transactions take place through transfer of digital information instead of physical bank notes or coins. This transition has reached a substantial stage already in developed markets, but several emerging and low-income markets remain underpenetrated. Saudi Arabia remains at a much better position compared to other emerging markets. The journey of Saudi Arabia has gained momentum in the past three years with a strong push from the regulatory side. As the world gets accustomed to the realities of COVID-19 outbreak, it seems that the push towards a more cashless society just got much stronger.

The outbreak of COVID-19 prompted Saudi government to take stringent lockdown measures to contain the spread of the disease. These measures have led to stalling of economic activity, which has resulted in lower consumer spending during the period. Due to lockdown restrictions, cash withdrawals and point of sale (POS) transactions in the months of April have taken a dip compared to last year. However, with every crisis comes a silver lining. In the case of<a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/gcc-coronavirus-dashboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> COVID-19</a>, social distancing efforts are expected to create a temporary aversion towards making cash or contact payments, which would in turn be favourable for contactless forms of payments.

Saudi Arabia has taking huge strides in its transition towards a cashless society in recent years, supported by initiatives taken by the Government and the Central Bank. Regulations laid by the government that mandates employers to assign wages to their employees to their bank account has been a major step that has increased access to electronic modes of transaction to a large portion of Saudi Arabia’s population. Additionally, the initiatives taken to migrate payments during the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages towards cashless forms could become a significant step that would, can be expected to shift substantial share of consumer payments away from cash in the coming years. The Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) introduced its own payment infrastructure in 2018, which aims to ensure the interoperability and standardisation of payment systems for both banks and fintech firms. It was followed by the establishment of a regulatory sandbox, which helps upcoming fintech companies and banks to develop, test and scale up payment technologies in a controlled environment. These initiatives have led to substantial improvement in moving towards cashless modes of payment.

<strong>POS transaction to cash withdrawal ratio in Saudi Arabia (by value)</strong>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4792" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/POS-transaction-to-cash-withdrawal-ratio-in-Saudi-Arabia-by-value.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="762" />
<span style="color: #696969; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;">Source: SAMA</span>

Usage of cash has been reducing drastically as more and more people have started using cashless modes of transaction. In March 2020, the number of POS transactions that took place in Saudi Arabia has increased by 44% compared to the same month in the previous year. Banks have also taken steps to increase the number of POS devices in circulation. Total number of POS devices grew by 28% in March 2020 on a year on year basis.

Considering the amount of ATM withdrawals as a proxy for cash spending and the amount of POS transactions as the proxy for cashless payments, the spending preferences in Saudi Arabia show a growing preference towards cashless payments. The ratio of POS transactions to ATM withdrawals has been improving over the years and stood at March 2019 at 36%. The same ratio for the month of March 2020 stood at 44%, indicating a shift towards more POS transactions. The ratio is expected to go up further as COVID-19 will only accelerate the transition towards contactless payments in the country. As per Saudi Vision 2030, the country aimed to increase the share of cashless payments to 28% by 2020 and to 70% by 2030. Saudi Arabia has thereby surpassed its objective for 2020 and looks on course to achieving its objectives for 2030.

<strong>Share of NFC in total POS transactions in Saudi Arabia</strong>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4792" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Share-of-NFC-in-total-POS-transactions-in-Saudi-Arabia.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="762" />
<span style="color: #696969; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;">Source: SAMA</span>

The usage of Near Field Communication (NFC) has also seen a sharp uptick in the past year. Customers are more comfortable in making contactless payments through NFC, that is enabled in their cards and mobiles. For instance, the total number of transactions that took place through mobiles and cards stood at 3% and 37% of total POS transactions respectively in March 2019. However, in a span of one year, the ratio shot up to 17% and 65% respectively. Contactless payments through NFC technology now account for approximately 85% of the total POS transactions in the country.

Saudi Arabia remains relatively well placed in the region to tackle the need for cashless payment infrastructure during times of lockdown due to its earlier initiatives. In the wake of COVID-19 outbreak, SAMA took additional measures pertinent to cashless transactions. The monthly transfer limit for e-wallets was raised from SAR 10,000 to SAR 20,000 to encourage consumers to use e-wallets to make payments. Non-bank financial institution digital wallet licenses have been issued to STCPay, HalalaH and BayanPay during 2020, with the latter two wallets spending successful time in SAMA’s sandbox. These measures would help the growth of digital wallets, which is a key form of contactless payment used worldwide. Other measures taken by SAMA during COVID-19 outbreak include the exemption of fees associated with interbank money transfer using Saudi Arabian Royal Interbank Express System and raising the limit of contactless bank card payments in POS terminals from SAR 100 to SAR 300.

Adoption of digital payment methods has seen significant progress in Saudi Arabia during recent years. Moving to a cashless society has benefits such as lower risk of financial crime, greater financial inclusion, and a more integrated economy. The ability to make faster and more secure payments will benefit both businesses and customers. The way forward for contactless payments look bright, as enforced social distancing measures will only accelerate the transition towards a cashless society. Consumers are expected to continue to stick to contactless modes of payment even after the effect of COVID-19 wanes away.

The question is whether usage of cash is going up or going down, are people moving towards a cash less economy as is being talked about by some of the influential thinkers who believe in the digital economy. Digital technologies have brought about great ease of investing in financial securities and quick conversion to cash of such assets. With such technological developments, it would be expected that consumers will prefer to stay less liquid so that they earn more by parking their money in income generating assets like flexi bank deposits or digital wallets instead of keeping hard cash in their wallets.</span>
<blockquote><span style="color: #808080;">To examine what is happening on this account, we studied the Currency in Circulation in Saudi Arabia vis- a- vis the Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) over the period 2013-2017. We also looked at the use of cash withdrawals from ATMs and use of POS for settlement of payments by consumers in the Kingdom over this period.</span></blockquote>
<span style="color: #808080;">The cash in circulation, which is the amount of cash locked up in consumers wallets, in the Saudi economy continues to grow undesirably from USD 38.2 billion in 2013 to USD 45.9 billion in 2017, forming as much as 9.5% of the country’s non-oil GDP and 16.2% of the total private final consumption expenditure in the economy. The amount is more than double the investment managed by Saudi investment funds in domestic equities of USD 18 billion and as large as the total market capitalization of Oman stock market. Also, it is three times the annual budget for Infrastructure & Transportation in the state budget. In a resource seeking economy, a large cash balance is a definite drain on the investable resources of the economy and thus pulls down the growth of the economy. Thus, the proponents of the digital economy have a valid argument that if digital economy is made fully prevalent the government can put a large chunk of these resources to better productive use.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">Further analysis of the cash withdrawals and POS transaction in Saudi economy, reveals that despite wide prevalence of debit and credit cards in the economy, POS transactions value is only about 28% of the total cash withdrawals from ATM machines. A far cry from a digital cash less economy. The total cash withdrawals at ATM machines increased from USD178 billion in 2013 to USD 194 billion in 2017. On the other hand, the POS transactions were valued at only USD 36 billion in 2013 and USD 54 billion in 2017.</span>

<span style="color: #808080;">All is not however bleak in this aspect. Analysis of the POS transactions over the period 2013-2017 reveals that the growth in POS transaction value was at CAGR of 10.7% while that of ATM cash withdrawals were at a CAGR of only 2.2%. Also, average POS transaction size has dropped steadily from SAR 506 in 2013 to SAR 283 in 2017, which is an encouraging sign of smaller transactions being financed through POS. Another important metric is the average size of cash withdrawals at ATM machines which has fallen steadily from SAR 500 in 2013 to SAR 362 in 2017 showing a shift to smaller amount stored as cash in physical wallets by the consumers. These signals bode well, but policy actions to further discourage cash-based transactions with digital transactions using the likes of digital wallets liberally can speed up the progress and release the locked-up cash resources for more productive purposes in the economy and giving a breather to the resource gaps for economic growth.</span>[:]]]></Content>

However, growth forecasts for the US economy depicts a negative outlook as the Federal Reserve voted to hold interest rates steady and shaved its growth forecast.  </span>

<span style="color: #808080;">Indian markets dominated the equity indices across the globe delivering MTD returns of 7.82% to its investors. The Chinese markets continued to offer positive returns with a 5.1% gain in March, taking the YTD gains up to a staggering 24% in 2019. The Chinese markets could see further growth upwards as the government has announced stimulus measures of nearly USD 300 billion.</span>
<span style="color: #808080;"> </span>
<span style="color: #808080;">Oil markets have continued the rally for the third straight month in 2019 as Brent Crude prices rose by an additional 3.6% to USD 68.4 during the month of March. Oil prices have found support from efforts by the OPEC and non-affiliated allies like Russia, to trim output and prices are expected to rise further.

Innovation in Islamic finance, large-scale capital needs to fund infrastructure investments, and a slump in traditional revenue streams among oil-exporting Islamic countries has spurred Sukuk issuance in the recent past. <b>Sovereign sukuk</b>, which arrived in the global arena nearly two decades back, has firmly established its presence and accounts for the majority of Sukuk issuance.

<strong>Growth in Islamic finance underpinned by Sovereign Sukuk issuance </strong>
Islamic finance has continued to prosper and gain prominence across the globe spurred by the adoption of socially responsible investing principles. The positive growth of Islamic finance has been fuelled chiefly by the growth of Sukuk amongst others, amid continued appetite from investors for alternative assets. Sukuk, an Islamic version of conventional bonds that are used to raise capital has been the most popular instrument in Islamic finance. Though Sukuk issuance accounts for a tiny fraction of the overall fixed income market, the market for Sukuk is fast growing. Global Sukuk issuance in 2018 is expected to be at USD 114.8billion in 2018, almost flat from the value raised a year back.

The sustained volume in Sukuk issuance is primarily attributed to the preference of sovereigns to raise capital through various Sukuk structures. Sovereign utilize sukuks to raise capital for a variety of purposes including to meet budgetary needs, finance infrastructure development, debt/monetary management amongst others. Encouragingly, the investor base for Sukuk has also expanded with several sovereigns, quasi-sovereign and financial institutions from Hong Kong, U.K, Malaysia, Indonesia, Pakistan, GCC Countries, Turkey, and Nigeria participating.
<blockquote>International Sukuk issuance is primarily concentrated in the Islamic markets of the Middle East (primarily GCC countries) and East Asian (Malaysia, Indonesia) countries. Financial hubs such as Hong Kong, Luxembourg, and the U.K are also active players. Of the total issuance of USD 114.8 billion in 2018, sovereign Sukuk accounted for 68% of the issues amounting to USD 78.0 billion. <b>Sovereign Sukuk</b> issuance is set raise on the back of higher fiscal deficits, sukuk refinancing needs, sovereign commitments to deepen the Sukuk market in the coming years, and is expected to reach USD 100billion by 2020.</blockquote>

The first <b>Sovereign Sukuk</b> issue was made in 2002 by Malaysia. Since then, the market has grown in size with active issuance from sovereigns across geographies. Malaysia is an active player in the <i>sovereign sukuk</i> market and its overall outstanding long-term Sukuk issuance stands at USD 84 billion. Saudi Arabia is an emerging player and has recently take up to issuing international Sukuk. In 2017, Saudi Arabia had its inaugural international sovereign Sukuk issue wherein it raised USD 9billion.

<br clear="all" /><strong>Opportunities & Challenges</strong>
Sovereigns have adopted Sukuk as a preferred way to raise capital as the cost tends to be lower. Issuance of Sukuk has been met with wide investor interest, including from hedge funds who seek investments that are less correlated with conventional bonds, thus placing a premium on the issue. Additionally, the asset-backed nature of the Sukuk instrument has enabled certain issuers to market the Sukuk with a better/higher quality credit rating. Overall, the broad investor base with significant interest and asset-backed structure of the instrument has enabled sovereigns to raise capital at a lower cost than conventional bond issues. However, the associated administrative costs, legal and accounting, along with unfamiliarity with Islamic finance have hindered the widespread adoption of Sukuk in non-Islamic markets. The illiquid nature of secondary markets for Sukuk also acts as a constraint leading to higher yields.

<strong>What needs to be done?</strong>
A conducive environment that places investor interest at the apex is critical for the Sukuk market to flourish. Currently, the standards are set by multiple international Islamic standard-setting bodies such as the Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB), Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI), and International Islamic Financial Market (IIFM). While they have contributed to regularization and standardization leading to the introduction of a variety of Islamic products, it is to be noted that the adoption and adherence to these standards are purely voluntary. Moreover, only a few jurisdictions have adopted them. The legal documentation pertaining to the Sukuk structure is yet to be standardized and is subject to diverse interpretations. The legal tussle surrounding Dana Gas Sukuk is a classic example in this regard.

To instil confidence among the various stakeholders, legal documentation surrounding the Sukuk issues needs to be simplified and standardized. The development of ‘global Sukuk standards’ is the need of the hour and it shall help address the trust deficit issues among global investors.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>
<i>Sovereign sukuk</i> market is likely to expand over the years underpinned by new issuers from both Islamic and non-Islamic countries. Supported by the investor interest in asset-backed assets, the potential for Sukuk remains immense. The need for sovereigns to diversify their debt profile could also lead to growth. However, to harness the true potential, challenges stemming from regulatory divergence and legal uncertainty need to be addressed. The establishment of global standards for Islamic issues to curb multiple interpretations of shariah principles and strict enforcement of contractual obligations could contribute to the positive development.

		<Title>[:en]GCC Stock Markets – A Tepid February[:ar]أسواق الأسهم الخليجية – أداء فاتر في فبراير[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">
<div style="text-align: left;">
<blockquote>According to our recently released <a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/the-month-that-was-gcc-stock-markets-a-tepid-february/">Monthly Market Review</a> for the month of February, GCC equity market pulled back where S&P GCC index retreated back by 1%, after a fabulous January when it zoomed by nearly 7%. At country level, some continued their upward trajectory (UAE, Bahrain and Kuwait) while others (KSA, Qatar and Oman) pulled back from their earlier rally. Globally, equities continued the bullish rally in February as indicated by MSCI World index that increased by 2.8%, extending YTD gains to 10.7%. U.S market also continued its rally as concerns surrounding trade war eased. China‘s Shanghai A-Share index became the leading gainer as conducive policy environment, easing concerns pertaining to trade war and  improving sentiments resulted in increased inflows. Emerging markets also continued the strong momentum during the month, retracing back by more than half from the decline in 2018.</blockquote>
<strong>GCC Markets: Performance of stock markets diverge</strong>

Kuwait’s market continued its steady start for the year in February. Oil and Gas sector was the key contributor rising by 5.9% during the month. Among the blue chips, Agility emerged to be the best performer in Kuwait, gaining 6.1% during the month. Boubyan Bank on the other hand wiped out its gain in previous month as it declined by 5.9% during February. The bank received the approval from CMA to raise capital by 15.75% by issuing shares. National Bank of Kuwait on the other hand extended YTD returns to 4.8% and continue to benefit from restrictions on foreign ownership cap of 49% on domestic banks being lifted.

Dubai index’s strong performance was driven by growth in earnings by banking sector. This is in stark contrast to a forgettable year of 2018 when the Dubai index declined by nearly one fourth. Among blue chip companies, First Abu Dhabi bank went up by 7.8% YTD post registering yoy growth of 32% in net income. Emirates NBD also registered a growth of 20% in net profits pushing the stock price up by 6.9% YTD. Qatar on the other hand had a remarkable year in 2018 but it lost the momentum in 2019 and was the top declining market among GCC nations in the month of February. Ezdan Holding was the worst performer, declining by 16.8% among the blue chip companies. The heavyweight, Qatar National Bank that has a market cap of over 36% of the total market cap in the country also declined by 4.9%.

Saudi Arabia index cooled off in February, after outperforming its GCC peers and the Emerging market index during previous month. Saudi Arabia is in the process of introducing regulation to allow companies from other Gulf countries to list on its stock market. Nasdaq Dubai also launched futures trading based on FTSE Russell's Saudi Arabia equity indexes that tracks a group of 46 Saudi Arabian companies.

<strong>Global Markets: Bull Run continues in equity markets</strong>

Across the globe, easing of U.S. China trade concerns and the prospect of reaching a trade deal buoyed the equity performance. In the FOMC meeting, U.S. Fed reiterated its stand to keep the interest rates on hold, which added further impetus to the rally. As a result, U.S. S&P 500 index extended its gain for the year to 11.1%. Trump also indicated towards extension of deadline of increasing tariffs on Chinese goods, citing significant progress across various key topics.

China market dominated the equity indices across the globe delivering spectacular returns to investors. Optimism surrounding trade relationship with U.S and stable yuan contributed to the positive sentiments. Average daily foreign inflows to China’s Shanghai A share index reached a record high of over CNY 4bn (Chinese yuan) during the month of February with market surging by 13.8%. ChiNext, an independent market that offers platform for tech heavy and innovative enterprises registered its best month till date, surging by 25.1%.

Oil markets continued the strong rally for the second month in a row after a subdued performance in last quarter of 2018. Oil prices rose by 6.7% during the month. Oil price movement remains volatile however the production cuts led by Saudi Arabia and the falling exports from Venezuela pushed the price upwards as rise in production elsewhere fell short of balancing the market. Goldman Sachs predicts Brent crude oil price to touch $70-$75 price range during the year as the market is expected to further tighten in the coming months. The year-end targets are however at $60 per barrel.

		<Title>[:en]Novel liquidity instruments need of the hour for Islamic financial institutions[:ar]حاجة المؤسسات المالية الإسلامية إلى أدوات سيولة جديدة[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]This article was originally published in <a title="IFN" href="https://www.islamicfinancenews.com/novel-liquidity-instruments-need-of-the-hour-for-islamic-financial-institutions.html?access-key=5ef698cd9fe650923ea331c15af3b160" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Islamic Finance News</a>.
<blockquote>Islamic finance is still a relatively small part of the broader financial services industry. Compared to the conventional industry, Islamic finance lacks adequate liquidity instruments as Shariah restrictions limit the number of instruments that could be used for liquidity management. Islamic interbank and money markets also lack the volume and diversification of conventional markets leading to a sectoral disadvantage from the outset.</blockquote>
<strong>Review of 2018 </strong>
Since 2015, there has been a reduction of liquidity in the banking systems in the Middle Eastern region, mainly due to reduced deposit inflows because of low oil prices and a high dependence on deposits from governments and their related entities. This situation has improved in 2018 after oil prices stabilized and governments issued large bonds and injected liquidity locally. However, the dearth of Islamic liquidity management instruments has been a challenge in Islamic banking ever since its inception. The instruments that meet both the industry’s needs and the stakeholders’ expectations are relatively few. The excess liquidity of Islamic banks limit their profitability potential and therefore their long-term viability, it also dampens the effect of monetary policy interventions in the financial markets by central banks.

The onset of Basel III liquidity coverage requirements is likely to exacerbate the problem as Islamic banks will need to maintain high quality short-term liquid assets. As a result, Islamic banks, which are concentrated in the Middle East, hold 8.8% of their assets in cash and equivalents and 9.8% of their assets in placements at other financial institutions. Currently, Islamic banks place liquid funds through short-term instruments such as commodity Murabahah that are non-tradable on secondary markets — Shariah rules prohibit trading on receivables. Moreover, stakeholders typically view these inflexible instruments as artificial replications of interest based transactions. Alternative instruments are gauged against three criteria: whether they are as cost-effective as commodity Murabahah, whether they offer the same or enhanced flexibility and liquidity, and whether they offer sufficient scale to meet the current and anticipated future needs.

<strong>Preview of 2019 </strong>
New strategies to meet the liquidity management needs of Islamic banks and Islamic windows at conventional banks are being developed. These products — including National Bonds’ Sukuk Trading Platform addresses both the operational needs of Islamic banks and preferences of their customers and external stakeholders. In liquidity management, it has the potential to be both flexible and authentic, offering an investment destination for surplus funds or a tool with which financial institutions and central banks can look to as a model for providing liquidity to banks when needed. Islamic banks will shift toward Islamic liquidity management instruments that increase their ability to place more of their surplus liquidity with other banks or with the central bank.
Closer integration may also lead to increasing Sukuk issuance, which could reduce Takaful operators’ exposure to riskier real estate and equities investments or help banks manage their liquidity. Sukuk could also provide investment funds with additional fixed-income revenue, and encourage a shift toward more profit-and-loss sharing instruments. In addition, Islamic banks could start offering Takaful products more systematically if the relevant regulation is in place.

Standalone Islamic banks will have to look to government Islamic T-bills, or other instruments to place most of their surplus liquidity. Some of the remainder will be held on balance sheets as cash in order to manage unexpected shocks because of a smaller set of central bank instruments. A portion of the assets they hold today as cash will be shifted to interbank placements in order to generate yields. However, given the cyclicality of excess liquidity in GCC banks, there will probably be a continued reliance on commodity Murabahah, which amounts to an effective outsourcing of some of the cash management responsibilities at Islamic banks to Islamic windows, which have a deeper set of options and more access to international liquidity management instruments.

<strong>Conclusion </strong>
Islamic liquidity management instruments are still at their infancy, and the main challenge is in providing liquidity management tools that can compete with conventional ones. Therefore, Islamic financial institutions should invest more in product development. In particular, as Islamic finance grows, the problem of liquidity will grow bigger, as central bank support would become expensive particularly for larger institutions.

Although a variety of approaches have been adopted in different jurisdictions, much work remains to be done to diversify the mix of available options for Islamic banks to manage their short to medium-term liquidity. Further, the divergence in Shariah interpretations across different jurisdictions has so far stifled a truly global approach toward tackling this issue. In this regard, the setting up of organizations providing Shariah standards such as AAOIFI and the IFSB are playing an important role in bridging this gap. Liquidity management continues to remain at the core of the issue that regulators need to address to ensure the healthy growth and development of the Islamic banking sector.[:ar]This article was originally published in <a title="IFN" href="https://www.islamicfinancenews.com/novel-liquidity-instruments-need-of-the-hour-for-islamic-financial-institutions.html?access-key=5ef698cd9fe650923ea331c15af3b160" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Islamic Finance News</a>.

<blockquote>According to our recently released <a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/the-month-that-was-equities-off-to-a-flying-start-in-2019/">Monthly Market Review</a> for the month of January, GCC equity markets greeted its investors in celebratory fashion, recording its highest monthly gains in over two years. Investor sentiment was bullish, as the influx of foreign funds, uptick in oil prices and expansionary budget policies are all expected to support corporate earnings growth in 2019. The story was no different in the global markets, as equities continued to be the flavour of the month among investors. The U.S. and Emerging Markets witnessed a reversal in fortunes, putting the misery of 2018 behind them. A recovery in oil prices was also underway, as U.S and China take steps to resolve the trade dispute while Saudi Arabia affirms its commitment to avoid a supply glut.</blockquote>
<strong>GCC Markets: Gearing up for additional foreign inflows </strong>
Kuwait’s market was off to a strong start in 2019, gaining 2.5%, after disappointing in the fourth quarter of last year. The index performance was led by banking stocks, which were boosted by the decision to lift the foreign ownership cap of 49% on domestic banks. National Bank of Kuwait and Boubyan Bank gained 4.1% and 3.4% respectively for the month. The news of Kuwait Financial House and Ahli United Bank agreeing upon a merger invoked mixed response from shareholders, as Ahli United Bank soared by 13.7% for the month while KFH witnessed its share price fall by 0.5% in the same period.

The S&P GCC index recorded its best start to a year in recent years, gaining 6.8% for the month, boosted by the strength in Saudi stocks. Saudi Arabia outperformed its GCC peers, rising up by 9.4% in January. Qatar, Abu Dhabi, Bahrain and Kuwait also ended the month positively, gaining 4.1%, 4.0%, 2.6% and 2.5% respectively. Dubai market, which was the biggest loser of 2018, witnessed a rise of 1.5%. Oman was the only drag on the index, losing 3.6% for the month. The strength in Saudi equity markets was led by the rally in large cap stocks that are expected to be part of the MSCI EM benchmarks after the inclusion of Saudi Arabia into the Emerging Market indices. Rebound in oil prices, inflow of foreign funds and the increase in capital expenditure projected in the budget were all positive triggers that helped the country’s equity markets. Qatar was the next best performer, extending its positive performance of 2018 into the New Year.

Ezdan Holdings, Al-Rajhi Bank and Samba Financial Group were the top gainers among Blue Chips, rising by 20.4%, 15.7%, and 15.6% respectively for the month.  Samba, Saudi Arabia’s third largest bank by total assets, witnessed an uptick in prices after reporting a rise in yearly earnings. Al-Rajhi Bank’s prices also went up as Malaysia’s Central Bank gave the nod for Malaysian Industrial Development Finance (MIDF), a state-backed Malaysian lender, to conduct negotiations with Al Rajhi Bank over a potential merger deal.

<strong>Global Markets: Positivity returns to equity markets</strong>
Global equities were off to a flying start in 2019, with several major markets gaining sharply. The month started on a positive note for the U.S. markets, before weak earnings of selected blue chip stocks partially erased the gains in due course of the month. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell brought cheer to the markets after stating that the Fed will be flexible in its plan of hiking interest rates. The softening stand from the Federal Reserve was perceived positively by the markets. After the announcement, the Dow soared by 3.3% on Jan 4, its fourth biggest single-day rally of all time. The S&P 500 index gained 7.9% for the month while the MSCI World Index gained 7.7% during the same period. Europe showed signs of volatility throughout the month, as the markets keenly observe the developments surrounding the Brexit deal. European markets received a lift after Theresa May’s Brexit deal was rejected by the Parliament. Germany’s DAX index gained 5.8% during the month while UK’s FTSE index closed with gains of 3.6%. Asian Markets remained mixed as China and Japan outperformed India. India’s SENSEX closed with modest gains of 0.6% in January, as concerns over general election weighed on investor sentiment. The MSCI EM index witnessed a sharp rebound, gaining 8.7% in January after shedding nearly 17% in 2018.

Oil markets witnessed a sharp rebound after a subdued close to 2018. Oil prices rose by 15.0% during the month, snapping a three-month losing streak. Volatility in the oil markets refuse to die down as production cut announcements, concerns over demand and fresh sanctions caused the prices to fluctuate. Saudi Arabia’s commitment to production cuts supported the oil price while China’s slowdown in manufacturing sector acted as a minor drag in January. Oil prices surged further towards the close of the month, reacting to the U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s crude exports.

		<Title>[:en]Oil Price may not be the trigger for reforms[:ar]أسعار النفط قد لا تكون محفزاً لتنفيذ الإصلاحات[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div>

This article was originally published in Al Qabas

Analyzing the historical trend of reforms in Kuwait, one can notice that financial services sector is the most regulated and therefore have experienced more reforms while sectors like healthcare and legal saw the least number of reforms. For a balanced and sustained economic growth, an even distribution of reforms across all critical sectors is a must.

A popular coffee table discussion in Kuwait is to ask “when will serious reforms come to Kuwait?” and the answer invariably is “When oil price crash to $10”. We all know how dependent Kuwait economy is to oil price and hence this strong view that reforms will fast track once oil price experiences severe and prolonged correction. While such a narrative is intuitively appealing, it is flawed at a certain level. For a small country in terms of size and population (1 million Kuwaitis approximately), Kuwait sits on a disproportionately large fiscal reserves. Successive surplus over several decades have been bulging up in the Sovereign Wealth Fund (KIA) and is estimated to be around $640 billion. While the GDP per capita is otherwise stated as $ 33,994 which itself is a healthy number, if we calculate GDP per capita excluding expats (as they don’t have any claim), the GDP per capita shoots up to $ 113,312. In addition, another way to measure the comfort is to see the reserve coverage ratio of expenditure. Kuwait’s annual expenditure at $69 billion provides a cover of 9.3 times in terms of reserves. To state the same thing differently, Kuwait will be able to manage without a single dollar of oil revenues (wishful though) for 9.3 years before there will be a need to borrow. One can only think of very few countries in the world that possess this much comfort. It is precisely for this reason that reforms need not kick in even if oil price falls to $10.

If oil price cannot trigger reforms, what will? The short answer is jobs. If one has to understand the jobs problem, we should appreciate the evolving demography of Kuwait alongside the role of private sector.  But before that, let us see what the size of the problem is. It is interesting to quote IMF here “Between 2012–16, staff projects 74,000–112,000 Kuwaitis would enter the labor market. The private sector is projected to create 17,000 jobs for Kuwaitis, and without significant structural reforms, the government will feel the pressure to absorb the remaining entrants at a faster pace than in the past, further increasing government employment by 13–22 percent (with a fiscal cost of less than one percent of GDP per year)<strong>” </strong>This is clearly unsustainable going forward. Public sector pay levels are higher compared to private sector while the work demands are low. This heavily incentivizes citizens to aim for public sector jobs first. No wonder nearly 90% of working nationals are now in public sector. Ability to absorb in the public sector   will hit a tipping point shortly if not already hit. On the other hand, private sector is presently too small to fill the gap. It is clear that future job creation has to happen in the private sector but that will require giving space to private sector to grow and create the needed jobs. Given the fact that private sector growth is still heavily dependent on government spending, we need to create a business ecosystem that will enable private sector to thrive, grow and create jobs regardless of government spending. Most, if not all of the essential services (like healthcare, education, etc) are provided by the government and ministries providing these services are already experiencing excess employment situation. Unless some of these service provisions are delegated to private sector, creating jobs by private sector can remain a pipe dream. Also, heavy encouragement of Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) can create the necessary impetus for job creation through foreign investment.

Therefore, in order to create real meaningful jobs, the government should scale down and the private sector should scale up. The former can happen through privatization while the later can happen through PPP projects. It is generally argued that privatization is anti‐jobs (as it involves downsizing) and hence cannot be a solution to mounting jobs problem. While this is true in the short‐term, privatization will also unlock value in terms of providing market‐based services, which can be growth accretive. While in the short term, it may be anti‐jobs, in the long run it is certainly job‐creating tool. While more jobs can be created through means suggested above, the demand for jobs should also match the supply, which will require extensive and thoughtful revisit of education delivery at several levels. One can easily see that such efforts will lead to more not less reforms. As the pressure on jobs front mount and increase, reforms to enlarge the size of the private sector, and reduce the size of the public sector along with educational reforms will become dire need than choices.

</div>
Another factor is the evolving demography of Kuwait where nearly 57% of Kuwaiti citizens fall within the working age bracket of 25to 54 years. By 2030, this is expected to reach 60 %. In a world dominated by ageing countries, Kuwait along with other GCC countries will remain young for a long period to come. While this is a good news from a productivity point of view, it is also the reason why number of new entrants to labor market will increase year after year adding to the jobs   pressure.

Hence, I will argue that the overall economic reforms momentum is highly dependent on the increasing jobs pressure than the level of oil price.[:ar]<div>

		<Title>[:en]Deep Learning: A more interesting aspect of AI[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]This article originally published in AME Info.

Deep Learning has become one of the most discussed and researched topics of the decade. Deep learning is evolving day by day, and therefore, it is important to understand how and why it works. Deep learning sits at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning.. AI basically implies a range of technologies that enable computer and robots to solve problems in ways that resemble human thinking process.

Within this realm is a smaller, yet significant component known as machine learning which enables software to function and predict outcomes more accurately without requiring external programming. Deep learning is the subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks having layers of learning capacities and algorithms to process large amounts of data.

Data is the fundamental resource that makes deep learning possible as its algorithm requires tons of data to learn from. Global Internet population has increased 7.5% in 2016 to reach 3.7 billion people in 2017. The amount of data that is generated every day is currently estimated at 2.6 quintillion bytes (www.forbes.com). Higher computing power and the widespread use of AI-as–a-service which has given smaller organizations access to AI and AI algorithm without a large initial investment has strengthened deep learning.

<strong>Real World applications of Deep Learning</strong>

Deep learning models are applied to big data for knowledge discovery, knowledge application, and knowledge-based prediction, making it a powerful engine for producing effective and actionable results.  It has the potential to learn from unlabeled or unstructured data. A few of the real-world applications of deep learning are listed below:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Customer Experience</strong></li>
</ul>
Businesses use deep learning to enhance the customer experience by personalizing it. Combining usage analytics, AI and machine learning capabilities, customer data can be utilized to provide unique services and experience to each customer. It also enables self-service to customers, thus increasing operational efficiency of the organization. It also ensures customer satisfaction which is key for customer retention. Deep learning models are already in use for chatbots with respect to enhancing customer experience.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Translations</strong></li>
</ul>
Deep learning improves automatic translation of texts with the use of stacked networks of neural networks and allowing translations from images.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Adding color to images</strong></li>
</ul>
Deep learning algorithms can be used to automatically add color to black and white images in a much faster way. They use the contexts and objects in the images to color them, thus recreating black- and white images in color accurately.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Autonomous Vehicles</strong></li>
</ul>
There are multiple deep learning models at work simultaneously in the case of autonomous vehicles. Some specialize in street signs while others are trained to recognize pedestrians. Various AI models work in isolation and combination to provide the vehicle with the apt commands while it is in operation.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Computer Vision</strong></li>
</ul>
Deep learning enables machines to automate the tasks performed by humans. It provides accuracy in image classification, object detention, image restoration and image segmentation.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Image Caption generation</strong></li>
</ul>
Deep learning has the capacity to recognize an image and develop an appropriate caption using an appropriate sentence structure and punctuation, similar to what a human can write.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>News aggregator based on sentiment</strong></li>
</ul>
With the use of sentiment analysis or opinion mining, the attitude of an individual; or group regarding a particular topic or overall context is determined. This is used by news aggregators to filter and stream news relevant to the audiences’ interests.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Medicines and pharmaceuticals</strong></li>
</ul>
In the field of medical sciences particularly in diagnosis and personalized medicine creation using the individual’s genome, deep learning is making huge impact.

Enormous computational power is required to solve deep learning problems and develop deep learning models because of the iterative nature of its algorithms, their complexity it goes up the hierarchy, and the large volumes of data needed to train the networks.

At present, deep learning is at a very nascent stage, hence the limitations of its algorithms are still being explored. Despite the progress in the field, experts say that human level AI is still far from being achieved. The current models can only perform local generalization which means that they are capable of adapting to new situations that must be similar to past data.

On the contrary, human cognition is capable of extreme generalization, quickly adapting to completely unprecedented situations and planning for long-term future situations with the power of abstract modeling of hypothetical situations.

<strong>Applications of AI in Banking, Investing, Insurance and Capital Markets</strong>
The most basic type of AI is the <em>Expert System</em><em>.</em> This is a decision-making system that is rule-based, making logical decisions based on known rules, and can learn mostly through inference. Some others make use of deep neural networks (DNN).

A<em>rtificial Neural Networks (ANN)</em> are inspired by peoples’ own human brains. They learn by observing and increase their knowledge from processing the material that they experience. A website offers AI Product that continuously follows over 400 of the highest volume stocks from the Dow, S&amp;P500, and NASDAQ.

It gives buy/sell/hold signals throughout the day, with the percentage of confidence in that signal stated to be nearing 100% near the end of the trading day. It does not trade for use. It simply provides a signal that investor can follow by choice. How one follows is up to investor. Other applications are mentioned below:

<strong>- Speeding up Transaction:</strong> Investors began tinkering with AI technology to increase the number of stocks that could be purchased simultaneously and automatically if a given set of market parameters are met.

<strong>- Predicting Stock Trends:</strong> Traders began to really take notice of the capabilities of AI technology, however, when the first algorithms predicting market trends were produced at the end of the last century.

Companies like Neural Tip use neural networks that are stated to be composed of multiple layers of nodes that use predetermined algorithms and trends seen in raw data to model market trends, effectively thinking about and drawing conclusions from the input information based on stock trading signals. Even more impressively, these systems are claimed to be able to learn new models and relationships between data according to newly compiled data.

It is reported that non-linear decision making computer programs that attempt to make the “best” decision not based on linear logic but instead on random inputs (like the information many people would have concerning a stock) are attempting to more closely model the type of decision making used by humans in an effort to better reflect our comprehensive problem solving capabilities.

According to a report by Accenture, capital markets are poised to be transformed by AI. However, until now, most firms have focused on using these technologies to cut costs, but AI has the potential to create value across the organization in entirely new ways.

What makes AI so transformative is its ability to learn. Deterministic technologies that mimic human behaviors are being superseded by intelligent systems that not only perform at or beyond human capacity, but evolve and develop new capabilities like people too. That’s creating new opportunities for capital markets firms to not only cut costs, but to add value for clients, employees and other stakeholders across the organization.

<strong>AI in Banking</strong>
AI technologies are increasingly being applied in the banking industry, mainly toward knowledge management, identity authentication, market analysis, customer relationship management, anti-money laundering, and risk control.

ANN have been tested to the complex banks’ problem of credit risk analysis. The tests have been to assess whether Stochastic neural networks can improve the credit rating accuracy of conventional deterministic system. Demographic and biographic information, in addition to traditional financial and economic credit scoring information, is also used as inputs to the ANN classifier in order to determine if the ability and accuracy of predicting credit default can be increased.

In insurance industry, from the first interaction (when determining what coverage is best to ongoing customer service), machines are continuing to play an increasing role in customer service.

According to one survey, most customers don’t have an issue with interacting with a bot; 74% of consumers would be happy to get computer-generated insurance advice. As a highly regulated industry, the insurance industry processes thousands of claims and responds to thousands of customer queries. AI is being used to improve this process and move claims through the system from initial report to communicating with the customer.

In some cases, these claims do not require any human interaction at all. Those companies that have already begun to automate portions of their claims process are realizing the time savings and increased quality of service.[:]]]></Content>

		<Title>[:en]Oil on a Slippery Slope - Kuwait Stock Market Positive in November[:ar]وضعٌ حرج للنفط – أداء إيجابي لسوق الكويت للأوراق المالية في نوفمبر[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">
<div style="text-align: left;">
<blockquote>According to our recently released Monthly Market Review for the month of November, GCC equity markets took a downturn due to the negative performance of the UAE and Saudi Arabian markets. Global equities saw a positive momentum buoyed by a strong recovery in the emerging markets. Kuwait was the best performing GCC market during the month, gaining 1.3% for the month of November.</blockquote>
Kuwait finally broke out of its three-month losing streak and became the best performing market in the GCC region for the month of November. The Kuwait All Share Index gained 1.3% for the month with the YTD returns moving up to 8.4% as investors welcomed the initiatives by Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK) to revive the credit growth and boost consumer spending by increasing the personal loan limit from KD 15,000 to KD 25,000. Zain Telecommunications, which registered the biggest loss in the month of October, emerged to be the best performing blue chip Company from Kuwait, gaining 4% during the month. Boubyan Bank continues to be one of the best performing blue chip stocks, with a monthly gain of 3.4% and an YTD return of 30.5%. Recently, Boursa Kuwait introduced an electronic platform that shall enable the existing Over-The-Counter (OTC) market move to a platform for conducting transactions, which shall benefit investors in trading unlisted securities. Interestingly, liquidity in Boursa Kuwait increased during the month, with average daily value traded increasing by nearly 7% compared to October.

The S&P GCC index took a downturn in the month of November. The index fell 2% for the month, drawing down on the overall gains for the year, which now stand at 7.6%. This was mainly due to the sharp fall in oil prices, the continued trade war uncertainties and geo political concerns plaguing Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and Dubai saw large pullbacks with the Saudi Tadawul index, Abu Dhabi index and the DFM General Index falling 2.6%, 2.7% and 4.2% for the month of November, respectively.

The beat down in Dubai stocks continued for the fourth straight month as Dubai’s DFM General Index extended its losing streak, falling by 4.2% during November and 20.8% in YTD 2018, making it the worst performing market in the GCC region for the November month. The impact of a steep fall in the oil market as well as geopolitical concerns were finally visible in the Saudi stock market with the main index falling 2.6% for the month. Overall, Qatar and Bahrain indices gained 0.6%, and 1.1% respectively, whereas, the Oman and Abu Dhabi index lost 0.2% and 2.7% during the month. Ezdan holdings and Masraf Al Raya were the top two performers among GCC blue chip companies, rising by 16.4% and 5.5% during the month respectively.

<strong>Global Market Updates</strong>

The U.S. markets have been volatile this month as energy companies were battered due to a free fall in oil prices and a slump in tech stocks brought the S&P 500 Index down to its lowest levels in five months. However, recovery seen in the last weeks of trading pushed the S&P 500 to register a MTD performance of 1.8%. The Federal Reserve is still expected to raise interest rates next month and three times next year, but US Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said that there is some evidence the world economy is cooling down and that they would be more cautious moving forward on their pace of increasing interest rates. MSCI World Index gained just 1.0% in the month of November.

The economy is facing a growing number of headwinds, including the lagged effect of previous interest rate rises and dollar strength, the uncertainty of trade protectionism at a time when external demand is slowing, and a sense that the support from the fiscal stimulus will gradually fade. The main risk to the upside likely stems from the tight jobs market and whether wages can continue rising. According to the estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 3.5% in the third quarter of 2018 as compared to a growth of 4.2 % in the second quarter.

Trade tensions and tightening financial conditions was the primary contributor to weakness in EM equities last month but we saw strength returning to the markets this month. MSCI EM index went up 4.1% in the month of November. A slower pace of US Fed rate hikes would weaken the dollar and aid emerging markets moving forward. Morgan Stanley said it upgraded emerging market stocks from "underweight" to "overweight" for 2019, while U.S. equities were downgraded to "underweight". On the other hand, the UK continues to be plagued by Brexit uncertainties with the markets falling 2.1% this month. Britain is due to exit the world's biggest trading bloc on March 29 but it remains unclear whether British PM Theresa May's draft divorce deal agreed with the EU will pass in the parliament on Dec. 11.

The oil market was under focus this month as we saw an acceleration in price downturn. West Texas Intermediate crude is down close to 33.06 % since hitting a four-year high of $76.41 in October and a MTD fall of 22.07%. Brent crude continued to fall adding to its momentum from last month, with a MTD performance of -22.2%. Record high oil production from the United States and a slowing global demand for the commodity can be cited as reasons for the negative performance in the oil market. China’s demand for oil by-products, dropped to the lowest level in 13 months, according to Reuters. Additionally, exemption of eight countries, including India and China, by the U.S. from the sanctions imposed on Iran contributed to the supply overhang. OPEC is preparing to pull back output on expectations that the oil market will be oversupplied next year.

		<Title>[:en]Dubai Stock Market: Is this just another correction?[:ar]سوق دبي المالي: هل هذا مجرد تصحيح آخر؟[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">
<div style="text-align: left;">

For over two decades, Dubai has prospered as one of the fastest developing international cities, attracting people and capital from all across the globe. In 2009, Dubai needed a $20 billion bailout from oil-rich Abu Dhabi to escape a debt crisis caused by collapsing property prices. Dubai’s economy roared back and has grown by a third since then, buoyed by foreign trade, tourism and its status as the main regional hub for business services.

Now, however, Dubai has hit another rough patch with residential property prices dropping by more than 15 percent since late 2014 and still falling. Economic activity in the Emirate has been lagging as real estate prices dropped and domestic demand faltered, prompting the government to announce a series of measures to stimulate growth. Traditional growth engines of Dubai economy such as real estate, trade, transport & hospitality have remained weak.

UAE's Non-Oil Private Sector Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), an indicator of economic health, has increased to 55.3 in September of 2018 from a five-month low of 55.0 made in August showing some strength returning to the economy. After peaking out at 61.2 in late 2014, it fell significantly to lows of 51.7 in 2016. Currently it has been hovering around the mean level of 55 (Trading Economics). Credit card spending on consumer goods fell around 5% year on year in Q1 2018, leading to a slower growth rate in the consumer spending index of just 7% in Q1, 2018 compared to a nearly 12% rise a year earlier (ADCB Report).

The Dubai Financial Market General Index has tumbled close to 20 percent (Reuters, as of 14<sup>th</sup> of October) this year as real estate prices in Dubai have dropped and domestic demand has faltered. Real Estate and Construction stocks constitute a large portion of the overall Dubai market (>40%) (DFM General Index) and this has weighed down the general index, extending the loss for the year. On a valuation basis, the overall market looks highly undervalued, currently trading at a P/E of 7.5 when compared with the S&P GCC Composite Index valuation of 14.8.

<strong>Dubai Stock Market has been on a steady decline in 2018</strong>

<strong>Corporate Earnings growth (YoY)</strong>

<span style="color: #808080; font-size: 10px;">Source: Reuters</span>
<blockquote>Overall, the corporate earnings growth can be seen to be on a downward trend since the peak of 2014. Though we have witnessed healthy growth in earnings in the recent quarters, 19.4% for Q2, 2018 when compared with the same period last year – the growth has been on a base that has remained stagnant since the year 2016.</blockquote>
<strong>Individual Sectoral returns for 2018 paint a grim picture of the overall Dubai Market:</strong>
<img title="Individual Sectoral returns for 2018 paint a grim picture of the overall Dubai Market:" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Dubai_Stock_Market_Mamore_Blog_Fig3.jpg" alt="Individual Sectoral returns for 2018 paint a grim picture of the overall Dubai Market:" />
<span style="color: #808080; font-size: 10px;">Source: Reuters</span>

While looking at the individual sector returns, almost all the major sectors have displayed negative returns in 2018 with consumer discretionary and real estate leading the charts. The continued fall seen in the real estate markets and the lack of investor confidence in the midst of geo political uncertainties has led to negative returns throughout the market.

<strong>Top 5 gainers on a quarterly basis</strong>

<span style="color: #808080; font-size: 10px;">*Quarter on Quarter Growth; Source: Reuters</span>

While analyzing the top 5 gainers among blue chips, we see that almost all are dominated by the financial sector. The financial sector mainly the banks have benefited greatly from a rise in their interest income in 2018 due to the consistent rise in the Fed fund rates. Emirates Islamic Bank, Commercial Bank of Dubai And Ajman Bank have seen tremendous growth in their earnings growth the first and second quarter of 2018 as compared to the similar period in 2017.

<strong>Top 5 losers on a quarterly basis</strong>
<img title="Top 5 losers on a quarterly basis" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Dubai_Stock_Market_Mamore_Blog_Fig5.jpg" alt="Top 5 losers on a quarterly basis" />
<span style="color: #808080; font-size: 10px;">*Quarter on Quarter Growth; Source: Reuters</span>

On the other end of the spectrum when we analyse the top 5 losers among blue-chip, we see that they are dominated by companies from the real estate & construction and transportation & warehousing sector. Damac Properties and Deyaar Development have seen a continued fall in their quarter two earnings growth complementing the depressed real estate market in Dubai. However, the loss figures can be seen as somewhat narrowing when compared to the second quarter earnings growth of 2017, which can suggest that the real estate market prices may finally be bottoming out. The other sectors seen to be negatively impacted is that of transportation and warehousing and manufacturing with companies like Dubai Investments and Air Arabia registering large fall in earnings growth in the second quarter of 2018.

<strong>Reasons for the fall in the Dubai Markets</strong>
After years of registering strong growth, passenger growth at Dubai airport has remained muted fueling concerns that growth has saturated. Growth in passenger traffic through Dubai’s international airport has fallen to near zero this year, after 15 years of strong increases. Increasingly, long-range aircraft may loosen Dubai’s dominance as a travel hub connecting Asia and Europe.

<strong>Passenger Traffic Data</strong>

TTourism has been subdued with Dubai hotel’s revenue per available room (RevPAR) decreasing by 13.3 per cent from USD 271 in April 2017 to USD235 in April 2018, attributed to an increase in both hotel supply and traveller preferences for more affordable accommodation (Dubai Statistics Center). Business sentiment has remained subdued with Dubai issuing 4,722 new business licenses in the second quarter of 2018, down 26 per cent from the same period in 2016, the year when new licenses peaked.

Earlier this month, S&P Global Ratings cut the credit worthiness of two local companies, Dubai Electricity and Water Authority to BBB from BBB-plus and DIFC Investments to BBB-minus one-step above junk status, from BBB, citing the weakening economy of Dubai. Thus, downgrade has added more pressure on the economy as Dubai does not have a separate sovereign rating like its neighboring emirate Abu Dhabi, the credit rating of its state owned companies is often perceived as an indicator for the economy.

Official data shows Dubai's population continued to expand by 3.5 per cent to 3.08 million in the first half of 2018. However, most of the growth in recent years has been in lower-paid construction and services jobs, rather than in higher-paid white-collar posts. It is currently uncertain whether Dubai’s transportation industry and economic zones will be able to grow fast enough to attract and retain foreign white-collar workers needed to support the demand for its real estate market.

Dubai has been facing unprecedented competition from neighboring countries for capital, as low oil prices forced those countries to develop their own non-oil industries. Portfolio funds are already flowing from Dubai's stock market to Saudi Arabia's bourse. A recent Reuters poll shows that Middle East fund managers intend to allocate more money into Saudi Arabian equities while decreasing their exposures to UAE. The fund flows into Saudi Arabia have come partly at the expense of other markets in the region, particularly those in the United Arab Emirates.

A major factor contributing to the fall in the real estate prices stem from the fact that the upfront costs of purchasing a property in Dubai precludes many from buying. Dubai has a mortgage cap in place, which means that a buyer purchasing a property valued at Dh5 million or less needs approximately a third of the property value in cash.

<strong>Road Ahead for Dubai</strong>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects Dubai’s economy to gradually recover as the government accelerates spending in preparation for the Expo 2020 event and estimate the gross domestic product to expand over 3% in 2019.

<strong>Growth forecast by the IMF remains Optimistic</strong>

<span style="color: #808080; font-size: 10px;">Source: IMF</span>

The Expo 2020 event in Dubai could drive up GDP growth by 2 percentage points between 2020 and 2021 by boosting job creation, consumption, and tourism. However, it must be kept in mind that much of the growth seen in 2018 is due to a big rise in state spending as Dubai builds infrastructure to host the Expo 2020 world's fair. The 2018 budget rose to a record 56.6 billion dirhams (USD 15.4 billion), a 19.5 per cent rise from 2017 levels. It is unfeasible to imagine that the government can keep boosting its expenditure at this speed indefinitely.

Recent structural reforms, including plans to introduce long-term expatriate visas for up to 10 years, could help to boost the UAE’s population and consumer demand. The new UAE long-term and temporary visa system should facilitate retention of white-collar expatriates, which may increase expatriate incentives to acquire property and support real estate demand.

Potentially the most far-reaching reform was recently announced by the UAE cabinet, which would allow 100 per cent foreign ownership of some UAE-based businesses, up from the current 49 per cent limit. However, details of the new policy have not been released yet, and implementing it may be tricky. The existing free zones in Dubai already permit 100 per cent foreign ownership which could suffer if they no longer have this right exclusively.

The UAE cabinet approved plans in June for the insurance scheme to replace the previous system whereby employers had to provide a monetary guarantee to cover each of their workforce. The new UAE-wide insurance scheme may provide a one-time boost to corporate profits. The move is likely to free up capital that companies could choose to reinvest which could lead to a one-off 0.1 percentage point boost to UAE non-hydrocarbon real GDP growth (Bank of America Merrill Lynch).

The new Federal Government debt law lays the foundations for the development of a bond market in dirham denomination in the UAE. This is important as it will create deeper, more resilient financial markets, benchmark the yield curve, provide more diversified sources of financing, mobilise additional domestic savings and attract capital inflow. This would help reduce reliance on bank financing, external borrowing or withdrawals from SWFs. UAE’s non-oil economy is likely to turn next year with Dubai’s Expo 2020 infrastructure projects, changes to visa rules and increased government spending set to boost growth.

For over two decades, Dubai has prospered as one of the fastest developing international cities, attracting people and capital from all across the globe. In 2009, Dubai needed a $20 billion bailout from oil-rich Abu Dhabi to escape a debt crisis caused by collapsing property prices. Dubai’s economy roared back and has grown by a third since then, buoyed by foreign trade, tourism and its status as the main regional hub for business services.

Now, however, Dubai has hit another rough patch with residential property prices dropping by more than 15 percent since late 2014 and still falling. Economic activity in the Emirate has been lagging as real estate prices dropped and domestic demand faltered, prompting the government to announce a series of measures to stimulate growth. Traditional growth engines of Dubai economy such as real estate, trade, transport & hospitality have remained weak.

UAE's Non-Oil Private Sector Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), an indicator of economic health, has increased to 55.3 in September of 2018 from a five-month low of 55.0 made in August showing some strength returning to the economy. After peaking out at 61.2 in late 2014, it fell significantly to lows of 51.7 in 2016. Currently it has been hovering around the mean level of 55 (Trading Economics). Credit card spending on consumer goods fell around 5% year on year in Q1 2018, leading to a slower growth rate in the consumer spending index of just 7% in Q1, 2018 compared to a nearly 12% rise a year earlier (ADCB Report).

The Dubai Financial Market General Index has tumbled close to 20 percent (Reuters, as of 14<sup>th</sup> of October) this year as real estate prices in Dubai have dropped and domestic demand has faltered. Real Estate and Construction stocks constitute a large portion of the overall Dubai market (>40%) (DFM General Index) and this has weighed down the general index, extending the loss for the year. On a valuation basis, the overall market looks highly undervalued, currently trading at a P/E of 7.5 when compared with the S&P GCC Composite Index valuation of 14.8.

<blockquote>Overall, the corporate earnings growth can be seen to be on a downward trend since the peak of 2014. Though we have witnessed healthy growth in earnings in the recent quarters, 19.4% for Q2, 2018 when compared with the same period last year – the growth has been on a base that has remained stagnant since the year 2016.</blockquote>
<strong>Individual Sectoral returns for 2018 paint a grim picture of the overall Dubai Market:</strong>
<img title="Individual Sectoral returns for 2018 paint a grim picture of the overall Dubai Market:" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Dubai_Stock_Market_Mamore_Blog_Fig3.jpg" alt="Individual Sectoral returns for 2018 paint a grim picture of the overall Dubai Market:" />
<span style="color: #808080; font-size: 10px;">Source: Reuters</span>

While looking at the individual sector returns, almost all the major sectors have displayed negative returns in 2018 with consumer discretionary and real estate leading the charts. The continued fall seen in the real estate markets and the lack of investor confidence in the midst of geo political uncertainties has led to negative returns throughout the market.

While analyzing the top 5 gainers among blue chips, we see that almost all are dominated by the financial sector. The financial sector mainly the banks have benefited greatly from a rise in their interest income in 2018 due to the consistent rise in the Fed fund rates. Emirates Islamic Bank, Commercial Bank of Dubai And Ajman Bank have seen tremendous growth in their earnings growth the first and second quarter of 2018 as compared to the similar period in 2017.

<strong>Top 5 losers on a quarterly basis</strong>

<span style="color: #808080; font-size: 10px;">*Quarter on Quarter Growth; Source: Reuters</span>

On the other end of the spectrum when we analyse the top 5 losers among blue-chip, we see that they are dominated by companies from the real estate & construction and transportation & warehousing sector. Damac Properties and Deyaar Development have seen a continued fall in their quarter two earnings growth complementing the depressed real estate market in Dubai. However, the loss figures can be seen as somewhat narrowing when compared to the second quarter earnings growth of 2017, which can suggest that the real estate market prices may finally be bottoming out. The other sectors seen to be negatively impacted is that of transportation and warehousing and manufacturing with companies like Dubai Investments and Air Arabia registering large fall in earnings growth in the second quarter of 2018.

<strong>Reasons for the fall in the Dubai Markets</strong>
After years of registering strong growth, passenger growth at Dubai airport has remained muted fueling concerns that growth has saturated. Growth in passenger traffic through Dubai’s international airport has fallen to near zero this year, after 15 years of strong increases. Increasingly, long-range aircraft may loosen Dubai’s dominance as a travel hub connecting Asia and Europe.

<strong>Passenger Traffic Data</strong>

TTourism has been subdued with Dubai hotel’s revenue per available room (RevPAR) decreasing by 13.3 per cent from USD 271 in April 2017 to USD235 in April 2018, attributed to an increase in both hotel supply and traveller preferences for more affordable accommodation (Dubai Statistics Center). Business sentiment has remained subdued with Dubai issuing 4,722 new business licenses in the second quarter of 2018, down 26 per cent from the same period in 2016, the year when new licenses peaked.

Earlier this month, S&P Global Ratings cut the credit worthiness of two local companies, Dubai Electricity and Water Authority to BBB from BBB-plus and DIFC Investments to BBB-minus one-step above junk status, from BBB, citing the weakening economy of Dubai. Thus, downgrade has added more pressure on the economy as Dubai does not have a separate sovereign rating like its neighboring emirate Abu Dhabi, the credit rating of its state owned companies is often perceived as an indicator for the economy.

Official data shows Dubai's population continued to expand by 3.5 per cent to 3.08 million in the first half of 2018. However, most of the growth in recent years has been in lower-paid construction and services jobs, rather than in higher-paid white-collar posts. It is currently uncertain whether Dubai’s transportation industry and economic zones will be able to grow fast enough to attract and retain foreign white-collar workers needed to support the demand for its real estate market.

Dubai has been facing unprecedented competition from neighboring countries for capital, as low oil prices forced those countries to develop their own non-oil industries. Portfolio funds are already flowing from Dubai's stock market to Saudi Arabia's bourse. A recent Reuters poll shows that Middle East fund managers intend to allocate more money into Saudi Arabian equities while decreasing their exposures to UAE. The fund flows into Saudi Arabia have come partly at the expense of other markets in the region, particularly those in the United Arab Emirates.

A major factor contributing to the fall in the real estate prices stem from the fact that the upfront costs of purchasing a property in Dubai precludes many from buying. Dubai has a mortgage cap in place, which means that a buyer purchasing a property valued at Dh5 million or less needs approximately a third of the property value in cash.

<strong>Road Ahead for Dubai</strong>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects Dubai’s economy to gradually recover as the government accelerates spending in preparation for the Expo 2020 event and estimate the gross domestic product to expand over 3% in 2019.

<strong>Growth forecast by the IMF remains Optimistic</strong>

<span style="color: #808080; font-size: 10px;">Source: IMF</span>

The Expo 2020 event in Dubai could drive up GDP growth by 2 percentage points between 2020 and 2021 by boosting job creation, consumption, and tourism. However, it must be kept in mind that much of the growth seen in 2018 is due to a big rise in state spending as Dubai builds infrastructure to host the Expo 2020 world's fair. The 2018 budget rose to a record 56.6 billion dirhams (USD 15.4 billion), a 19.5 per cent rise from 2017 levels. It is unfeasible to imagine that the government can keep boosting its expenditure at this speed indefinitely.

Recent structural reforms, including plans to introduce long-term expatriate visas for up to 10 years, could help to boost the UAE’s population and consumer demand. The new UAE long-term and temporary visa system should facilitate retention of white-collar expatriates, which may increase expatriate incentives to acquire property and support real estate demand.

Potentially the most far-reaching reform was recently announced by the UAE cabinet, which would allow 100 per cent foreign ownership of some UAE-based businesses, up from the current 49 per cent limit. However, details of the new policy have not been released yet, and implementing it may be tricky. The existing free zones in Dubai already permit 100 per cent foreign ownership which could suffer if they no longer have this right exclusively.

The UAE cabinet approved plans in June for the insurance scheme to replace the previous system whereby employers had to provide a monetary guarantee to cover each of their workforce. The new UAE-wide insurance scheme may provide a one-time boost to corporate profits. The move is likely to free up capital that companies could choose to reinvest which could lead to a one-off 0.1 percentage point boost to UAE non-hydrocarbon real GDP growth (Bank of America Merrill Lynch).

The new Federal Government debt law lays the foundations for the development of a bond market in dirham denomination in the UAE. This is important as it will create deeper, more resilient financial markets, benchmark the yield curve, provide more diversified sources of financing, mobilise additional domestic savings and attract capital inflow.

		<Title>[:en]Brutal October - $5 trillion wealth wiped away from global equity and bond markets[:ar]أكتوبر القاسي - مسح ثروات بقيمة 5 تريليون دولار من أسواق الأسهم والسندات العالمية[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">
<div style="text-align: left;">
<blockquote>According to our recently released Monthly Market Review for the month of October, GCC equity markets remained flat thanks to Qatar’s positive performance, while global equity and bond markets shed nearly USD 5 trillion in wealth during the period. Qatar was the best performing GCC market during the month, gaining 5.0% despite the ongoing selloff in emerging market equities. Qatar’s main equity index was also the only main GCC equity index to witness positive returns for October.</blockquote>
Kuwait extended its losing streak for the third month running, declining by 1.7% in October. However, the YTD returns remain positive at 7.0% buoyed by the FTSE emerging market inclusion. All of Kuwait’s blue chip companies were negative with Zain Telecom sliding 6.3% during the month. Despite losing 6.4% during October, Boubyan Bank was the best performing blue chip stock in Kuwait for the year, with a YTD return of 26.7%. Liquidity in Kuwait markets fell during the month, with average daily value traded reducing by nearly 25% compared to September after adjusting for the FTSE EM inclusion.

The S&P GCC index was marginally up 0.1% for the month, retaining the overall gains for the year at 9.8%. Qatar’s resilience in overcoming the embargo through progressive economic reforms aided the market’s rebound in 2018, helping it gain 20.9% in YTD 2018 after a lacklustre end to 2017.  The beat down in Dubai stocks continued as Dubai’s DFM General Index extended its losing streak, falling by 1.8% during October and 17.4% in YTD 2018. Abu Dhabi, Bahrain and Oman indices lost 0.7%, 1.8% and 2.7% respectively during the month.

Intermittent volatility was observed in the Saudi markets during October, as geopolitical concerns and heavy foreign selling weighed in on the country’s index. On October 14, the main index plunged by nearly 7% during intraday before recovering about 3.5% at close. Ongoing geopolitical events have weighed in on investor sentiment as Saudi stocks witnessed heavy selling from foreign investors. However, Saudi Arabia’s main index lost only 1.2% during the month, much lesser than its emerging market peers after receiving support from domestic institutions. As the U.S. sanctions on Iran’s crude exports are expected to kick in by November 2018, all eyes remain on Saudi Arabia as the oil markets gear up for a change in dynamics.

Qatar National Bank and Industries Qatar were the top performers among GCC blue chip companies, rising by 10.2% and 9.9% during the month respectively. The strong performance of Industries Qatar was on the back of a solid earnings growth of 62% during Q3 2018. Growth in sales volume and increased prices of petrochemical products compared to the previous year were the key drivers of profit for the company.

<strong>Global Markets: Is the party finally coming to an end?</strong>
Global financial markets have been hit hard in the recent weeks as investors have been in a sell-off mode, following concerns over a slowdown in global growth and rising fed rates. The month of October in specific has been painful for investors, as nearly USD 5 trillion in value has been erased from the equity and bond markets. Worries regarding a trade war, decline in emerging market currencies, rising borrowing costs and bond yields have affected investor confidence severely during the year.

The U.S. Fed is strong on its path of raising interest rates, which has led to the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar (+5.4% YTD). Although the near-term economic outlook remains strong thanks to a buoyant labor market and federal spending increases, growth is expected to dampen somewhat in 2019 and slow more markedly in 2020 as multiple headwinds loom.

Emerging Markets continue to dwindle as the indices have seen a sharp fall throughout the month of October with the MSCI EM Index losing 8.8% during October. It is expected that volatility will remain high as markets digest interest rate changes, trade tensions and the slowing Chinese economy. Investor sentiment in Chinese markets remain jittery due to trade war concerns. The world’s leading emerging market has faced severe wealth erosion as the country’s equity index fell by 7.8% during the month, extending its YTD losses to 21.3%. Brewing uncertainties of the trade war and rising US interest rates cast shadows over China and other developing markets as the world witnesses the longest selloff in emerging market assets since the Global Financial Crisis. Economic activity in Latin America continues to be held back by political and financial instability in key economies such as Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela, while the Middle East and North Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa regions have benefited from higher prices for their key commodity exports.

Crude has been under consistent pressure during the month despite U.S. sanctions on Iranian exports due to come into force in a few weeks. Concerns over falling global demand and oversupply has seen Oil prices tumble by 8.8% in October, its largest monthly decline since July 2016.

<div style="text-align: left;">

<span style="color: #1f497d; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 14.6667px;">This article originally published in <a href="https://www.khaleejtimes.com/increasing-disruption-spells-brighter-future-for-gcc-retail" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Khaleej Times</a>.</span>

The Arabian Gulf or the GCC region’s retail sector has been going through sweeping changes that are not only disrupting the conventional retail but reshaping its future too. In recent times, the mode of retailing in the GCC has gone through substantial changes that was unimaginable a few years back. There are clear signs of transformation in the retail sector in the region. There is increasing scope for e-commerce in the Middle East, with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates establishing the template for sustainable business models that other countries can look to emulate ( Fitch Solutions-Middle East E-commerce 2018).

Over the last decade, e-commerce industry has grown 1500% in the region. In terms of average spending, an online user spent US$300 in the UAE compared to US$90 in Saudi Arabia, US$94 in France and US$1100 in Canada in 2017 (Albawaba-UAE the next E-commerce capital-2018).  However the size of e-commerce in the GCC region is relatively smaller. According to estimates, e-commerce just stood 2% of the total retail sales in the region in 2017 with the UAE taking the lead, followed by Saudi Arabia (The National and MR Raghu MD Marmore MENA Intelligence 2017).
<blockquote>GCC e-commerce market was estimated at US$3.4 Bn in 2015, US$4.8 Bn in 2016, US$6.7 Bn in 2017 (Arabian Gazette- E-commerce Market Value in MENA 2017). Marmore research predicts it to reach US$20 Bn by the end of the decade, i.e 2020. The table below summarizes various predicted values for expected size of the market by 2020/22.</blockquote>
<strong>Table 1: Various Estimates of E-commerce market size in GCC countries 2018</strong>

The ripple effects of digitized commerce will be wide and deep, directly impacting the conventional physical stores (retail industry), employment and the logistics sector. The growing youth population, higher mobile and internet penetration, high disposable income and booming FinTech industry, are expected to propel digital commerce. In the GCC, mobile penetration is recorded at 76% of the total population, and internet connectivity is reaching above 90% of the population in countries such as Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE (GSMA the Mobile Economy 2017).

In the GCC region, 73% of total mobile subscribers are having mobile internet, while smart phone adoption is 72% as on Q2 2017. Additionally, GCC regions top the other Arab countries and MENA in terms of technology adoptions and utilization (Ibid ). In terms of demographics, almost 50% of the population between 26-35 years prefer online transactions in UAE, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Younger population groups tend to have lower internet utilization. Similar is the case for higher and middle-aged population across 3 GCC countries, as shown in chart below.

<strong>E-Commerce Ecosystem</strong>
In 2017, when Amazon acquired Dubai-based online retailer, Souq.com, it changed the rules of the online game forever in the Middle East. According to reports, Amazon paid US$850 Mn for Souq (Tech Crunch-Amazon Completes Acquisation-2017). The acquisition not only established Amazon’s footing in the region but also heated up the e-commerce competition and helped formalize the structure of the sector.

Surprisingly, while more than half of the population is under the age of 25 in the region, (Youth in the GCC-Booz & Co. 2017)  only 15% of businesses in the region have their online presence (Practical E-commerce 2017).  On the demand side, the key reasons for the rise in e-commerce are, namely, ease of shopping, new payments mechanisms, development of FinTech, multiple merchant points, rise of e-wallets and other alternative payment systems (ICT report-E-commerce in Saudi Arabia). Thus there is an increase in consumers’ willingness to use and accept such technology. On the supply side, the wide range of shopping brands to choose from is one of the prime factors driving the e-commerce market. Huge investments, innovation in consumer mobile devices and connectivity, entry of new players, competitive prices, expanding logistics services are the other key factors shaping the e-commerce market in the GCC region.

Culturally, GCC countries are mainly cash-driven. Although mobile and internet penetration is high compared to global standards, the urge to touch and feel the physical product and, to some extent, a mild distrust in online payment mechanism have emerged as challenges before the region’s e-commerce market. In an environment of cultural conservativeness and technology evolution, Middle East is yet to embrace e-commerce on a full scale. The Table above provides the insights into online customers’ psychology.

Although the e-commerce growth in recent times has been phenomenal, complete trust and confidence in the system is yet to develop among the GCC population. In Bahrain, for instance, product search and data collection are among the top online activities, and online shopping is done by less than one-third of internet users. Also, in countries with higher online shopper penetration rates, such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia, the frequency of buying online remains subdued (PN News Wire- GCC B2C commerce market report 2018).
Overall, the key pressing issues before the e-commerce sector are summarised below:
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #003366;">- Prevalence of cash-on-delivery over other payment methods and consumer wariness of safer online payment transactions.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #003366;">- Most of the countries lack a unified address system which, on the one hand, creates challenges for last-mile delivery.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #003366;">- Extensive use of mobile phone to trace customer location (PN News Wire 2018) makes delivery difficult.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #003366;">- Lack of a well-developed unified online payment system.</span></p>
The online payment infrastructure is still in the evolutionary stage in the region and lacks deeper public trust. In Saudi Arabia, for example, about half of the population remains unbanked and card payment penetration is just over 40%. In terms of logistics, most of the online retailers don’t have well established warehouses and the distribution network is still weak (AT Kearney-Getting in on the GCC  E-Commerce Game 2017).

<strong>Strategies to drive e-commerce transactions in the GCC</strong>
Given this background, some of the strategies to improve the ecommerce transactions in the GCC are discussed below:

For consumers in the Middle East and Africa, price-points or promotions (34%) are the most likely factor driving purchasing decisions, followed by brand (24%) (KPMG). This makes personalised messages and product recommendations crucial. Promotions using data-driven marketing and deep learning (a subfield of AI) can be widely used to understand the individual’s shopping wallet. Entry of new players can increase competition and add better quality of customer service and better discounts.

As exhibited in Table 3, a majority of regional customers prefer to check products personally. In such a case retailers may use strategies like providing comprehensive information about the product ingredients, easy returns and satisfaction guarantees. Also, understanding the motivation of shoppers, their behaviour pattern (behavioural targeting) through browsing patterns can improve the services offered by online retailers and make people transact more online.

In order to improve the payment method, online retailers and local banks can leverage new forms such as QR code payment method which would enhance customer convenience. Online retailers providing “bank transfer” option at checkout can offer a dynamic QR code via app that consumers can scan using their mobile banking app and confirm the payment. In China, the ICBC’s (Industrial and Commercial Bank of China) QR code payment is used for all small payment services, thus speeding up the e-commerce payment experience. Such payment methods can also be more secure as the payment information is not carried through the merchant's store network.

Thus the e-commerce platforms can increase the outreach of customers in the region by redesigning the digital solutions that can increase speed, convenience and visibility. In addition, regulatory drivers like cashless societies, financial inclusion, protecting customers and more open banking competition can increase e-commerce transactions in the region. Though the GCC region is a late adopter of e-commerce, regionally tailored solution and strategies like improving the customers’ trust, better logistics, reliable online payment system and increasing competition among the e-commerce players can offer great results.

The Arabian Gulf or the GCC region’s retail sector has been going through sweeping changes that are not only disrupting the conventional retail but reshaping its future too. In recent times, the mode of retailing in the GCC has gone through substantial changes that was unimaginable a few years back. There are clear signs of transformation in the retail sector in the region. There is increasing scope for e-commerce in the Middle East, with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates establishing the template for sustainable business models that other countries can look to emulate ( Fitch Solutions-Middle East E-commerce 2018).

Over the last decade, e-commerce industry has grown 1500% in the region. In terms of average spending, an online user spent US$300 in the UAE compared to US$90 in Saudi Arabia, US$94 in France and US$1100 in Canada in 2017 (Albawaba-UAE the next E-commerce capital-2018).  However the size of e-commerce in the GCC region is relatively smaller. According to estimates, e-commerce just stood 2% of the total retail sales in the region in 2017 with the UAE taking the lead, followed by Saudi Arabia (The National and MR Raghu MD Marmore MENA Intelligence 2017).
<blockquote>GCC e-commerce market was estimated at US$3.4 Bn in 2015, US$4.8 Bn in 2016, US$6.7 Bn in 2017 (Arabian Gazette- E-commerce Market Value in MENA 2017). Marmore research predicts it to reach US$20 Bn by the end of the decade, i.e 2020. The table below summarizes various predicted values for expected size of the market by 2020/22.</blockquote>
<strong>Table 1: Various Estimates of E-commerce market size in GCC countries 2018</strong>

The ripple effects of digitized commerce will be wide and deep, directly impacting the conventional physical stores (retail industry), employment and the logistics sector. The growing youth population, higher mobile and internet penetration, high disposable income and booming FinTech industry, are expected to propel digital commerce. In the GCC, mobile penetration is recorded at 76% of the total population, and internet connectivity is reaching above 90% of the population in countries such as Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE (GSMA the Mobile Economy 2017).

In the GCC region, 73% of total mobile subscribers are having mobile internet, while smart phone adoption is 72% as on Q2 2017. Additionally, GCC regions top the other Arab countries and MENA in terms of technology adoptions and utilization (Ibid ). In terms of demographics, almost 50% of the population between 26-35 years prefer online transactions in UAE, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Younger population groups tend to have lower internet utilization. Similar is the case for higher and middle-aged population across 3 GCC countries, as shown in chart below.

<strong>E-Commerce Ecosystem</strong>
In 2017, when Amazon acquired Dubai-based online retailer, Souq.com, it changed the rules of the online game forever in the Middle East. According to reports, Amazon paid US$850 Mn for Souq (Tech Crunch-Amazon Completes Acquisation-2017). The acquisition not only established Amazon’s footing in the region but also heated up the e-commerce competition and helped formalize the structure of the sector.

Surprisingly, while more than half of the population is under the age of 25 in the region, (Youth in the GCC-Booz &amp; Co. 2017)  only 15% of businesses in the region have their online presence (Practical E-commerce 2017).  On the demand side, the key reasons for the rise in e-commerce are, namely, ease of shopping, new payments mechanisms, development of FinTech, multiple merchant points, rise of e-wallets and other alternative payment systems (ICT report-E-commerce in Saudi Arabia). Thus there is an increase in consumers’ willingness to use and accept such technology. On the supply side, the wide range of shopping brands to choose from is one of the prime factors driving the e-commerce market. Huge investments, innovation in consumer mobile devices and connectivity, entry of new players, competitive prices, expanding logistics services are the other key factors shaping the e-commerce market in the GCC region.

Culturally, GCC countries are mainly cash-driven. Although mobile and internet penetration is high compared to global standards, the urge to touch and feel the physical product and, to some extent, a mild distrust in online payment mechanism have emerged as challenges before the region’s e-commerce market. In an environment of cultural conservativeness and technology evolution, Middle East is yet to embrace e-commerce on a full scale. The Table above provides the insights into online customers’ psychology.

Although the e-commerce growth in recent times has been phenomenal, complete trust and confidence in the system is yet to develop among the GCC population. In Bahrain, for instance, product search and data collection are among the top online activities, and online shopping is done by less than one-third of internet users. Also, in countries with higher online shopper penetration rates, such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia, the frequency of buying online remains subdued (PN News Wire- GCC B2C commerce market report 2018).

J.P. Morgan has recently said that Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar sovereign bonds would be added to its Emerging Market Bond Index (EMBI) from January 2019, a decision that can potentially bring up to USD 60 billion of active and passive inflows, according to analysts. In order to qualify for index membership, the maturity of the debt should be greater than one year with a minimum face value of USD 500 million.

<strong>Low correlation of GCC bonds seen with JPM EMBI </strong>

<span style="color: #808080; font-size: 10px;">Source: Reuters, S&P</span>
<blockquote>The correlation of the S&P GCC Bond Index with that of the JPM EMBI ETF is only 0.38. This suggests that if the GCC countries are added to the JPM EMBI, the overall risk of the index would go down providing a higher risk reward ratio to the investors.</blockquote>
The new countries, which will be included in EMBI Global Diversified (EMBIGD), EMBI Global as well as the EURO-EMBIG series, will represent around 11.2 per cent weightage on the index, with Saudi Arabia taking the maximum of 3.1 per cent, while the UAE will get 2.6 per cent weightage. Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait will get 2.6 per cent, 2.1 per cent and 0.8 per cent weightage, respectively, according to a document put out by J.P. Morgan. Oman was previously included in the index with a weight of 2.6% on May 31, 2018.

The eligible new bonds will be included into the index in a phased manner ending on September 30, 2019, with a proportion of the total exposure included at each month-end.

Not only conventional bonds but also Sukuk (Islamic bonds) from the region will be included in the index provided they are rated. Inclusion in the index will increase the demand for GCC bonds and Sukuk and this bid will assist in spread tightening in the near future.

GCC countries combined have issued a quarter of all new debt sold by emerging markets in each of the last three years. Currently, they account for approximately 14 per cent of total outstanding EM debt stock. The total domestic and USD-denominated debt outstanding from GCC issuers is about USD 317bn. Dollar denominated debt accounts for 68%. While the USD debt issuance from the Middle East has received widespread attention, the local currency market has been growing too.

Saudi Arabia has been the leader in developing a domestic debt market, having reduced its reliance on USD funding to just over 30 per cent of its dollar-denominated debt as percentage of total bonds issued. The UAE, on the other hand, has relied solely on USD issuance. Kuwait’s domestic currency bond market is worth watching, given that only 54 per cent of its funding comes from USD issuance.

<strong>USD denominated debt</strong> <strong>as percentage of total bonds issued</strong>

<span style="color: #808080; font-size: 10px;">Source: Bloomberg as of June 20, 2018.</span>

<span style="color: #8b4513;"><strong>What led to the inclusion?</strong></span>
J.P. Morgan’s decision follows a surge in debt issuance from the Gulf Arab region in the past few years, as low oil prices force most countries to fund part of their state spending in the international debt markets.

GCC index inclusion is a timely recognition of the fact that issuance from the region represents over 14 per cent of the stock of emerging market debt, and provides important diversification benefits. The tailwind resulting from the inclusion headline, coupled with pegged currencies, strong oil prices, relative immunity from trade wars and high credit quality, leads us to the view that the GCC has better value than the rest of the emerging markets.

While the GCC region has, in the past, traded at a tighter credit spread relative to other emerging market peers, the sharp correction in oil prices in 2015 has reversed that relationship, with the GCC region trading with a higher risk premium versus the broader peer group. Current trading levels seem attractive, particularly so given the recovery in energy prices.

<strong>GCC vs. Emerging Market Spreads </strong>(Benchmarked against: 10yr US Treasury)

<span style="color: #808080; font-size: 10px;">Source: Fisch Asset Management</span>

<span style="color: #8b4513;"><strong>How will it benefit the GCC countries?</strong></span>
Including GCC sovereign debt could prove to be a major boost to the region, supporting overall debt issuance. It might also lower funding costs for Gulf-based companies and ultimately lead to higher regional growth. Besides, the inclusion will allow sovereigns to issue debt to a new audience of EM credit-focused investors, which should increase primary demand.

GCC bonds are likely to become more visible to international investors and the inclusion is expected to significantly increase the size of the investible emerging-market universe and allow investors to consider GCC bonds when they want to reduce risk in a flight to quality, potentially reducing the volatility of emerging market bond portfolio flows.

Kuwait and Bahrain should benefit from the EMBI diversified weighting approach, which reduces the weight of the largest issuers relative to their amount outstanding. Flows could reach around 50 per cent of Kuwait's outstanding external bonds. Flows into large issuers such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar will be smaller in percentage-of-debt outstanding terms.

Bahrain will emerge as the biggest beneficiary out of EMBI inclusion. This will provide not only large flows as a per cent of debt outstanding, but is also likely to be crucial for future external financing needs. One of the clear benefits of being a member of a major benchmark is that investors generally have at least some exposure to each country to avoid deviating too much from the benchmark.

Saudi Arabia now has more than USD 68 billion in local currency sovereign bonds outstanding and is among the last sizeable market not to have been added to major fixed income indices. A number of recent developments have improved access to capital markets. With the listing of bonds on Tadawul, prices have become more readily available for about 40 per cent of the Saudi government Sukuk and a quarter of all government debt issued in Saudi Arabian riyal (SAR).

This has increased market transparency and would allow investors to fairly value their bond investments should they wish to invest in domestic local currency bonds. The government also recently announced the appointment of five financial institutions to be the primary dealers in local government securities, which should help improve the liquidity and trading of domestic government bonds.

At a time when market sentiment is turning more cautious, expanding the universe of investible debt markets to higher-rated GCC countries should not only benefit the GCC states looking to deepen and diversify their capital markets, but should also open up new opportunities for global investors. Most investors are aware of the debt issuance from the region, but the demand story may soon be picking up as well.

Some of the sovereign bonds are currently trading at relatively wider spreads compared to their similar-rated peers, on the back of the high level of issuances in recent years and geopolitical risks.

However, the ultimate flow may be lower since many EMBI funds appear to already hold off-benchmark GCC sovereigns in their portfolios. Using a sample of funds suggests an average allocation of nearly 3 per cent already, so flows could be closer to USD 30 billion.

<blockquote>According to our recently released Monthly Market Review for the month of September, GCC equity markets remained flat despite the surge in crude oil prices witnessed during the month. Kuwait stock market, however, hogged the limelight as the first part of its integration into the FTSE EM index was effected on September 24<sup>th</sup>. Consequently, a spike in liquidity was witnessed on September 20<sup>th</sup>, as the rebalancing was done using the closing prices of 20<sup>th</sup> September.</blockquote>
Kuwait stock market was flat during the month and is just about holding on to its yearly gain of 8.8%. Kuwait’s All Share Index, despite its inclusion into the FTSE Emerging Market index fell by 0.1% during the month as the effect of FTSE inclusion was already factored in by investors during the build-up. Among Kuwait’s blue chip companies, Boubyan Bank was the biggest gainer, up by 6.8% during the month while Zain underperformed, with its share price reducing by 0.2%.

The S&P GCC index was up 0.2% for the month, increasing the overall gains for the year to 9.8%. The rebound in Saudi and Dubai markets at the end of the month helped the S&P GCC index close on a positive note for September. Oman and Saudi Arabia’s indices were the best performers of the month rising by 2.8% and 0.65%, respectively. Abu Dhabi was the worst performer, falling by 1.0%. The downgrade in credit ratings of two Dubai based state owned companies by S&P Global in addition to the sluggish real estate sector weighed on Dubai’s equity markets widening its losses before staging a recovery at the end of the month. However, it remains the worst performer so far year to date (YTD), slipping by 15.9%. Qatar remained the best performing GCC equity market in 2018 YTD, despite seeing its General Index falling by 0.7% during September.

Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB) and Boubyan Bank were the top performers among GCC blue chip companies, rising by 12.8% and 6.8% during the month respectively. The announcement regarding a three-way merger involving ADCB to form the fifth largest bank in the GCC enthused investor sentiments, causing the bank’s stock to rise and stand out among UAE blue chip companies which posted negative returns for the month of September. Saudi-based utility company Saudi Electric was the worst performer among blue chip companies, with its stock falling by 11.3% during the month, extending its YTD losses to 23.9%.

<strong>Global headwinds</strong>
The U.S economy is on a strong footing, while many economies globally are having a hard time. The collision of Emerging Markets (EM) and Europe with the American wave of tariffs and policy changes are hurting their growth prospects. A trade war is currently in the making with no sign of backing off from both the China and the U.S, the two largest economies in the world. If the tension escalates and erupts into a full on trade war, there would be no winner and every market could take a hit.

MSCI EM index continued to remain under selling pressure as investor appetite for EM stocks failed to see a trend reversal. MSCI EM index closed 0.8% down. On the other hand, MSCI World index ended the month on a positive note, registering 0.4% gain for the month. Additionally, the financial inadequacies of EM economics largely masked by the global liquidity are starting to appear as the liquidity recedes, following global monetary tightening. EM currencies continue to lose value against the U.S dollar with the currencies of Turkey and Argentina (Turkish Lira YTD -37.4% & Argentine Peso YTD -54.9%) suffering the most.

<strong>Oil Market Review</strong>
Oil markets prolonged their bull run during September in the wake of the U.S. sanctions against Iran, which is expected to put pressure on global oil supply. Brent crude prices surged by 6.9% during the month, closing at USD 82.7 per barrel and gaining  23.7% YTD. OPEC’s production cuts, supply disruptions in Iran, Venezuela and Libya in addition to the rise in global oil demand have contributed to the rebound of oil prices in 2018. In an attempt the keep the prices down, the U.S. president urged oil producing nations during the month to boost their production. However, OPEC leader Saudi Arabia and non-OPEC member Russia ruled out any immediate action while stating that they are prepared to address any potential shortage in output from Iran.

Despite the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China that could cause oil demand to shrink, the outlook for oil prices remain positive primarily due to supply shock expectations. J.P. Morgan in its latest oil market outlook has stated that a spike in prices to USD 90 per barrel is likely in the coming months due to the Iran sanctions. China’s Unipec recently projected the global oil demand to peak at 104.4 million bpd in 2035, up from the current 100 million bpd while also stating that prices between USD 60 and USD 80 per barrel would be normal given the supply and demand dynamics. However, the increase in oil price is putting pressure on consumers in major EMs such as India that imports the vast majority of its crude oil demand.

As a part of their economic diversification strategy, Gulf countries have been increasingly focussing on the expansion of service sectors such as tourism, business, logistics and financial services. The huge stock of fiscal and foreign reserves  in the Arabian Gulf favoured the development of the tourism industry as a core strategy to attract both foreign tourists as well as business travellers.

In 2017, the investment in the Gulf’s travel & tourism sector  was USD 34.3bn that is expected to rise by 5.5% in 2018 (World Travel and Tourism Council, 2018). Such huge investments along with the liberalisation of visa restrictions and easing  of restrictions on foreign land ownership for tourism projects have collectively  enhanced the contribution of the travel & tourism sector in the GDP growth as well as employment generation (the industry’s contribution to the region’s GDP saw an increase of 36% between 2012 and 2017 with an employment of 1,188,000 in 2017) (Ibid ).

The GCC region offers a range of tourism destinations, attracting visitors from all across the world for different purposes such as leisure, business, cultural and religious tourism.

For example, the region’s exclusive cultural villages such as Katara Cultural Village (Qatar), Saadiyat Island Cultural District (Abu Dhabi) and Sharjah Cultural Palace and the 12 UNESCO world heritage sites saw a great influx of cultural tourists.

The world class infrastructure, malls, beaches and multiple leisure attractions have attracted many international leisure tourists. The spending by the international tourists, (Chart 1) both for the business and leisure purposes, has increased considerably over the last five years with an annual growth rate of around 10%.

The UAE tops with the number of international tourist arrivals in 2017, totalling 20.7 million (Statista ). Dubai has also topped the list of global cities with the highest international overnight visitor spend, with total international visitor spending of $29.70 billion in 2017.

The Saudi Arabian city Makkah which receives a high number of religious visitors stood next to Dubai with an annual visitor spend of $18.45 billion (Chart 2).

The GCC governments are also relaxing the norms on visa regulations to increase the tourist arrivals. Saudi Arabia’s 30-day general tourist visa, Oman’s new short stay visas -- ranging from 10 days, one month and one year —are expected to promote tourism and spending in the country.

Qatar has also begun to reform its visa rules, expanding the number of countries it offered visa-free entry to 80 countries and extending the time period of transit visas for passengers wanting to visit the country between flights.

<strong>The changing nature of GCC tourism and new product developments</strong>
. Though the outlook of the GCC’s tourism industry looks positive, there are nevertheless a few challenges which might hamper its further growth.

The improved connectivity through increase in the number of flights(inbound and outbound), especially low cost airlines, intense marketing campaigns and broadening preferences of people to travel have played a greater role in attracting budget travellers and the millennials with limited disposable income.

On the supply side too,  a  number of hotel brands are shifting towards developing mid-range and budget hotels in recent times.

Moreover, there’s a growing trend of business travellers  preferring more and more affordable hotel apartments or short-term lease apartments over high-end hotels or resorts. The increased demand for mid-segment properties in this region  that traditionally favored luxury hospitality has, in the short to medium term, led to a gap between the mid-market and the luxury hotels.

For example, Dubai's luxury to mid-scale hotels ratio is above 50% whereas in cities such as Paris this ratio is between 20-30% (Radisson hotel groups). The high cost of land, lengthy approval process, relatively less financial aid and lending from banks makes such projects less viable for investors (Arabian Business).

Overall, along with the emerging technology, the tourism industry is also undergoing a digital disruption. Travellers now have greater visibility of their choices such as price, performance, availability and satisfaction.
Mobile technology and social media are facilitating more and more customer-brand interaction or customer engagement that is one of the key growth drivers of the hospitality industry.  Dgital marketing strategies, influencer campaigns and promotions are also increasing  customer expectations towards more tailored and customized services.

Additionally, the emergence of sharing economy through  players such as Airbnb is pushing hoteliers to offer competitive prices. ((The peer-to-peer system is expected to bring significant changes in the industry which is also welcomed by tech savvy millennials??)). Further, the implementation of VAT in Saudi Arabia and UAE on January 1, 2018, may also increase the overall cost of hospitality players as well as impact price-conscious travelers.

Other challenges include the  oversupply of rooms which is causing excess pressure on average room rates. Similarly, the increased competition among operators, and the emergence of other competing destinations in Egypt, Jordon, Lebanon and Turkey is also creating further pressure on the sector.

However, going forward, the region is expected to stay firm in the growth trajectory with strong infrastructure spending on tourism-related and other projects and growing popularity of alternative construction methods such as modular construction (3D design printing).

And last, but not the least, the huge boost is coming up from key upcoming events such as Dubai Expo 2020, and Qatar World Cup 2022 would support the sector’s further growth.

		<Title>[:en]Is Debt to GDP Ratio a good explanatory of country risk?[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]The Debt to GDP ratio is often taken as a measure to explain the risk rating associated with the Sovereign rating for that country. In this article we attempt to shed light on other explanatory variables for Sovereign ratings other than Debt to GDP ratio.

Debt to GDP ratio of a country is a very important variable that determines the country’s Sovereign risk rating as it reflects the Country’s ability to service its debt. However, for lower income countries the GDP generated may go towards meeting the essential expenses of living of the population, leaving little surplus for servicing debt. Therefore, in such countries the Debt to GDP ratio must be lower than that for well off countries who have a greater surplus after meeting essential expenditures. Therefore, sovereign rating for developed countries is higher though their Debt to GDP ratio is higher or comparable to that for less developed countries. As an illustration, developed countries like USA, Japan, France, and UK enjoy sovereign ratings between Aaa to A1 (as per Moody’s rating scale) which are several notches higher than ratings of Baa2 to Ba2 for lesser developed BRIC countries like South Africa, Brazil and India. This happens, though these developed countries have Debt to GDP ratios higher or equal to the ratios for these  BRIC nations (The Debt to GDP Ratios for these developed countries are in the range  of 70% to 237% which is equal to or higher than  Debt to GDP ratio range of 56% to 88% for the mentioned BRIC countries).

<strong>Debt to GDP ratio and the respective Sovereign Ratings:</strong>
<img class="alignnone" title="Debt to GDP ratio and the respective Sovereign Ratings" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Debt-to-GDP-Ratio-Marmore-Blog-Fig1.jpg" width="447"/>
<span style="color: #808080; font-size: 10px;">Source: Reuters, IIF</span>

The Wealth to Debt ratio can be another factor that can go in explaining the higher sovereign rating though the Debt to GDP ratio is comparable. The first example is a comparison of rating of UAE at Aa2 which 2 notches is higher than that of Saudi Arabia (A1) though their Debt to GDP ratios are similar around 19%. This maybe because UAE enjoys a higher Wealth to GDP ratio of 8.8 compared to 6.5 for Saudi Arabia. Another example is the comparison between China and South Africa both of whom have Debt to GDP ratios of around 50.5-56.7%, but China has a rating of A1 which is 5 notches higher than rating of Baa3 for South Africa. One of the possible reasons for the rating difference can be wealth to debt ratio for China which is higher at 7.7 while that for South Africa is lower at 3.8.

Greater export revenues prospects and higher current account balance means less likely default by them in the eyes of external investors lending to that economy. This can be another factor that may explain higher rating though the Debt to GDP Ratio is higher on a comparative basis. An example for this case is the rating of Aa3 for Qatar which is 7 notches higher than that of Oman which has a rating of Ba1. Though Qatar and Oman both have a Debt to GDP ratio of 48.4% to 50.9%, Qatar has a current account balance of (+)9.3% while Oman has a negative current account balance of (-) 5.9%.

Lower inflation means stronger currencies leading to better and more certain debt servicing capabilities of countries. Therefore, this factor may be a cause for countries with different debt to gdp ratios but having differences in country risk ratings. For example, Kuwait and Russia are both having debt to GDP ratios that are similar around 14% but Kuwait has a rating of Aa2 which is 7 notches higher than the rating of Russia at Baa3. These two countries have different current account surpluses of 7.0% and 12.8%, but Kuwait has inflation of 0.7% which is lower than inflation of 2.8% for Russia which may explain rating differences between the two countries.

Asides from all the above, other factors exist like political risk, which is very low in developed countries like USA, Capital account surpluses balance current account deficits in some of these countries and cyclicality in economic performance etc. all of which can result in rating differences.[:]]]></Content>

		<Title>[:en]GCC Stock Markets – Kuwait continues to be the best performer[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">
<div style="text-align: left;">

According to recently published Monthly Market Review for the June, GCC markets recovered lost ground during the month, as the positive performance of Saudi equities lifted the broader index. Kuwait continued its positive run in 2019, registering gains for the sixth month in succession. Kuwait’s All Share index rose by 1.9% while its Premier market index rose by 2.3% in June. In the first half of 2019, Kuwait emerged as the best performing market with a gain of 19.1%. The rally in Kuwait’s stocks could be attributed to the positive sentiment surrounding MSCI’s decision regarding the reclassification of Kuwait’s market. On June 25th, MSCI announced its decision to reclassify Kuwait as an emerging market, subject to availability of omnibus account structures and same National Investor Number (NIN) cross trades for international investors before the end of November 2019. Once the final approval is received from MSCI, Kuwaiti stocks are expected to enter MSCI’s emerging market indices on May 2020. MSCI’s announcement to upgrade Kuwait to emerging market status (depending on satisfying certain conditions) is a significant step towards the progression of Kuwait’s equity markets. The move is expected to bring sizeable passive and active fund inflows into the country. Among Kuwait’s Blue Chip companies, Agility and Kuwait Finance House were the top gainers, increasing by 5.3% and 5.0% respectively. Among sectors, Consumer goods index was the top performer in June, increasing by 4.0%.

In the past couple of years, Kuwait’s real estate sector witnessed a slowdown in deals as prices fell amidst low oil prices and weak confidence among investors. However, after a phase of slowdown and consolidation, the real estate activity is picking up in Kuwait. This has translated into higher profitability of real estate companies, thus reversing the declining trend witnessed in the past three quarters.

The S&P GCC composite index gained 2.5% for the month, lifted by the performance of Saudi equities. Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul index led the gains, rising by 3.6%, followed by Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Dubai, which closed 2.6%, 1.9%, 1.8% and 1.5% respectively for the month. Oman and Abu Dhabi indices ended June in the red, losing 1.3% and 0.5% respectively. Saudi Arabia’s index, which witnessed a sharp correction in May due to rising geopolitical tensions, rebounded in June after its successful entry into MSCI’s emerging market indices. According to the IIF, the inclusion is expected to have attracted USD 10.8 billion worth of foreign equity investments into Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul index was the second best performer among GCC markets in the first half of 2019, gaining 12.7% during the year.

Masraf Al Rayan and Saudi British Bank were the top gainers among GCC Blue Chip companies, increasing by 5.5% and 5.4% respectively. Saudi British Bank formally merged with Alawwal Bank during the month to create the third biggest bank in the bank by assets. Saudi British Bank is also the best performer among Saudi Blue Chip companies in the first half of the year, with YTD gains of 24.7%.

Signs were positive in global markets as well, with most markets erasing the losses incurred during the previous month. Next month’s OPEC meeting is expected to have a bearing on the Oil markets, with several members indicating a possible extension of the production cut deal.

		<Title>[:en]Foreign investment in GCC equity markets – Will the inflow levels sustain after index inclusions?[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]GCC countries are in the process of opening their economies to make them more attractive to foreign investors. The inflow of foreign funds through FDI would augur well for diversification of these economies away from oil to reduce their large oil dependence more so because its markets are cyclical and volatile. Attracting investments in non-oil sectors through equity markets is also one of the means to achieve this goal. Foreign equity inflows into GCC capital markets is expected to rise sharply in the coming years, aided by the recent inclusions of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in emerging market indices by global index providers such as MSCI, FTSE and S&P.

The influx of foreign capital into GCC equity markets would contribute to broader development of these markets and may allow domestic companies to raise capital at favorable rates from an enlarged base of investors. This in turn, will lead to higher growth of the private sector in these countries, a major objective of the governments in the region as part of their focus on growth of the non-oil economy.

<strong>Net Foreign Portfolio investment into Equity (USD million)</strong>

<span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #696969; font-size: 10px;">Source: IIF | Note: Non-resident flows are considered foreign flows</span>

According to data from IIF, non-resident flows into GCC equity markets have been sluggish in the past two years, falling from USD 6.7 billion in 2016 to USD 2.2 billion and USD 2.7 billion in 2017 and 2018 respectively. Foreign portfolio investments into Saudi Arabia have been historically low, with 2018 seeing further deterioration due to geopolitical issues in the second half of the year. Saudi Arabia’s markets witnessed an outflow of USD 99 million in 2018, as against an inflow of USD 1.2 billion in 2017.

Saudi markets are expected to buck this trend in the next two years, owing to passive and active inflows from MSCI and FTSE upgrades, raising net foreign inflows to an estimated USD 11.6 billion and USD 13.1 billion in 2019 and 2020 respectively. Similarly, Kuwait markets are also expected to benefit from index inclusions. Net foreign portfolio inflows into Kuwait’s equity markets in 2018 rose to USD 378 million in 2018 from USD 56 million in 2017, as the integration into FTSE EM index took place during the year. Furthermore, the inflows are estimated to progressively rise to USD 676 million and USD 1.9 billion in subsequent years (2019 and 2020) owing to the potential inclusions in MSCI and S&P EM indices. Qatar’s markets were the best performer in terms of price returns as well as net foreign portfolio inflows in 2018. Its inflows amounted to USD 2.2 billion in 2018, up from a net outflow of USD 445 million in 2017. Qatar’s ability to successfully manage the diplomatic isolation of GCC neighbors helped in changing the outlook of global investors on Qatar in 2018. The UAE’s net foreign portfolio inflows have been on the decline since 2016, due to the slump in Dubai’s property market. According to data from the IIF, net foreign portfolio inflows into UAE’s equity market stood at USD 170 million in 2018.

<strong>Classification of major GCC equity markets by Global index providers

<span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #696969; font-size: 10px;">Source: MSCI, FTSE and S&P; Data as of June 30</span>

With several reforms being initiated and upgrades secured from global indices providers, GCC capital markets have attracted the attention of global investors. The flows from foreign investors into the equity markets in recent times look promising. The index inclusions are expected to drive passive and active inflows into Kuwait and Saudi Arabia in coming years, similar to what happened in the case of UAE and Qatar in 2014. The move is expected to have a knock-on effect on the other GCC equity markets as well.

Saudi Arabia, which is the GCC region’s largest stock exchange in terms of market capitalization, has lagged behind its neighbours UAE and Qatar in previous years due to its reluctance to open its market to non-residents. However, Saudi markets have undergone several changes since then, and in 2015 they opened the doors to foreign investors by permitting non-resident institutional investors to invest directly. A string of reforms followed and ultimately led to inclusion of Saudi stocks by FTSE, MSCI and S&P. Further in June 2019, Saudi Arabia relaxed the 49% ownership limit for foreign strategic investors investing in Saudi equities , with a view to expand its institutional investor base and attract funds from foreign investors. Additionally, new rules have been framed to prevent major price fluctuations in stocks after their IPO. Tadawul exchange saw foreign inflows for six consecutive months in 2019, receiving net inflows of approximately USD 10.6 billion in the second quarter of 2019 alone. The first phase of MSCI EM inclusion, which coincided with this period is the primary reason for such huge inflows. Foreign ownership of Saudi equities touched record highs, closing at 7.47% at the end of June 2019, which is a record. Notably, the ownership was 1.4% at the end of Jan 2019.

Kuwait, whose equity market is dominated by banking stocks, decided to lift the foreign ownership limits of local banks in a bid to increase inflows into the equity markets and lower the cost of capital through global participation. The move also bodes well for the potential inclusion of Kuwait into MSCI’s EM index in May 2020, which again is expected to bring sizeable inflows into the country’s equities. In the past one year, Gulf Bank has seen the biggest change, with the total foreign ownership rising from 1.5% in Aug 2018 to 11.5% in July 2019. National Bank of Kuwait, the largest bank in the country by total assets, has the highest foreign ownership among domestic banks at 13.4% as of July 2019.

<strong>Foreign Ownership of Kuwaiti Banks

The next one year is expected to be a busy period for GCC equity markets with the eyes of global emerging market investors focused on the region due to index inclusions. The time is right for GCC countries to push forward with further reforms and sustain the inflow of foreign capital. The role of capital markets does not end with index inclusion. They must ensure that corporate governance standards and disclosures are improved. Stricter regulations need to be enforced to improve transparency for market participants. Steps must be taken to encourage and incentivize more companies to seek listing and not remain as privately companies and family businesses. Capital market authorities must also facilitate listed companies to raise capital easily. To encourage investors, new products must be introduced so that liquidity remains strong, and investor confidence increases. Capital market authority needs to work towards making equity an attractive asset class for domestic investors. All this will ensure that GCC markets’ index inclusions are not merely a flash in the pan, but a progressive step to help in achieving the broader objectives of the GCC governments to increase the inflow of foreign funds into the region for a faster and stable form of economic growth.

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<b>Kuwait’s retail sector</b> is small in absolute terms when compared to regional peers like the UAE or Saudi Arabia. However, Kuwait has one of the highest concentrations of international retailers in the GCC, with the luxury segment proving to be a major draw. The value of Kuwait’s retail market was KD 3.5bn or 9.1% of non-oil GDP, as of February 2018 (Oxford Business Group). These figures are expected to grow even further as consumers have shown an increased preference for international brands and shopping experiences. Several factors have led to the success of the <b>retail sector in Kuwait</b>. As of 2018, Kuwait enjoys one of the highest per capita income in the world at USD 34,244 as compared to the global average of USD 11,297 (World Bank 2018 estimates). Moreover, Kuwait has approximately 45% of the population in the 20 to 39 age brackets, and these young consumers have a high inclination towards retail spending in retail malls, and in the purchase of international brands.

Kuwait’s retail demand remains split between popular community centers, with a focus on food and beverage concepts, as well as larger scale regional shopping centers, which have demonstrated high occupancy rates and stable leasing rates. A new report by the global real estate advisory firm, CBRE indicates that in the second quarter of 2019 there were 702,000 square meters of shopping mall gross leasable area (GLA) in Kuwait, which was categorized as either regional or super regional in scale. The market outlook also reveals buoyant developmental activity across the retail sector with approximately 167,000 square metres of GLA is due between 2020 and 2021. Some of the major retail projects in the pipeline include Tamdeen Development in Al Khairan, Al Manshar renovation, Salhiya Retail Mall in Kuwait City, and a second mall by the Gate Mall Company.

Average mall occupancy levels across existing stock remain strong at 93%, indicating an opportunity for retailer as well as customer-led demand growth moving forward. Regional and super regional retail projects, scheduled to be launched in 2019, are designed to be consistently larger in scale than existing comparable properties with approximately half the operating supply seen to have a GLA of between 10,000 and 40,000 square meters (<a href="https://www.zawya.com/mena/en/business/story/Kuwaits_retail_sector_poised_for_solid_growth-SNG_148602004/">Zawya</a>). The potential introduction of a 5% value-added tax (VAT) from January 2018 has been delayed until 2021 as higher oil prices have eased pressure on the financials of the Kuwaiti government. The delay in the introduction of VAT has been a welcome relief for retailers and consumers alike.

<span style="color: #005596;"><strong>Rise of Hypermarkets</strong></span>
The penetration of large modern grocery stores in Kuwait have historically remained low, as local players like The Sultan Center and Kuwaiti Union of Cooperative Societies, a government union, still hold the majority of the market share through their stand-alone grocery and convenience stores. Although market penetration of modern supermarkets and hypermarkets remains low in Kuwait at 45%, which is the lowest in the GCC, the situation is changing. Over the years private operators like Lulu and Carrefour are steadily expanding their presence in the country. Revenue generation from supermarkets and hypermarkets is predicted to grow at a strong rate.

With the arrival of hypermarket operators, the industry has started to turn more competitive with increased product offerings at competitive prices, thereby compelling local cooperatives to discount their goods so as to attract consumers. However, competitive pricing and increased product offerings are not the only way these modern supermarket and hypermarket chains are attracting Kuwaiti customers. They are also faster at responding to changing consumer demand.  For instance, Kuwaiti supermarket chain Saveco has enjoyed substantial accomplishments, since opening its first store in 2014, targeting locals and mid to high-earning expatriates. Partnering up with global retailers gave the company access to a range of exclusive and health-oriented food products, while its distinctive interior design, has helped to set it apart from local competitors. Moreover, Saveco have also succeeded in engaging effectively with customers online via social media platforms, enabling them to reach a larger customer base.

During the recent period, several large multinational retailers have announced expansion plans in Kuwait.

The internet penetration in Kuwait is one of the highest in the world at 98% as of 2017. This has helped Kuwait’s e-commerce market in expanding rapidly as Kuwaitis and expatriates are shopping online. The value of this subsector was estimated at USD 560Mn in 2014 and is expected to rise to over USD 1bn by the year 2020. There are approximately 2.4mn people actively shopping online in Kuwait, 65% of whom are adults below the age of 40 (Marmore Estimates). Furthermore, Amazon’s acquisition of Dubai-based online retailer Souq.com for USD580 million in July 2017 is expected to have a significant impact on the regional retail market. Kuwait is one of the major markets for Souq, and with Amazon reportedly looking for further regional expansion and acquisitions, Kuwait’s e-commerce market is likely to become competitive.

<strong><span style="color: #005596;">Challenges for the Market</span></strong>
<b>Kuwait retail sector</b> remains challenging due to factors like government regulations, import delays, and limitations to the availability of commercial retail and warehousing space. There are very few good opportunities to open new stores and they tend to be very expensive, especially for hypermarkets. Zoning laws in the country are also strict, something which further squeezes the accessibility of retail space. This often impacts smaller firms the most, making it harder for them to increase market share. Moreover, Kuwait has introduced a rather stringent set of rules and policies for its expatriate population so as to address the rising concern among the local population which can have a negative impact on the retail sector. As a step towards Kuwaitization, the social affairs and labour ministry plans to lower expatriate population from 70% in 2018 to 34% by 2025 (<a href="https://www.arabianbusiness.com/politics-economics/408305-kuwait-considers-reducing-expats-by-15m-in-7-years" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arabian Business - kuwait-considers-reducing-expats-by-15m-in-7-years</a>). Expatriates are increasingly exposed to layoffs, thousands of expatriate contracts being cancelled over the past year. Although there was an increase in total arrivals, the growth was associated with the implementation of new infrastructure and development projects, with the recruitment of blue-collar workers in support of employment figures.

<strong><span style="color: #005596;">Outlook</span></strong>
Euromonitor’s research reported that <b>Kuwait retail market</b> is set to capitalise on the rise of consumerism due to favourable demographics, a rise in population and a strong growth trajectory in tourism and per capita income. The value of non-store retailing is forecast to increase by 48% in Kuwait between 2018 and 2023. The <b>retail sector in Kuwait</b> will attract considerable attention following the rise in international oil prices after several difficult years. With several supermarkets in the pipeline for 2019, there will be ample opportunity for brick-and-mortar retailers to expand business. Competition from hypermarkets is expected to increase over the years to come as consumers increase demand for foreign brands and lifestyle alternatives. As more and more consumers turn towards online shopping, retailers will need to focus more towards these platforms with increased efforts to integrate them into their customer experience models to avoid losing out on a wide customer base. It is expected that these trends will continue aided by stable macroeconomic fundamentals and government infrastructure programmes towards boosting growth and investment.

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]Capital Investment is a harbinger of future growth as the fruits from today’s investments will appear in the future. Saudi Corporate sector has invested large resources in capital expenditure in 2018 which is much higher than their total net income earned during the year. The Corporate sector as represented by 120 (non-financial) listed Companies included in Tadawul All Share Index (TASI) of Saudi Stock Market, was examined to measure change in Property, Plant & Equipment (PPE), gross of depreciation (Capex) and also change in the net income during the last five fiscal years.

<strong>Findings from the Sector Analysis</strong>
The analysis shows that on overall basis, the Saudi Corporate sector has undertaken capital investments larger than tits net income in the year 2017-2018.  The non-financial corporate sector invested USD 22.8 billion in 2018 which was about 5.2% of outstanding gross PPE as of 2018. The sector invested capital assets equivalent to 1.5x the net income generated in the Year.

The Corporate Capex will have GDP benefits not only directly from increase in Corporate Sector output but also spin off benefits from other sectors of the economy such as Banking, Construction, Capital Goods, Steel and Cement, and Consumer sectors that will benefit from the spending on account of distribution of part of the additional output in the form of salaries and wages. Thus, the Corporate Capital spending will drive the government’s efforts to grow the non-oil economy and to diversify the country’s investments and revenues away from oil sector. Saudi Corporate investment in Capital Capex also signals generation of new employment opportunities and a spur to the country’s economic stability and growth.

Directly, the Corporate Capex in 2018 can increase the Corporate sector revenues in the following years i.e. 2019 onwards by USD 8,884 million (by 6.6%) and the sector Net Income by USD 772 million (by 5.1%) if operated at its full utilization, based on the average Revenue-to-Investment and Net Income-to-Investment ratio for the Saudi Corporate Sector during the past 5 years of 2013-2018.

<strong>Industry Groups & their Capital Spending
<img src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Saudi-Corporate-Capital-Spending-Fig1.jpg" alt="Industry Groups & their Capital Spending" /></strong><span style="font-size: 9px;">Source: Reuters & Marmore analysis</span>

A closer look at the Corporate Capital Spending, shows that some of the Industry Groups have invested more than their Net Income for the year while some have invested less than their Net Income.

The groups that invested more than their net income are Utilities (Electricity Generation), industrials (which includes cable manufacturing and airline catering), and energy (that includes petroleum refining, gas stations and transportation of refined products). The higher spending of utilities is explained by the lower income for the sector due to subsidized power which results in comparatively lower net income for a given level of Capital investment, as compared to commercially run sectors like Petrochemicals and Cement. Also, petroleum refineries (energy) is a sector in which investment has to be done in large single block, necessitating capital investment bigger than net income. Also, due to longer life of refining assets, the net income compared to investment is smaller, meaning capital investment must be larger than the net income. The remaining groups i.e. Basic Materials (that includes Petrochemicals, Cement etc.), Telecommunications, Consumer cyclicals (that includes building products, hospitality etc.) and Consumer non-cyclicals (that includes dairy and agriculture products) invested less than their net income. Healthcare had capital spending almost equal to net income. The reason for Capital Investment less than net income for some of these sectors may be due to modular additions in multiple plants owned by petrochemicals, higher net income to assets ratio in the case of consumer cyclicals and consumer non-cyclicals, and modular increases feasible in telecommunications.

<strong>Capital Investment allocation vs Gross Return on Assets</strong>

The CAPEX and Gross ROA sectors are presented in the table below:
<img src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Saudi-Corporate-Capital-Spending-Fig2.jpg" alt="Capital Investment allocation vs Gross Return on Assets" /> <span style="font-size: 9px;">Source: Reuters & Marmore analysis
** numbers in parenthesis are number of companies</span>

In terms of Gross ROA (measured as Net Income divided by Gross PPE), the largest capital spender, which is Utilities that however, had the lowest Gross ROA of 0.7% for the 5 years of 2013-2018. The investment despite the low ROA, may be explained by the strategic nature of these investments as well as their importance for economic growth in other sectors and longer life compared to industries like petrochemicals (Basic Chemicals). Further, power is provided at subsidized rates that results in low Gross ROA for the utilities sector. The next largest capital spending group is Basic Materials (mainly petrochemicals) that had a Gross ROA of 5.4% which is lower compared to other manufacturing assets ranked lower by capex additions. The lower ROA of the petrochemical industry can be attributed to lower benchmark return due to its operation in international markets involving lower cost of capital and higher competition. The third largest capital spender is telecom but it also had a comparatively lower Gross ROA of 6.7% that is again explained by its advantage of assets with longer life and stable returns and constraints from a highly competitive environment. Energy sector was the fourth largest and had a Gross ROA of 0.9% like utilities. Again, the extremely low ROA may be attributed to comparatively longer life for refinery assets, international market with low benchmark cost of capital and as it is a strategic asset for sale of country’s crude oil on value added basis. Lastly, the high investment allocation in these four sectors is to be viewed also from the size of the investment opportunity which is high in the case of all the largest four sectors mentioned, as they are capital intensive in nature.

Low capital-intensive sectors like Consumer Non-Cyclicals and Consumer Cyclicals which structurally do not need large sized investments followed next in the size of capital spending. Consumer non-cyclicals was fifth largest in capital spending and had Gross ROA of 8.8%, followed by Industrials at sixth place that had Gross ROA of 9.2%, and Consumer Cyclicals at seventh place with Gross ROA of 13.2%. Despite the Consumer non-cyclicals and Consumer Cyclicals having showed negative growth for past two years, the capital spending is positive and this indicates a potential uptick in the coming years. Also, though size of Capex was comparatively small, these sectors enjoy higher ROA.

The smallest Capital Spending group which was Healthcare had a Gross ROA of 10.8%. Healthcare sector was last in the size of investments but had a high PPE growth of 12.9% in 2018 that shows expectations of demand growth in future though 2018 did not see revenue growth. The Industrials was sixth in investment size, but PPE growth was again high at 16.0% showing potential in coming years despite fall in revenues in 2018.

On overall basis, the Gross ROA for the Corporate Sector was 4.0% The potential revenue increase as well as the net income increase in future at full utilization by each industry group, estimated based on average ratio of revenue to investment and net income margin for the respective industries is presented as below:

<strong>Conclusion</strong>
All said, Saudi Corporate sector investment in Capital assets during 2018 is encouraging, shows business confidence and bodes well for better corporate revenues followed by profits in the coming year. The Corporate sector through its growth will contribute to the economy’s goals for employment generation and economic diversification. The investments in infrastructure like power would pave the way for better industrial growth planned for the economy. However, it is observed that the incremental returns on investment for the Corporate sector may be low due to low returns for utilities (which has largest share of total investments) based on current business conditions. But then the government is actively pursuing policies for removal of subsidies and therefore the present returns for utilities may not represent future conditions.[:]]]></Content>

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">
<div style="text-align: left;">

Globally, private-equity (PE) firms manage about USD 3 trillion of capital for various investors such as pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and High Net worth Individuals (HNWI). However, less than USD 18bn of that (approximately, 0.6%) is managed by PE firms based in the Middle East region. The minuscule proportion of the Assets under Management (AuM) of the regional PE industry sets clear perspective on the size of PE industry in the region compared with the global level. Recently, the success stories of Souq (acquired by Amazon), Careem and Talabat hogged the limelight and reinvigorated the fortunes of the industry. Big bang announcements in KSA including partnering with Softbank to set up a USD 100bn technology fund and setting up of USD 1bn fund by Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) was welcomed by the industry. However, the encouraging development signs witnessed by the nascent industry has been facing headwinds ever since the Abraaj crisis unfolded.

Abraaj, the Middle East’s biggest private equity firm, was founded in 2002. It rose over the years attracting global investors by offering easy access in hard-to-invest, but fast-growing economies with lucrative investment opportunities such as the Middle East, Asia & Africa. The fund currently manages almost USD 14 billion, which accounts for more than 75% of the regional PE industry managed funds, for various marquee regional and global institutional investors such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation, Britain’s CDC Group and Proparco Group of France.

The group is under scrutiny for allegedly mismanaging money in a USD 1 billion healthcare fund (read more, Abraaj: Stunning Past, Stunted Future). Between October 2016 and April 2017, Abraaj drawdown USD 545 million in three tranches from health care fund’s investors. By the end of September 2017, only USD 266 million of that money, less than half the amount was deployed. The way the fund was handled had led investors to question the internal policies, highlights the deficiency of adequate governance measures and weakness in the control framework, which emphasizes the long persisting regional issue with transparency. Though the need for enhanced disclosures, better governance measures, and robust risk frameworks have been echoed for long in the GCC region, the recent episode involving Abraaj fund has renewed concerns among investors to improve the corporate governance standards in the region.

<strong>Bad corporate governance has been a chronic problem</strong>
The PE industry in the region has been stunted by significant gaps in the region’s legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly in areas of investor protection and corporate governance. Moreover, the still evolving bankruptcy laws make it extremely challenging to deal with positions where the investee companies fail to deliver the expected results. The business landscape in the Middle East region is primarily relationships driven, which does not emphasize the transparency expectations of the global investors.

The regional corporate governance standards remain weak. While regulations do exist for timely disclosures and establishing internal controls, enforcement of the same falls short. Large family groups often dominate non-listed companies and their organizational structures vary widely. They often have family councils in lieu of Board of Directors, comprising of senior family members, to provide direction and strategy for the businesses. Influential Directors often sit across the boards of many companies, leading to interlocked directorships. Families tend to keep their affairs private and are often reluctant to induct independent directors for board positions. Evaluation of board performance is a sensitive issue that could potentially disrupt family ties. Power is concentrated in the hands of select few. Company ownership is closely controlled and senior members of the family often influence decision-making. Centralized decisions are the norm and financial controls could be weak.

<strong>Impact on Fundraising and Deals</strong>
As a fall out of this episode, the founder and CEO of Abraaj, Arif Naqvi stepped down as head of its fund management business and the fund halted further deployment activities. Further, Abraaj suspended fundraising for its latest fund, which already had closed on USD 3 billion of its USD 6 billion target. Since the allegations surfaced in February 2018, private equity deals and fundraising in the region have come to a halt.

Faced with a crisis of confidence among investors, other industry players in the region who intended to raise capital are already feeling the heat as their fund raising plans have either been impacted or abandoned completely. For instance, Waha Capital has abandoned plans to raise a USD 300 million private equity fund. Fundraising activity has come to a grinning halt in the region, with no funds closing in the first four months of the 2018 compared to USD 144 mn raised by six funds during 2017 (Bloomberg). Taking into consideration, the small fragment of fund allocation for the region, the crisis augments the scale of the impact.

Additionally, most of the regional funds that raised capital earlier are yet to fully deploy the same. Presence of high dry powder (funds sought from investor but yet to be invested) could further complicate the deal space, as investors will now be closely watching and paying more attention on how their funds are being handled. According to Preqin, Middle East-based private equity have not been involved in any PE backed buyout deal so far in 2018. The PE transactions had been continuously declining for the last three years as the region’s economy grappled with the impact of low oil prices.

<strong>Way Forward</strong>
The PE firms may now be subject to greater investors’ scrutiny and may have no choice but to oblige with such investors demand. On the other hand, this incident could shake up the industry and could bring in positive changes including better governance, internal control measures, enhanced transparency of operations and better disclosures and reporting standards. Going ahead, we envision greater emphasis on independent boards and corporate oversight to become the norm.

To reassure investors, roles and responsibilities of the board and management should be clearly demarcated. Conflict of interest should be minimized, independence of the board should be exerted and accountability should be firmly established. Emphasis on establishing clear lines of internal control and risk management measures would be welcomed.

		<Title>[:en]Natural Gas over Oil: The Changing Narrative[:ar]الغاز الطبيعي فوق النفط: قصة مختلفة[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">
<div style="text-align: left;">

For several decades, gas sector has been on the backseat largely overshadowed by oil, which commanded a larger market compared to the aggregate of all the other commodity markets.

Natural gas, the least polluting fossil fuel compared to its peers such as coal and oil is set for a major transformation. The commodity's long-term demand is expected to soar in the coming years due to transition towards a low carbon future and growing usage of natural gas specifically in the Asia-Pacific region.

The global energy composition in 2016 was led by oil, which accounted for 31.7% of the total energy consumption demand while gas accounted for close to 21.6% after coal with 28%. However, by 2040, natural gas consumption is expected to account for over a quarter of global energy demand, overtaking coal to become the second-largest fuel in the global mix after oil (IEA).

Within GCC, Saudi Arabia’s domestic gas consumption is growing around 5 percent annually and projected to rise to around 14 billion cubic feet per day by 2025(AGSIW). The GCC’s per capita gas demand is ranked among the highest in the world with Qatar in particular, ranked at fifth. The importance of gas in GCC is fueled by surging demand from the power generation sector, industrial development, and expanding economic activity in recent years. The rapid expansion of the region’s petrochemical sector has also led to a sharp increase in demand for gas as a feedstock. Gulf Arab states have increased their focus on new gas projects to meet rising demand, with Saudi Arabia, UAE and Oman pushing for ambitious development plans. However, the long lead times that is required to bring new gas production online will require much of the demand to be met by increasing imports of gas via pipeline or shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the short term.

<strong>Global Energy Consumption by source, 2040 (New policy scenario) (</strong>It takes account of broad policy commitments and plans that have been announced by countries, including national pledges to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and plans to phase out fossil-energy subsidies.)

Out of total projected demand growth for gas, 80% of the growth is expected to come from developing economies, led by China, India and other countries in Asia. China and India alone are expected to account for half of the 30 per cent increase in global energy demand forecast by 2035 (BP). The concerns related to smog are on the rise and both countries have committed under the Paris climate accord. As a result, coal which still accounts for bulk of the electricity generation in China and India, at about 60 per cent, is expected to be gradually replaced by cleaner fuels such as natural gas and renewables. China, in particular, aims to increase the share of natural gas in its energy consumption basket from 6 per cent to 15 per cent by 2030. This is evident as Chinese Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) imports increased nearly 38 per cent in 2017, compared with the same period in 2016 (Financial Times).

In resource-rich regions, such as Middle East, the case for expanding gas use is relatively straightforward, especially when it can substitute for oil. Among the GCC states, Qatar has the third largest gas reserves in the world. The focus of Qatar’s energy policy is the giant North Field which has recoverable reserves of more than 900 trillion standard cubic feet and a production capacity of 77 million tons per year. Saudi Arabia’s production growth is predominantly driven by the Wasit gas program while the next major project is planned to come online in 2019-20 is the Fadhili gas facility. The UAE is taking a multipronged approach to meet rising demand for gas, with plans to expand domestic production, increase use of renewables and reduce the share of gas in power generation and invest further in LNG import facilities. Oman’s gas industry is set to expand significantly in the medium term as it targets an increase in exports from its LNG complex at Qalhat. Oman has more than doubled its gas production over the past decade and has advanced plans to increase capacity to 165 million cubic meters per day by 2020.

In terms of pre-development resources awaiting investment decisions, natural gas outweighs oil by staggering 25 per cent (FT). The investments are part of a growing interest in gas, as the general belief is that the clean characteristics of natural gas would allow it to keep growing substituting the consumption of other fossil fuels i.e. oil and coal over time.

<strong>Gas demand in the New Policies Scenario (Billion cubic meters)</strong>

In addition to seeking a bigger role in electricity generation, gas producers also see growth in the industrials, chemicals and transport sectors. In ships, for example, LNG can be used as a cleaner alternative to heavy fuel oil as the maritime industry faces regulatory pressure to reduce emissions. Heavy transport by ships, trucks and buses can’t be electrified and the better low-carbon alternative would be to adopt using LNG as a fuel.

The U.S has also become a net exporter of natural gas in 2017 for the first time since 1957. Additionally, numerous LNG terminals are being brought online and U.S is likely to be vying with Australia and Qatar to be the biggest exporter of LNG by 2022 (EIA).

Irrespective of the growing demand from China, prevailing low prices of natural gas compared to about a decade ago have so far failed to stimulate an extensive growth in gas demand globally. Consumption growth rate of gas instead has slowed down to about 1.4 per cent annually since 2010 from an average of 3 per cent annually during the decade till 2010.

There are two main factors that are restricting the demand growth for natural gas. Firstly, the shift in focus towards alternatives had led to rapid expansion in capacity and consumption of renewable power. The rising wind and solar generation are pushing down the wholesale electricity prices. Second, production of electricity by burning coal still remains much cheaper than generating electricity using gas.

Gas is viewed by many as a bridging fuel between the era of hydrocarbons and renewables in the industry. The major risk arising from the advancement in battery technology that enables excess storage of wind and solar power for future use could mean a scenario wherein world bypasses the transition phase of gas becoming the main source of fuel and directly jump to a phase where renewables dominate the fuel mix.

Despite the hindrances, the demand growth for gas is expected to out-perform other fossil fuels in the near future. Going forward, as gas emits only half as much carbon dioxide in electricity generation as compared with coal, and at least 75 per cent less nitrogen oxide and other health-harming particles, gas could well prove to be the a potential ally in the fight against climate change.

The U.S has also become a net exporter of natural gas in 2017 for the first time since 1957. Additionally, numerous LNG terminals are being brought online and U.S is likely to be vying with Australia and Qatar to be the biggest exporter of LNG by 2022 (EIA).

Irrespective of the growing demand from China, prevailing low prices of natural gas compared to about a decade ago have so far failed to stimulate an extensive growth in gas demand globally. Consumption growth rate of gas instead has slowed down to about 1.4 per cent annually since 2010 from an average of 3 per cent annually during the decade till 2010.

There are two main factors that are restricting the demand growth for natural gas. Firstly, the shift in focus towards alternatives had led to rapid expansion in capacity and consumption of renewable power. The rising wind and solar generation are pushing down the wholesale electricity prices. Second, production of electricity by burning coal still remains much cheaper than generating electricity using gas.

Gas is viewed by many as a bridging fuel between the era of hydrocarbons and renewables in the industry. The major risk arising from the advancement in battery technology that enables excess storage of wind and solar power for future use could mean a scenario wherein world bypasses the transition phase of gas becoming the main source of fuel and directly jump to a phase where renewables dominate the fuel mix.

Despite the hindrances, the demand growth for gas is expected to out-perform other fossil fuels in the near future. Going forward, as gas emits only half as much carbon dioxide in electricity generation as compared with coal, and at least 75 per cent less nitrogen oxide and other health-harming particles, gas could well prove to be the a potential ally in the fight against climate change.

The GCC SWFs are bestowed with the responsibility to preserve and grow the national wealth for the future generations and simultaneously, facilitate social development, economic diversification and enhancement of the domestic infrastructure. Based on these objectives the SWFs have been successful in devising and executing their investment strategy in the past. However, over the last few years, the regional SWFs have been operating under several challenges such as low interest rates, new normal oil prices, geopolitical shocks and beginning of quantitative tightening. These significant macroeconomic challenges translate into an extremely difficult investment environment, forcing the SWFs to revisit their asset allocation strategies.

<strong>Wider Asset Classes being Considered</strong>
The SWF has grown in sophistication over time as evidenced by the number of asset classes invested. For instance, ADIA which invested in mere three asset classes in 1976 now invests in 12 asset classes as of 2016.

Similarly, the investments by KIA comprised of 33 portfolios and 19 mandates during 1993, which has now increased to 133 portfolios and 36 mandates.

Note (*): Include 6 separate European countries equity mandates, which were subsequently consolidated due to the introduction of the Euro. In addition, 3 country specific bond mandates were merged into one global bond mandate

Further, KIA has focused on portfolio diversification by distributing its investments across countries to increase returns and reduce risks. In 2004, KIA investments were spread across 37 countries of which 10 were emerging nations. In 2017, its investments are allocated across 120 countries of which 81 are emerging nations. It is evident that KIA has been decreasing its exposure to developed economies and has been increasing its allocation in higher growth emerging markets.

<strong>Growing Prominence of Alternative Investments</strong>
Another prominent trend that emerged as a consequence of this challenging environment is flight of capital from traditional safe haven such as Government bonds, towards more risky but higher return generating asset classes such as equities and alternative investments.

Going forward, alternative investments is expected to gain further allocation in portfolios as a preferred asset class for the following reasons. Firstly, the quest for higher returns due to the low interest rate environment will make alternative assets an attractive asset class. Secondly, the pressure to manage fiscal deficit through drawdown from assets would result in liquidation of low return generating liquid assets and retain assets with the possibility to generate higher returns. Thirdly, the SWFs have the advantage of investment size and long-term investment horizon. This presents the SWFs an opportunity to invest in wider range of illiquid alternative investments and earn an additional premium for doing so.

<strong>Drop in Developed Market Exposure</strong>
Another trend that has emerged recently is the growing negative sentiment among SWFs towards U.S assets. According to a survey conducted by Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, sovereign investors planning to underweight U.S. assets in the next 12 months has jumped to 43% in February-2018 compared to 25% in the December-2017 survey. An example to substantiate this survey result would be the ADIA asset allocation policy which permitted up-to 45% of portfolio invested in developed market equities in 2010, was reduced to 42% as of 2016. The possibility of additional rate hikes by U.S Fed and the increased risk of trade wars as a consequence of action by U.S. President Donald Trump to slap tariffs on a variety of imports could have triggered this shift of sentiment.

<strong>Increased Focus on Local Economies</strong>
Partly driven by stagnant economy and Euro Zone debt crisis in developed economies and partly by local factors, such as regional geopolitical tension, SWFs are increasingly focusing their attention on their local markets. SWFs often turn up as financiers for national development programs.

For instance, Kuwaiti government supplemented the existing health care capacity by establishing Kuwait Health Assurance Company in 2015 with an estimated capital of USD 1.1 billion, KIA is expected to hold 24% stake. While in Qatar, Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) brought more than USD 20bn back onshore to cushion the impact of a regional embargo imposed on the Gulf state. QIA deposits were being used to create a “buffer” and provide liquidity in the banking system after capital outflows of more than USD 30bn. QIA is also considering invest in local real estate development Katara and national carrier Qatar Airways as to strategy to support many state organizations.

Similarly, Saudi’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) too has increased its domestic focus with its PIF program. The Program is expected to create new companies, new ecosystems, and develop large-scale infrastructure and real estate projects. By doing so, the new domestic assets are expected to reach 20% of total PIF assets under management by 2020.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>
The asset allocation strategy of the regional SWFs has evolved a long way since its initial days. Moreover, the challenging investment environment has acted as a catalyst for the change in the strategy. In summary, the regional SWFs have moved away from their asset allocation strategy of being predominantly reliant on the overseas markets and more traditional asset classes such as equities and bonds. The SWFs appear to have matured to be more comfortable with taking exposure in risker assets classes such as alterative investment and are also ready to bet on the domestic companies, at the same time complementing the economic diversification agenda.

		<Title>[:en]Securitization platform for Islamic liquidity management[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]This article was originally published in Islamic Finance News (IFN)</a>.

Liquidity management has been one of the major hurdles faced by Islamic banks since inception, owing to the dearth of instruments that help maintain liquidity while complying with Shariah laws. Due to the unavailability of compliant instruments, Islamic banks typically hold a large amount of liquid assets in their balance sheets until maturity and are dependent on their balance sheet assets for liquidity management.

The excess idle cash adds pressure on their profitability when compared to conventional banks. In addition, Islamic banks hold many asset-backed funding contracts, from which they are unable to benefit t from a liquidity perspective.
<blockquote>The introduction of a securitization platform will help ease the pressure on Sukuk and offer investors and banks an alternative that could address some of Sukuk’s shortcomings.</blockquote>
A potential solution to this problem could be the establishment of a securitization platform that would enable Islamic banks to lighten their balance sheets and transfer some of their liquid assets into financial instruments.

The securitization platform provides a means for Islamic banks to provide investors with Shariah compliant certificates in exchange for cash flow.

The solution would also be a flexible and transparent alternative for Islamic banks to increase their working capital. The increase in working capital will allow Islamic banks to fund additional projects while meeting their regulatory liquidity requirements at the same time.

The platform intends to securitize cash generating financial assets into tradable certificates that are then distributed to investors. The assets would be profiled based on parameters ranging from their maturity, risk and nature. They would then be put into different portfolios, for which certificates would be generated and issued to investors. The certificates would be backed by these assets and would be Shariah compliant by nature.

The resultant certificates would possess different maturity profiles that meet investor requirements. The task of acquiring these assets, pooling them together, segregating and converting them into financial instruments and distributing them to investors will be performed by the platform.

Securitization of assets is already prevalent in the Islamic finance industry in the form of Sukuk, which are widely sought after by Islamic asset managers. However, they have a few drawbacks such as a lack of variety, a lack of developed secondary markets and the ‘buy and hold till maturity’ nature of certain instruments. Additionally, a large portion of Islamic banking assets is usually allocated to investments like Murabahah that are short-term in nature and are non-tradable. The introduction of a securitization platform will help ease the pressure on Sukuk and offer investors and banks an alternative that could address some of Sukuk’s shortcomings.[:]]]></Content>

		<Title>[:en]Do GCC Banks have adequate capital buffers?[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]The term liquidity is defined as the banks’ ability to fund rising assets and to meet its obligations on time. Therefore, when banks are unable to perform the primary tasks of funding assets and paying its obligations, it faces liquidity risk. Effective liquidity management is important to promote macro-financial stability. In the GCC countries, fixed exchange rate regimes provide reliable nominal anchors, but when combined with open capital accounts, they result in limited independence of monetary policy. At the same time, high dependence on revenues from the hydrocarbon sector has retained the vulnerability of the region to liquidity swings driven by oil prices. Additionally, this can also affect the implementation of monetary policy by intensifying the credit and asset price cycles. This highlights the importance of a well-defined framework aimed at forecasting liquidity and ensuring timely absorption or injection of liquidity by central banks.

Basel guidelines refer to a broad set of supervisory standards formulated by a group of 27 central banks known as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). The set of agreement by the BCBS, which mainly focuses on the risks to banks and the financial system are called the Basel accord. The purpose of the accord is to ensure that financial institutions have enough capital buffer to meet financial obligations and absorb unexpected losses. In 1988, BCBS introduced capital measurement system called Basel 1 focusing on credit risk and capital & structure of asset risk weights for banks. In 2004, Basel II guidelines were published, as a refined and reformed version of Basel I accord. In 2010, Basel III guidelines were released in response to the financial crisis of 2008 as there was a need to further strengthen the banking system across the globe especially in the developed economics where banks were under-capitalized, over-leveraged and had a greater reliance on short-term funding (Moneycontrol). Under Basel III, a bank's tier 1 and tier 2-capital ratio must be a minimum of 8% of its risk-weighted holdings. The ratios represent high quality sources of capital, which banks and other financial institutions are required to maintain, in order to be hedged against bankruptcy. The minimum capital adequacy ratio, including the capital conservation buffer under Basel III, is 10.5%. (Investopedia)

<strong>GCC Banks Liquidity Ratios (year-end 2018)</strong>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1883" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GCC-Banks-have-adequate-capital-buffers-MMR-MarmoreBlog-Fig1.jpg" alt="GCC Banks Liquidity Ratios (year-end 2018)" width="585" height="243" />
<span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #696969; font-size: 10px;">Source: Reuters; *Includes only listed banks from the GCC region.</span>

Overall, GCC banks are in a good position to meet the enhanced capital requirements as laid down by Basel III. Majority of banks in the GCC have strong capital adequacy ratios with the average ratio for the region at around 15%. Oman and UAE have the highest capital adequacy ratio at 17%. Moreover, the core tier 1 capital of banks from all the gulf countries average at around 14% which is greater than the required 8% under Basel III. GCC banks have also maintained a healthy loan to deposit ratio of approximately 87% as of yearend 2018. In Oman however, we see a loan to deposit ratio of greater than 100% meaning the bank will not have significant reserves available for unexpected contingencies. Growth in lending by Oman's conventional banks have outpaced growth in deposits increasing the average loan to deposit ratio to 114%. This has been predominantly led by a significant slowdown in the growth in deposits after oil revenue began falling in late 2014.

GCC banks largely fund themselves through customer deposits, which are short term in nature, as the proportion of long-term facilities to total funding is limited. However, the liquidity mismatch in GCC’s banking sector liquidity has improved substantially in recent months thanks to a higher average oil prices, sovereign debt issuances and modest loan growth. While improving oil prices have generated higher government revenues, these are still far from fiscal break-even for most GCC governments. Gulf debt markets are not as deep or varied as developed markets, and therefore, domestic banks have a limited choice of liquid instruments that can be used locally (Gulfbusiness). GCC governments have therefore started to tap into international markets, which has supported liquidity conditions in these markets as part of the international debt proceeds were deposited in the banking system. GCC bond and sukuk issuance surged by USD 32bn in Q1 2019, raising outstanding debt in the region to USD 478bn (Saudi Gazette).

Given the significant role of governments in liquidity creation in the GCC region, a strong collaboration with the ministries of finance, including the exchange of information on government cash flows, will be of immense importance in this respect. GCC central banks need to make use of the full range of liquidity management instruments at its disposal in times of liquidity tightening. Instruments require a thorough review to ensure their terms and pricing are well articulated and encourage interbank market participation. Increased reliance on open-market operations will help encourage the development of interbank markets and allow for an active liquidity management on the part of central banks in the region. Moreover, developing liquidity-forecasting tools will be of key importance in adequately assessing the scope, timing and magnitude of liquidity management operations required to deal with potential liquidity risk among banks (IMF).

		<Title>[:en]Liquidity in Islamic banking: Challenges and opportunities[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]This article was originally published in Islamic Finance News (IFN).

Liquidity management has been a key element for banking, be it conventional or Islamic. However, the main difference between the two lies in the tools each of them can use to effectively manage liquidity. Conventional banks have access to instruments such as interbank deposits, repo operations, foreign exchange swaps, T-bills [treasury bills] and commercial papers that are inaccessible to Islamic banks due to their nature of charging interest, which is prohibited by Shariah laws.

Two key challenges that the ,<b>Islamic banking</b> industry has been grappling with in terms of liquidity management are the lack of a developed interbank market for Islamic instruments and the shortage of tradable instruments with low capital risk and predictable returns.

The difference in interpretation of Shariah laws by different jurisdictions makes the development of an international money market very difficult. Some of the commonly used liquidity management instruments are commodity Murabahah and short-term Sukuk Ijarah.

Commodity Murabahah is intended to replicate conventional interbank deposits while short-term Sukuk Ijarah transactions resemble repo operations of conventional banks. The problems with some of these instruments are that they have high transaction costs and their acceptance as Shariah-compliant instruments is still widely debated.

Central banks in the GCC have been mindful of the industry’s significance and have taken efforts to create dedicated instruments. Given the cyclicality of excess liquidity in GCC banks, continued reliance on commodity Murabahah is expected, which amounts to the outsourcing of some cash management responsibilities at Islamic banks to Islamic windows, which have a deeper set of options and more access to international liquidity management instruments.

Considering the growing nature of the <b>Islamic banking</b> landscape, opportunities to introduce innovative methods and instruments to aid the effective management of liquidity are high. One idea that has been explored is the development of a Sukuk-based trading platform that fits with the existing market practices and provides the advantage of reduced costs and better flexibility as compared to traditional practices.

A Mudarabah-based Sukuk product would be another option in which the returns are directly linked to the underlying asset and not any preset interest rate.

Recent developments bode well for the industry in terms of liquidity management. However, these developments are still at their infancy and have a long way to go before they could match the options and flexibility available to conventional banks. As the industry grows, the problem of liquidity will only get bigger as central bank support will become much more expensive for larger institutions.

The establishment of uniform Shariah standards, the introduction of new short and medium-term instruments, and regulatory support would be the key focus areas that need to be addressed going forward to ensure the continual growth of the <i>Islamic banking</i> industry.

GP Solutions DMCC launched KiwiRide in Dubai, the first locally established platform to provide electric scooter sharing using which scooters can be geo-located, used and paid for through the mobile application. Who are the other key players in the GCC ridesharing sector? What is the future of ridesharing services in the region?

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]Customers are increasingly expecting certain advantages when they shop, travel and handle their finances such as digital access, personalization, loyalty tracking and no touch transactions. In a relatively new trend, customers have similar expectations when they dine as well.

Restaurant tech is defined as set of innovative technologies that improve the restaurant business and the experience for customers. AI, blockchain, drone delivery, and robotics are expected to play a larger role in the food industry. With a 77% smart phone penetration in the GCC, the region is witnessing the emergence of a new section of digital customers which has its repercussions across industries. The food and beverages sector, particularly the restaurant and hotel outlets are in high pressure to stay relevant and be profitable.

The GCC foodservice market was valued at USD 23.2 billion in 2017, and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.1% to reach USD 34.3 billion by 2022 (almasahcapital). Major food tech players like Deliveroo, Zomato, UberEats used UAE as a launchpad to reach out to the wider GCC market. Restaurant operators are increasingly adopting technology with a majority believing that restaurant tech is inevitable to stay relevant and gain a competitive edge in the market.

Over the past decade, the manner in which customers get to know of and interact with restaurants have changed drastically. The restaurant market is highly competitive especially in cosmopolitan hubs like Dubai, and the profits are slim. Restaurants that best understand their customers, capitalize on digital technology and analytics, and utilize the opportunity to engage customers in a highly personalized manner, manage to survive and win in the race. Does this translate into increased dining frequency, amount of the bill, and customer loyalty? If done effectively, yes.
<blockquote>Find out more from our latest report: <a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/gcc-restaurant-tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>GCC Restaurant Tech</strong></span></a></blockquote>
In order to be successful, along with high quality menu, food, value for money and ease of access, restaurants should supplement their services with a good dose of digitization. As customers place increasing emphasis on “experience” and “comfort”, how can technology aid restaurants to revamp? Who are the leading names in the GCC restaurant tech sector and what does the market look like?[:]]]></Content>

		<Title>[:en]GCC Bond issuances witness an uptick in H1 2019[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]Bond markets in the GCC witnessed a pick-up in debt issuances during the first half of 2019 after a subdued close in the last two quarters of 2018. The rise in oil prices during the first nine months of 2018 boosted the oil revenues for GCC economies, reducing the need to tap the bond markets. Consequently, Sovereign issuances dried up in the second half of 2018.

Since the start of 2015 (As of 23rd Sep 2019), the UAE and Saudi Arabia have been the most active in terms of bond issuances among GCC countries, accounting for 34.3% and 31.9% of the total issuances by value. Sovereign issuances formed a major part of total debt issued by Saudi Arabia during the period while the case was opposite for the UAE, where Corporate issuances were much larger in value.

<strong>GCC Bond Issuances Q1, 2015 – Q2, 2019 (USD Mn.) </strong>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1883" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GCC-Bond-issuances-MMR-Blog-Oct2019.jpg" alt="GCC Bond Issuances Q1, 2015 – Q2, 2019" width="585" height="243" />
<span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #696969; font-size: 10px;">Source: Reuters; Note: All non-sovereign issuances are considered as corporate issuances</span>

Sovereign issuances in the GCC region surged after 2016, as the fall in oil prices prompted GCC countries to resort to external borrowings for funding their government expenditure. Saudi Arabia leads the GCC countries in terms of sovereign issuance since 2016, raising more than USD 60 billion through international bond issuances. However, Qatar was the major issuer among sovereigns in 2019 so far, raising USD 12 billion dollars through an international issuance in March 2019. Saudi Arabia and Oman were the other sovereign issuers during the year, with the former raising USD 7.5 billion through an international issuance in January and EUR 3 billion through a Eurobond issuance in July while the latter raised USD 3 billion in July. Oman’s sovereign issuance came after Moody’s downgraded the country’s credit rating to junk territory, much like S&P and Fitch, who also downgraded Oman’s rating to junk category earlier.

Corporate issuances witnessed their best quarter since the start of 2015 during Q2 2019 in terms of value of bonds issued, boosted by Saudi Aramco’s maiden bond issuances worth USD 12 billion during April. Notably, Saudi Aramco received orders worth USD 100 billion, highlighting strong investor interest towards the company before its impending IPO. Excluding Saudi Aramco’s issuance, UAE corporates have been the most active issuers during 2019 both in terms of number and value of issuances.

The total outstanding debt in GCC countries as of Q2 2019 stands at USD 501 billion, of which approximately USD 43 billion is scheduled to mature in the second half of 2019 (NBK report). Rollover of maturing debt is likely to result in further issuances during the rest of the year. As oil prices have been volatile throughout 2019 due to demand and supply side shocks, GCC countries, which have proposed expansionary budgets to boost economic growth, are expected to tap the bond markets in the subsequent quarters as well. Saudi Arabia in particular is expected to lead the activity as it plans to raise USD 31.5 billion for the full year of 2019 to fund its expenditure.

		<Title>[:en]How does remittance cost in the GCC stack up?[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]Cost of remittance varies across GCC countries and is dependent both on the source and destination. Based on the average remittance cost across MTOs, it is observed that operators involved in transferring money from Qatar and Saudi Arabia have the highest remittance costs while that of Kuwait and the UAE have the lowest cost. For instance, the average cost of remittance of USD 200 from Qatar to India stands at 3.9% while that of Kuwait to India is 1.9%. Certain bilateral corridors involving Kuwait and the UAE have some of the lowest remittance costs in the world. In spite of having a relatively high remittance cost, both Saudi Arabia’s and Qatar’s remittance costs fall well below the global average cost of 7%. There is significant variation observed even among MTOs as well. In the case of remittance from Qatar to Bangladesh, one operator charges as low as 1.02% while another operators charges 12.42%.

<strong> Bilateral Remittances and costs – GCC outflows to major receivers (USD Mn.)</strong>

<img class="alignnone wp-image-2458 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Remittance-cost-in-the-GCC-Marmoreblog_1.jpg" alt="Bilateral Remittances and costs – GCC outflows to major receivers (USD Mn.)" width="863" height="322" />
<span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #696969; font-size: 10px;">Source: World Bank; Note – Average Remittance cost is for sending USD 200, Average remittance cost is for Q1 2019 & Remittance flow is for 2017 (latest available), N.A. – Not Available</span>

GCC countries have often featured among the biggest remitters in the world over the years, thanks to high demand for foreign labor, competitive wages, restrictions on asset ownership and a nearly tax-free environment. ‘Remittances’ generally refers to money sent from foreign-born individuals in a country to others abroad. The remittance market in the GCC is substantially big with Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait and Qatar contributing to a large part of the global remittance outflows and consistently featuring among the top 10 countries in terms of outflows during the past few years.

Monetary remittances to developing nations has witnessed a sharp rise over the last few years and are now, behind foreign direct investment, the second largest source of external financial flows to developing countries. Ideally, with the increase in remittance volumes and improvements in technology should reduce the remittance costs. However, when compared to the growth in remittance flows, the rate at which remittance costs have reduced has been much slower.

As most migrant workers who remit money back to their home countries belong to the low and middle income group, the cost of remittance becomes a critical component that needs to be taken into consideration. A very high cost of remittance would eat into the amount sent back home and potentially lead to the development of alternative channels or parallel black markets for remittance.

The cost of remittance has two components i.e. the remittance fee and the exchange rate spread and can vary depending on the country to which the transfer is done.  The remittance fee for receiving, processing and paying out the cash transfer is collected from the sender by the sending agent. The exchange rate spread is the difference between the retail foreign exchange rate that the Money Transfer Operator (MTO) charges the sender and the more favourable wholesale foreign exchange rate that the MTO actually pays. The fee and the exchange rates differ based on the MTOs and the banks and lower charges are used as a key factor to attract more senders to use their remittance services.

In 2015, member states of the United Nations decided to adopt policies called Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which aimed to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030. According to the SDG, member countries are expected to work towards reducing the remittance cost to a target of 3% by 2030. However, as of Q1 2019, the average cost of sending USD 200 to Low and Middle Income countries stood at 7%, which is more than double of the SDG target. Regionally, Sub-Saharan Africa, had the highest average cost at 9.3% during the same period.

The South Asian region, which comprises of India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and several other countries had the lowest average remittance cost amongst different regions, at 5.2% as of Q4 2018. Lower remittance costs could be attributed to high volumes, competitiveness among MTOs and the deployment of technology. These countries are among the highest remittance receivers from GCC countries. Similarly, Philippines, which also sees a high inflow from GCC countries had the lowest fees in the East Asia and Pacific Region.

Remittance has been a very profitable business for Exchange companies operating in the GCC region. For instance, based on the cost of remittance and the respective proportion of remittances across different corridors, the revenue generated by exchange companies in Kuwait stood at KD 59.1 mn in 2018, growing from KD 38.3 mn in 2012 at a CAGR of 7.5%. Their Net Profits for 2018 stood at KD 18.4 mn, also growing at a CAGR of 7.5% since 2012. (Central Bank of Kuwait Statistics)

Despite accounting for the variations among different operators and the relatively higher costs in economies like Qatar and Saudi Arabia, the overall remittance charges in the GCC remain in line or much lower than current global levels and the SDG target for 2030. These low charges could potentially add to the attractiveness of the GCC as a destination, which is something that GCC governments have been working upon through the initiation of reforms like permanent residence and long-term visas.[:]]]></Content>

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]This article was originally published in Islamic Finance News (IFN).

Maturity transformation is the primary business of banks and which by definition is the conversion of a bank’s short-term liabilities into longer-term investments through loans and advances. The very nature of a bank’s business model requires them to hold a mix of liquid liabilities with illiquid assets.

While the primary target of banks is to strive for profitability by optimal utilization of available funds, they also have to maintain an adequate amount of liquidity to stay afloat and deal with any unforeseen liquidity demands.

There are certain fundamentals that affect the liquidity of Islamic banks. They lack sufficient money market instruments that can be easily traded and converted to pay off any near-term obligations immediately, unlike conventional banks, which can easily swap long-term securities for liquid assets in the secondary market.

Unanticipated withdrawal requests by depositors also affect a bank’s liquidity position. The risk of rapid and unanticipated withdrawals by customers resulting in a bank run may also leave a bank exposed to liquidity risk.


In many countries worldwide, there are still no formalized mechanisms in place that provide lender of last resort facilities to Islamic banks.

These facilities are typically provided in the form of interest-bearing loans which do not comply with Shariah rules that govern the institutions that offer Islamic financial services unlike conventional banks.

<blockquote>Liquidity entails a cost and therefore will impact profitability. In other words, higher liquidity will mean lower profitability</blockquote>

As Islamic securities are usually less liquid and since Islamic banks do not have the backing of the central bank to bail them out through lender of last resort facilities, it becomes particularly crucial for Islamic banks to actively readjust their liquidity positions as and when there is a mismatch in maturity in financial intermediation in order to avoid any liquidity risk.

Although the IFSB is currently considering lender of last resort facilities, they have yet to materialize.

Liquidity entails a cost and therefore will impact profitability. In other words, higher liquidity will mean lower profitability.

While the excess liquidity lowers the profitability of Islamic banks, the lack of liquidity may cause banks to struggle in times of crisis and hence the need for a delicate balance.

		<Title>[:en]Waste to Energy in the GCC – Moving beyond the cost dynamics[:ar]تحويل النفايات إلى طاقة في دول مجلس التعاون الخليجي - تجاوز ديناميات التكلفة[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">
<div style="text-align: left;">

Waste to Energy (WTE) provides an environmentally sustainable route for waste disposal while carrying the added benefit of producing clean energy. It is high time for the GCC countries to wake up and take note of their Solid Waste Management strategy as rapid urbanization has led to an increasing waste pile up year over year. Per capita waste generation in most GCC countries exceed the global average of 1.2 kg per day with Kuwait being the highest in the GCC with 5.7 kg per day.

<strong>Per Capita waste generation (in kg/person/day)</strong>

Source: Jambeck Research Group report (2015)

Despite these growing concerns, Waste to Energy has not taken off in the GCC yet with investments starting flow in only during the past few years. We analyze the reasons why the governments have taken so long to unearth WTE.

Globally, the value of WTE market is estimated to be USD 28 Billion and expected to reach USD 37 Billion by 2023. WTE technologies based on thermal energy conversion is widely preferred and accounted for approximately 88.2% of total market revenue. Europe is the largest and most sophisticated market for WTE technologies, accounting for 47.6% of the total market. Despite the increase in industrial waste, strict waste management legislation in the EU have been responsible for the growth in Europe’s WTE market.  In the case of other developing economies the key challenge has remained the large up-front cost for implementation and hence the option of low-cost landfilling is widely preferred.

<strong>Share of electricity produced through WTE</strong>
<img src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/wastetoenergy-marmoreblog-fig2.jpg" width="681" height="304" />

Firstly, from the perspective of power generation, the amount of electricity produced through WTE is miniscule as compared to the solid waste utilized for the purpose. In the case of Qatar, currently, 0.37% of its total electricity is produced by WTE plants. Even when we assume that the total annual solid waste produced domestically is converted to electricity, it is estimated to produce only 735 GWh which accounts for 1.78% of the total electricity produced. The power generation capacity through WTE can’t be increased beyond the threshold value since the raw material required for power generation in this case is solid waste, which is in limited supply. This is one of the key shortcomings of WTE when considered as a source for power generation.

Secondly, when viewed from a financial angle, the investment required for WTE technology remains on the higher side. Qatar invested USD 1.7 Billion to complete the Domestic Solid Waste Management Centre. This is huge in comparison to other renewable/ environment friendly power generation technologies like solar. Solar PVs is witnessing a downward trend and in comparison the case looks weaker for WTE to be considered as an energy source.

However, a key dynamic which favors WTE is the limited land availability in the GCC. Excluding Saudi Arabia and Oman, the total land area available in the other countries is only 113,756 km<sup>2</sup> which is three times lesser than the land area of Norway. But in comparison, Norway produces nearly 5 times lesser waste than the 4 countries combined showing the enormity of waste produced in relation to the land availability. Among GCC countries, waste produced by Bahrain and Kuwait are enormous when compared to their land availability. Bahrain and Kuwait produce 1060.9 kg/day/sq.km and 736.2 kg/day/sq. km respectively while their GCC counterparts, Saudi Arabia and Oman produce a mere 2.2 kg/day/sq. km and 5.9 kg/day/sq. km respectively.

Hence, landfill burial would not be a sustainable technique in the long run mainly for countries with limited land availability, especially when rapid urbanization is taking shape in the region and the city scape continues to grow.

Most of the GCC countries are cognizant of the situation and have taken initial steps towards waste management albeit still at a nascent stage. Only Qatar has thus far produced substantial amount of electricity from waste while other GCC countries continue to procrastinate this problem. Nevertheless, investments are beginning to flow in the past few years.

Waste disposal is a problem that has to be tackled with urgency. Leeching due to the landfill is highly hazardous and in most cases irreversible. Electronic and plastic waste is again a matter of deep and growing concern. Governments should take the initiative and involve private players to manage this issue and push the needle before time runs out. Providing subsidy, easy loans and strict regulations could be the measures taken. Investment in new technology and research should also be promoted by governments as pursued in the case of other non-conventional power generation mechanisms such as solar and wind. Countries should move beyond the cost dynamics of WTE and rather emphasize on the socio economic benefits to build on a better and sustainable future.

<div style="text-align: left;">

This article originally published in <a title="AME Info" href="https://ameinfo.com/money/economy/brexit-gcc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AME Info</a>.

The UK’s vote to leave the European Union caused a period of uncertainty both in the financial markets and the political environment. The UK is the fifth largest economy in the world, and the Brexit process will have major economic repercussions. This led to countries and business entities strategizing their activities to respond to Brexit. The prospective cost to UK’s economy and impact of Brexit has brought into prominence its relation with the Gulf countries in the form of prospects for a free trade agreement, a rise in defense spending in Gulf Co-operation Council states and reaffirmed bilateral ties with many GCC countries.

<strong>EU-GCC Trade: Current Scenario</strong>
The EU-GCC cooperation agreement of 1988 provides the framework for economic and political cooperation between the EU and GCC countries. The total goods trade between EU and GCC amounted to €143.7 billion in 2017. The graph below depicts the European Union’s Total Trade with GCC during the period 2007-2017.

<strong>GCC-EU Total Trade, 2007-2017 (Million USD)</strong>

GCC export to EU amounted to €43.8 billion, while GCC imports from EU amounted to €99.8 billion. GCC’s imports from EU in 2017 were predominantly industrial products (91%), such as power generation units.

<img src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Economic-Impact-of-Brexit-on-GCC_Fig2.jpg" width="681" height="304" />

Only 32% of GCC imports from the UK are in services sector, largely dominated by the health and education sectors. However, in the long term, the growing consumer market in the region is expected to provide worthwhile investment opportunities. The GCC has a young and growing population with high income per capita.

<strong>UK’s Trading Relationship with the GCC</strong>
United Arab Emirates (UAE) conducts significant trade with UK, it is also the largest entry point for goods for the GCC. The UAE is the UK’s biggest export market in the Middle East, fifth largest outside the EU, and twelfth largest globally. During the period 2009 to 2016, UK exports to the UAE increased annually by 6.8%. Top imports from UK include power generating machinery and equipment, electrical equipment, transport equipment and vehicles, precious metals, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment, and food & drink. Exports from the UAE are largely dominated by petroleum based products and then precious metals. Emirates offers 42 flights in a week between UAE and Birmingham, indicating the current state of trade between the two countries.

<strong>Is Brexit the boon for GCC?</strong>
There exists the speculation that EU’s loss will work in favor of GCC countries. Analysts predict that UK’s historically good relations with Gulf countries will be further strengthened by Brexit. Brexit will enable the UK to pursue a more open economic policy. In a noteworthy move, Dubai will permanently host a team from UK Export Finance (UKEF), the British Government’s export credit agency. This would make GCC the fourth international market to have a dedicated UKEF team after Indonesia, Brazil and Turkey. UKEF already financed approximately £2bn ($2.85m) of GCC projects that procured UK exports between April 2016 and April 2017, including notable contributions of $220m in support for Dubai Arena. The UKEF has the capability to provide flexible financing across to support the GCC countries’ diversification plans in the sectors of education, health care, life sciences and creative sciences.
<blockquote>The most immediate and visible impact of the referendum is seen on the valuation of the pound, which fell during June 2017 and is at 1.28 to the dollar. The drop in the value of pound indicates potential British investment offerings especially for GCC.</blockquote>
In the wake of Brexit, British businesses are keenly exploring new markets and talent pools. Dubai is one of the best available options that can facilitate as an entry point in GCC. The Dubai Multi-Commodities Centre (DMCC), one of the world’s leading free zones for commodities trade reports that 66.5 per cent of the firms are considering Dubai as a business destination as part of their international expansion. Geographical location, business-friendly regime, growing marketplace for commodities, financial services and increasing number of specialist industries are the reasons favoring Dubai.

During the period between the announcements of Brexit until February 2018, DMCC saw an increase of 29% in UK companies setting up their business in the free zone. There are over 1350 British companies in the free zone with DMCC hosting 27 percent of SMEs. DMCC reports that out of the UK businesses open to expanding into overseas markets, 40% would consider the Middle East and 75 percent would consider Dubai as prospective location for expansion or relocation.

The GCC region is projected to emerge as the leading business hub in the wake of uncertainties surrounding Brexit. The UK has identified USD 38 billion worth of new opportunities annually for British businesses in different sectors in the GCC region by the year 2021. The GCC governments’ efforts in economic diversification has resulted in the region evolving into a leading business destination. UAE in particular has been a favored place for entrepreneurs and it is estimated that its position will strengthen after Brexit. British businesses are among the top three nationalities in the Free Zone. British American Tobacco, mining group Rio Tinto, Dyson, John West and Deliveroo are a few British companies already present in DMCC.

Brexit presents the prospect of Free Trade Zones becoming more appealing all over the world with Britain itself becoming a hub for economic free zones. In such instance, successful free zones like Dubai are likely to become useful advisors or operators.

Analysts predict that Brexit can strengthen UK’s relations with Saudi Arabia who is also in the path towards its grand Vision 2030 in terms of a free trade deal.

<strong>How did businesses react to Brexit?</strong>
Brexit generated tension across the political and economic spheres with its uncertainty continuing till date. The lack of a clear standpoint has resulted in loss to the GCC region to an extent. A number of British firms have scaled down or ceased their businesses in the Gulf countries due to a projected dim economy as a result of Brexit. ‘7 Days’, owned by Britain’s General Trust and the Daily Mail stopped the 14 year publication of the tabloid in Abu Dhabi and Dubai in December 2016. In February 2017, Killik&Co., the British investment and financial consultancy firm terminated their 10 years of activities in the Gulf region. During the same period, Britain’s biggest construction and infrastructure investment company Balfour Beatty announced the sale of its entire Middle East business for USD 13.68 million to its UAE’s joint venture partner Dutco. Britain’s second biggest construction service firm Carillion that operated in the region for decades entered into compulsory liquidation in the beginning of 2017.

The British currency is predicted to weaken, having an adverse impact on the property market of the Gulf States and resulting in reduced investment from British institutional and individual investors. This is because all GCC countries, with the exception of Kuwait have their currencies pegged to the dollar. Thus a lower Pound Sterling indicates lesser buying power for GCC.

A similar pattern can be noted among the Gulf Arab companies functioning in London. Gulf Finance House, Bahrain’s major Islamic financial institution delisted from the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in 2015 stating the lack of activity in the bank’s Global Depository Receipt (GDR) on the LSE. Dubai Ports (DP) World, the third biggest commercial port operator in the world pulled out of the LSE in 2014, much before the Brexit referendum. However, it is not certain if the impending Brexit was the cause of DP World’s withdrawal. Global brands are transforming their strategies and international business outlook in response to Brexit. Financial firm such as Japan’s Daiwa, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan are increasingly shifting their focus from London to Germany.

Britain’s potential exit from the EU has increased the level of uncertainty that could further dampen global economic growth by delaying capital expenditures and weakening global consumer confidence. For the oil and gas sectors, the impact will be minimal since Britain is responsible for only 1.6% of total global consumption.
The reaction of GCC Sovereign Wealth Funds is noteworthy. The Institute of International Finance (IIF) reports that a significant part of GCC’s Sovereign Wealth Funds could move out of UK to more mature and emerging economies with Brexit becoming a reality. The SWFs of Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, once active buyers in the British property market are slowing down their activities.

<strong>Conclusions</strong>
The GCC has Free Trade Agreements (FTA) with various countries and blocs. In the event of Brexit, the possibility of an FTA between the UK and the GCC is high. The fast-growing Gulf markets are seen as an important outlet for British exports. This gives UK exports a competitive edge and enables them to achieve remarkable gains though its imports from the GCC such as petroleum, petrochemical and aluminum products. Any free trade agreement between the GCC states and UK is expected to double the existing volume of trade amounting to $27 billion. Gulf investments in the UK exceed $140 billion, most of which are focused on real estate. It is also expected that the UAE-British trade will go from $19 billion in 2015 to $33 billion in 2020.
As it is assumed that sterling would devalue, the UK companies and London property prices would become more attractive to institutional and private investors from the Gulf. However, there exists the possibility of largescale intervention of the UK government in such an instance which could diminish foreign and particularly Gulf interest in the UK market.

In order to boost the trade, GCC should lower the restrictions that the British firms face.  The UK-GCC joint working group on trade intends to address these restrictions. However, the group is bound by the EU-GCC common commercial policy which means that the parties cannot action any deals until Britain formally leaves the union, though they continue to develop strategies to enhance UK firms' access to GCC markets.

The UK’s weakening ties with the EU could mean stronger ties with allies around the world including countries in the GCC. Amidst the persisting uncertainties, outlook remains positive for UK-GCC relations. However, this will depend on each country’s policies and economic cooperation when Brexit becomes an official reality.

Saudi New Bankruptcy Law. Saudi Arabia had no single bankruptcy law in place that prescribes procedures for businesses that face financial difficulty. The courts have traditionally refrained from declaring a debtor to be bankrupt until all feasible methods of debt enforcement are exhausted. This brought about a number of problems such as:
<ul class="rdetails_list">
 	<li>No set procedure for collection of debts which leads to settlement of some creditors while others are missed out completely.</li>
 	<li>Closure of viable businesses that may be facing a temporary financial hurdle.</li>
 	<li>Limited or no information on whether the proposed counterparty was insolvent</li>
 	<li>Multiple lawsuits as a result of multiple legal claims</li>
 	<li>Debtors concealing or disposing assets prior to insolvency with the purpose of defeating the creditors.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><a href="https://www.databook.marmoremena.com/saudi-arabia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong> Did You Know? </strong> <span style="color: #800000;">Saudi Arabia is expected to enjoy the highest credit growth at 5.3% in 2020 </span> - <strong>Learn more </strong></span></a></blockquote>

<strong>Explaining the Law </strong>
The new Bankruptcy Law (New Law) was published in the Official Gazette on 23 February 2018 and came into effect in August 2018.The framework of the new Law is based on a more modern Western styled insolvency regime with clear benchmarking process. The law has a wide ambit and applies to individuals, corporations that undertake commercial, professional or for-profit businesses in Saudi Arabia and Non- Saudi investors having assets or carry on commercial, professional or for-profit businesses through a licensed entity in Saudi Arabia.  It also applies to regulated entities such as banks, insurance companies and telecommunications. Consisting of 231 clauses distributed over 17 chapters, the Law primarily addresses three main areas- preventative settlement, financial restructuring and liquidation.

Preventative settlement and financial restructuring intend to forestall liquidation in case of bankruptcy or insolvency. Under preventative settlement, a debtor may request suspension of claims and the Court may grant temporary extension for up to 90 days which can be extended, provided the period of suspension does not exceed 180 days. During the period of suspension, claims against the debtor and enforcement procedures are stayed subject to the following exceptions:
<ul class="rdetails_list">
 	<li>The application for the initiation of the Preventative Settlement Procedure does not have any impact on contracts to which the debtor is a party or accelerate payment liability and any condition to the contrary is void.</li>
 	<li>Contracts to which the debtor is a party remain in full force</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Financial restructuring is another option to save the business. It may be initiated by the debtors, creditors or regulators when the debtor is undergoing financial disturbances. A trustee appointed by the Court will be authorized to supervise the reorganization including reviewing agreements of the company and accordingly terminating them if they do not safeguard the interests of the creditors.</blockquote>
A debtor, creditor or regulator may approach the court to initiate liquidation in the following cases:
<ul class="rdetails_list">
 	<li>The debtor is insolvent or bankrupt</li>
 	<li>The debtor believes that it is financially impossible to continue the business</li>
 	<li>In the case of an application made by a creditor it can satisfy a number of formal requirements, notably that the debt is due and is for a definite amount.</li>
</ul>
This is undertaken by the liquidation trustee which will assume the management of the debtor’s assets. The new Bankruptcy law has special arrangements for the liquidation of small debtors.
The law is slated to improve the Kingdom’s current rank of 168 out of 190 countries in dealing with insolvency. Its notable features are as follows:
<ul class="rdetails_list">
 	<li>It restricts set-offs once preventive settlement and financial reorganization have been commenced.</li>
 	<li>An order of priority of debts has been established which mandates the ‘higher priority debt’ being paid off before the ‘lower priority debt’.</li>
 	<li>Transactions undertaken with the motive to defraud creditors, conceal debtor’s assets or harm creditors and stockholders are prohibited.</li>
 	<li>A Bankruptcy register having public access will be set up in which the provisions of the Law will be recorded.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Will the new Law propel Economic Growth?</strong>
A revision of judicial system was necessary to transform the existing inefficient and uncertain dispute resolution mechanism. The lack of a bankruptcy legislation was a key deterrent to launching businesses and to the local banks in financing business start-ups. According to Capital Economics, the lack of such a law means that the percentage of total bank lending made to small or medium-sized businesses stand at a meagre 2 percent (<a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/analysis-change-saudi-bankruptcy-law-should-give-economy-boost-900396326" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MiddleEastEye</a>). Such businesses in the nascent stages typically tend to lack the scale needed to access capital via the stock market or the wholesale credit markets. Banks also tend to be reluctant to lend owing to the absence of a strong legal framework to seize corporate collateral if a loan turns bad.

Foreign Direct Investment is less than 1 percent of Saudi Arabian GDP as compared to other emerging countries where FDI contributes 2 to 3 percentage of GDP. According to the United Nations report, direct foreign investment into the country fell to $1.4 billion (5.2 billion SAR) in 2017 from $7.4 billion in 2016 (28 billion SAR), marking a 14 year low (World Investment Report, 2018). The chart below depicts the inward flow of foreign direct investment into the Saudi economy over the last decade.

<strong> Inward Foreign Investment (Million Dollars)</strong>

Institute of International Finance reports that the privatization plans of state- owned enterprises, doubling in size of domestic stock market, trading of local currency government bonds on Saudi exchange and the new bankruptcy law would propel growth in the Kingdom’s capital markets. However, at present, Saudi is still majorly dependent on oil with IMF estimating the economy to grow 1.8 percent this year attributing most of the growth to crude oil rebound. It is to be noted that currently, Saudi Arabia is ranked at 92 out of 190 countries in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business list of 2018. Overall, the present legal environment is not hugely compatible to the behavior of the global business community.

In this background, the bankruptcy law emerges as an important factor. It was one of the main things that discouraged or to an extent curbed foreign ownership in Saudi Arabia.  The underlying intention of the law is to develop the business environment in the country, encourage investment and subsequently place Saudi Arabia on the path to good economic growth. The new law will formalize the process of liquidation of companies that faced financial trouble, or grant them the time for recovery. With a strong legal protection in place, entrepreneurs from within and outside GCC would increasingly set up new enterprises. In simple terms, the law provides procedural clarity in dealing bankruptcies which is necessary in instilling confidence especially in budding entrepreneurs, small and medium sized businesses.

Also, the law regulates the value of the debtor’s assets to be sold at the highest possible price in a short time span, ensuring trust in the credit market. Drawing on globally accepted insolvency standards, the new law offers protection to creditors as well as financially troubled companies enabling them to wind up the business affairs in an orderly manner. The law is expected to be welcomed by economists, SMEs and start-ups aiming to invest in KSA as it guarantees them an efficient legal infrastructure to fulfill their obligations and reorganize their finances without fear of asset seizure.

The new bankruptcy law can be placed within a larger framework of structural reforms in the country that would prepare it for Vision 2030. However, there are other interlinked factors that need to be addressed to bring about a wholesome transformation. This includes new laws regarding commercial mortgages and commercial franchising towards which the country is already working. Recent developments such as an online payment system, increased corporate transparency and the introduction of an online system to track property ownership and associate loans indicate that the country is on a right trajectory.

		<Title>[:en]Turkey Crisis: Impact on GCC[:ar]الأزمة التركية: التأثير على مجلس التعاون الخليجي[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">
<div style="text-align: left;">

Turkey has been making headlines these past few weeks due to the massive rate at which the Turkish currency, Lira, has been depreciating against the dollar. The economy is under stress with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) downgrading the growth forecasts from 7.1% in 2017 to 4.4% in 2018 and 4.0% in 2019. Inflation levels are reaching record highs to an annual rate of 15.9 percent in July with the Lira depreciating over 40% against the U.S dollar so far in 2018. The events unfolding in Turkey has an impact on the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region through various channels in the form of bank exposures, bilateral investments, trade and tourism among others. It is important to take a closer look at how this event has impacted one of the closest ally and economic partner of Turkey.

<span style="color: #005596;"><strong>Impact on GCC Banks</strong></span>
Multiple banks in the GCC region have exposures either directly or indirectly through their subsidiaries in Turkey. Amongst the GCC banks, Qatar National Bank (QNB), Commercial Bank of Qatar (CBQ), Burgan Bank, Kuwait Financial House (KFH) and National Commercial Bank (NCB) have all seen a significant impact in their share prices on the back of the lira’s depreciation.

<strong>GCC banking exposure to Turkey
<img title="GCC banking exposure to Turkey" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Turkey-Crisis-Impact-on-GCC_Marmore-Blog-Fig1.jpg" alt="GCC banking exposure to Turkey" /></strong>
<em>Source: Reuters, Data as of Aug 21</em>

QNB owns Turkish lender Finansbank, the fifth-largest privately owned bank by assets in Turkey, which it bought for €2.7 billion 2016 from National Bank of Greece. About 15 per cent of QNB's assets and 13 per cent of its loans are linked to Turkey. CBQ, Qatar’s third largest bank by assets, owns Turkey’s Alternatifbank, has been deploying more capital and focus on its Turkey business in a bid to benefit from closer political ties between the two countries  (Reuters). KFH, Kuwait’s second-biggest lender by assets has a sizeable business in Turkey with over 400 branches and has nearly 6,000 employees. Saudi Arabia’s National Commercial Bank (NCB) acquired a 67.03 percent stake in Turkiye Finansbank for $1.08 billion in 2007. Türkiye Finansbank has total assets of $5.6 billion.
<blockquote>As for the earnings impact, Turkish operations account for 19 per cent, 18 per cent and 14 per cent when it comes to KFH, Burgan Bank and QNB, respectively. It also contributes a sizable portion to CBQ and NCB amounting to 8 per cent for both the banks. KHF has the highest loan exposure to Turkey, nearly 30 per cent, followed by Burgan Bank, QNB and NCB with 20 per cent, 15 per cent and 12 per cent respectively. (Reuters, Shuaa capital)</blockquote>
Dubai’s biggest lender Emirates NBD agreed to buy Turkey’s Denizbank from Russia’s state-owned Sberbank for $3.2 billion with an aim to increase its outreach in the Middle East, North Africa and Turkey. The sharp fall in the Turkish lira since the announcement of the deal in May 2018, could trigger an adverse change in the clause creating the possibility for a renegotiation of the deal and a reduction of the acquisition price by as much as 25-30%. (Reuters)

<span style="color: #005596;"><strong>Impact on Trade</strong></span>
Over the past decade, Turkey and the GCC states have actively pursued closer economic ties that has taken their trade volume from $4.8 billion in 2006 to around $16 billion in 2016, a more than threefold increase.

<strong>Turkey-GCC bilateral trade (in USD)</strong>

<em>Source: Based on data from the Turkish Statistical Institute, November 2017</em>

The Turkish crisis has not caused any major damages to the GCC region when it comes to trade. GCC imports and exports from Turkey account for just 2% and 1.4% of its overall trade volume respectively. Turkey too has a modest level of trade with the various GCC countries, with exports and imports of 7 per cent and 3 per cent respectively. However, Turkey is a key destination for non-oil exports for the GCC region where UAE was the 13th largest source of imports into Turkey last year.

The main exports for the GCC countries to Turkey include consumer goods, intermediate goods, fuels, precious metals, plastic, rubber and chemicals and the major imports are Consumer goods, Glass, Metals, Capital goods, Machinery, Electronics, Textiles and Clothing. (World Bank). Overall, we do not expect to see any major impact on the trading volume between the two regions due to the limited trading activity.

Turkey imports oil majorly from Iraq, Iran and Russia which together account for over 80%. Among GCC countries, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia oil exports accounted for 10% and 8.5% of Turkish oil imports, respectively.

<span style="color: #005596;"><strong>Impact on Tourism</strong></span>
Turkey has been an attractive tourist destination for travelers from the GCC region due to its weather, presence of historic monuments and deep religious & cultural bonds. The number of tourist arrivals from the GCC region has increased by over 50% over the past 3 years in 2017 and the continued depreciation of Lira could encourage further tourists arrivals. On the other hand, the tourism industry of the GCC region would not be impacted, as people from Turkey do not constitute the main source of tourists.

<span style="color: #005596;"><strong>Impact on Real Estate Investments</strong></span>
Gulf investors have been active in Turkey’s real estate market for a long time now. Acting as the gateway between Asia and Europe, Turkey has been successfully attracting Gulf nationals to its real estate sector. In 2012, Turkey changed the law to facilitate property investments by Gulf nationals, allowing them to buy properties by passports only and offering a one-year residency permit to foreign investors and their families. Other incentive introduced by the Turkish government includes the golden visa scheme. The government announced that it would grant citizenship to foreigners who buy property worth at least $1 million and invest a minimum of $2 million, or deposit at least $3 million in a bank account for more than three years.

Istanbul and Mediterranean coastal cities are popular with GCC investors due to their close links, both geographically and culturally. Over the past two years, GCC citizens have been among the most active participants in Turkey’s real estate market, with Saudis and Kuwaitis ranked 2nd and 3rd in houses sold to foreigners in Turkey in both 2016 and 2017. In fact, GCC citizens have purchased over one-fourth of all properties sold to foreigners in 2017. Kuwaiti foreign direct investments in Turkey are about $2 billion and the real estate sector accounts for 70 percent of the total. (OxGAPS Forum).

However, the continued depreciation of lira against U.S dollar has lowered the value of the investments. In 2018, Turkish Lira has lost approx. 40% of its value to USD implying that homes purchased for USD 1million a year back would now be valued USD 600,000. Though the perceived loss is notional, it exposes the investor to the vagaries of investing in emerging markets. The situation is exacerbated by strengthening dollar and rising interest rates, which generally portend capital outflows from emerging markets such as Turkey. Turkey could continue to face challenges unless policy credibility is restored and measures to boost market confidence are enacted.

Turkey has been making headlines these past few weeks due to the massive rate at which the Turkish currency, Lira, has been depreciating against the dollar. The economy is under stress with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) downgrading the growth forecasts from 7.1% in 2017 to 4.4% in 2018 and 4.0% in 2019. Inflation levels are reaching record highs to an annual rate of 15.9 percent in July with the Lira depreciating over 40% against the U.S dollar so far in 2018. The events unfolding in Turkey has an impact on the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region through various channels in the form of bank exposures, bilateral investments, trade and tourism among others. It is important to take a closer look at how this event has impacted one of the closest ally and economic partner of Turkey.

<span style="color: #005596;"><strong>Impact on GCC Banks</strong></span>
Multiple banks in the GCC region have exposures either directly or indirectly through their subsidiaries in Turkey. Amongst the GCC banks, Qatar National Bank (QNB), Commercial Bank of Qatar (CBQ), Burgan Bank, Kuwait Financial House (KFH) and National Commercial Bank (NCB) have all seen a significant impact in their share prices on the back of the lira’s depreciation.

<strong>GCC banking exposure to Turkey

<em>Source: Reuters, Data as of Aug 21</em>

QNB owns Turkish lender Finansbank, the fifth-largest privately owned bank by assets in Turkey, which it bought for €2.7 billion 2016 from National Bank of Greece. About 15 per cent of QNB's assets and 13 per cent of its loans are linked to Turkey. CBQ, Qatar’s third largest bank by assets, owns Turkey’s Alternatifbank, has been deploying more capital and focus on its Turkey business in a bid to benefit from closer political ties between the two countries  (Reuters). KFH, Kuwait’s second-biggest lender by assets has a sizeable business in Turkey with over 400 branches and has nearly 6,000 employees. Saudi Arabia’s National Commercial Bank (NCB) acquired a 67.03 percent stake in Turkiye Finansbank for $1.08 billion in 2007. Türkiye Finansbank has total assets of $5.6 billion.
<blockquote>As for the earnings impact, Turkish operations account for 19 per cent, 18 per cent and 14 per cent when it comes to KFH, Burgan Bank and QNB, respectively. It also contributes a sizable portion to CBQ and NCB amounting to 8 per cent for both the banks. KHF has the highest loan exposure to Turkey, nearly 30 per cent, followed by Burgan Bank, QNB and NCB with 20 per cent, 15 per cent and 12 per cent respectively. (Reuters, Shuaa capital)</blockquote>
Dubai’s biggest lender Emirates NBD agreed to buy Turkey’s Denizbank from Russia’s state-owned Sberbank for $3.2 billion with an aim to increase its outreach in the Middle East, North Africa and Turkey. The sharp fall in the Turkish lira since the announcement of the deal in May 2018, could trigger an adverse change in the clause creating the possibility for a renegotiation of the deal and a reduction of the acquisition price by as much as 25-30%. (Reuters)

<span style="color: #005596;"><strong>Impact on Trade</strong></span>
Over the past decade, Turkey and the GCC states have actively pursued closer economic ties that has taken their trade volume from $4.8 billion in 2006 to around $16 billion in 2016, a more than threefold increase.

The Turkish crisis has not caused any major damages to the GCC region when it comes to trade. GCC imports and exports from Turkey account for just 2% and 1.4% of its overall trade volume respectively. Turkey too has a modest level of trade with the various GCC countries, with exports and imports of 7 per cent and 3 per cent respectively. However, Turkey is a key destination for non-oil exports for the GCC region where UAE was the 13th largest source of imports into Turkey last year.

The main exports for the GCC countries to Turkey include consumer goods, intermediate goods, fuels, precious metals, plastic, rubber and chemicals and the major imports are Consumer goods, Glass, Metals, Capital goods, Machinery, Electronics, Textiles and Clothing. (World Bank). Overall, we do not expect to see any major impact on the trading volume between the two regions due to the limited trading activity.

Turkey imports oil majorly from Iraq, Iran and Russia which together account for over 80%. Among GCC countries, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia oil exports accounted for 10% and 8.5% of Turkish oil imports, respectively.

<span style="color: #005596;"><strong>Impact on Tourism</strong></span>
Turkey has been an attractive tourist destination for travelers from the GCC region due to its weather, presence of historic monuments and deep religious & cultural bonds. The number of tourist arrivals from the GCC region has increased by over 50% over the past 3 years in 2017 and the continued depreciation of Lira could encourage further tourists arrivals. On the other hand, the tourism industry of the GCC region would not be impacted, as people from Turkey do not constitute the main source of tourists.

<span style="color: #005596;"><strong>Impact on Real Estate Investments</strong></span>
Gulf investors have been active in Turkey’s real estate market for a long time now. Acting as the gateway between Asia and Europe, Turkey has been successfully attracting Gulf nationals to its real estate sector. In 2012, Turkey changed the law to facilitate property investments by Gulf nationals, allowing them to buy properties by passports only and offering a one-year residency permit to foreign investors and their families. Other incentive introduced by the Turkish government includes the golden visa scheme. The government announced that it would grant citizenship to foreigners who buy property worth at least $1 million and invest a minimum of $2 million, or deposit at least $3 million in a bank account for more than three years.

Istanbul and Mediterranean coastal cities are popular with GCC investors due to their close links, both geographically and culturally. Over the past two years, GCC citizens have been among the most active participants in Turkey’s real estate market, with Saudis and Kuwaitis ranked 2nd and 3rd in houses sold to foreigners in Turkey in both 2016 and 2017. In fact, GCC citizens have purchased over one-fourth of all properties sold to foreigners in 2017. Kuwaiti foreign direct investments in Turkey are about $2 billion and the real estate sector accounts for 70 percent of the total. (OxGAPS Forum).

However, the continued depreciation of lira against U.S dollar has lowered the value of the investments. In 2018, Turkish Lira has lost approx. 40% of its value to USD implying that homes purchased for USD 1million a year back would now be valued USD 600,000. Though the perceived loss is notional, it exposes the investor to the vagaries of investing in emerging markets. The situation is exacerbated by strengthening dollar and rising interest rates, which generally portend capital outflows from emerging markets such as Turkey. Turkey could continue to face challenges unless policy credibility is restored and measures to boost market confidence are enacted.

Oman´s economy is known for being highly dependent on export of Oil & Gas as it contributes to 69 percent of its total export. However, over the years, Oman’s export market is witnessing a substantial increase in non-oil exports contribution. Some of the key points addressed in this article are about the recent trends in non-oil Exports, historical data analysis, major contributing partners, and the reasons behind the surge in non-oil Exports.

<strong><u>Exports Overview</u></strong>

<strong>Products</strong>
As per a recent report, the non-oil export value during the year 2017 stood at USD 6,764 million, a surge of 28.2% from USD 5,274million registered in the same period of previous year. A strong and healthy growth was observed in the export of minerals, plastics and rubber, base metals and chemical products, as per the latest monthly statistics released by the National Centre for Statistics and Information (NCSI). Among the non-oil product categories in 2017, exports of mineral products went up by (https://businessgateways.com/news/2018/01/24/Oman-non-oil-exports-soar) 51.5% (USD 1,662 million) & exports of chemical products rose by 41.9% (USD 1,585 million) from the previous year. Again, export revenue from rubber and plastics and basic metals also increased by 43.5% (USD 388 million) and 35.8% (USD 1,228 million), respectively. Oman exports represent 1% of Mineral Oil, fuels and products of World Exports (https://www.trademap.org/Country_SelProductCountry.aspx?nvpm=1|512||||27|||2|1|1|2|1|1|2|1|1). Oman contributes to 0.3% of World Organic Chemicals Exports (cyclic hydrocarbons, polycarboxylic acids, phenols etc).

<strong>Key Partnering Countries</strong>
GCC and Asia are the two largest export markets for Oman. The two regions together make up approximately 79% of Oman’s total non-oil export and re-export market.  At the end of December 2017, drastic growth in non-oil exports to some of its major trading partner countries such as Qatar by (https://www.gulfbase.com/news/oman-s-non-oil-exports-surge/305422) 160.3% to USD 546 million from USD 210 million during the same period in 2016.  Also, the re-exports of non-oil to Iran alone increased by 129.1% (USD 581 million), Pakistan by 70.7% (USD 387 million) and Yemen by 56.1% (USD 301 million). Increase in investment in infrastructure in Iran has led to increase in Oman’s re-exports. Iran has strong dependency on Omani market for construction materials, steel, copper cathode, agro and food products, sweets, chocolates, nuts, fish and shrimp. Again, in Pakistan, with the advent of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the imported inputs are used for the development of transportation networks which contributes towards industrial growth and therefore quality is very crucial. Imported inputs number increased as domestic inputs were either unavailable or of a sub-standard quality.

<strong><u>Growth Contributing Factors</u></strong>

<strong>Increase in Commodity Prices</strong>
A major recovery in energy prices indirectly helped the country to strengthen its non-oil export revenue. Again, prices of several petrochemical products gained immensely gain from a rise in oil prices.
The Sultanate has emerged as leading Global exporter of gypsum for as many as 15 countries primarily in Asia and Africa (https://businessgateways.com/news/2017/11/23/Oman-is-the-worlds-top-gypsum-exporter). Although the Sultanate contributes only 2 per cent of total global gypsum output, it still caters to roughly 20 per cent of the world’s traded gypsum.  Exports for fiscal 2017 are 7.30 million tonnes, up from 5.65 million tonnes achieved a year ago.
<blockquote>Aluminium prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME) touched a three-year peak of USD 2,246 a tonne in December 2017 than that of previous year. There is increase in exports as cost of alumina because of inputs like petroleum coke and coal tar act as cost push factor. Aluminium and its products accounts to 0.4% of its world exports.</blockquote>
<strong>Policy Measures</strong>
In the framework of Oman’s Seventh Five-Year Development Plan (2016-20), the government intends to make big changes by putting non-oil trade on top of its agenda to diversify its economy.

The Sultanate's focus has been to increase non-oil export and to support this ambition they have taken measures such as providing an array of incentives - provision of land at affordable rates, reduction in utility charges and exemptions from taxes have boosted the non-oil production volume thereby increasing the exports number. As a part of the country’s diversification programme, Oman is busy promoting various initiatives & conducting continuous research on courses of action to strengthen its export base of non-oil products, including the mineral sector.

Increased participation of private sector was observed owing to stable economy, wise governmental policies and trading partners’ confidence in the economy. For instance, Customs rolled out at the Port of Sohar an electronic “Bayan,” or “Single Window” customs system to quicken processing.

Ithraa, country’s export promotion agency which is known for conducting market surveys of export markets, also participated in global exhibitions, organised regular B2B meetings to promote Omani products and thereby contributing to the growth of non-oil exports. An annual visit program conducted for Omani manufacturers in order to identify any export problems encountered by companies’ facilitated better movement of goods & payments.

Oman’s trade tariffs are the lowest among the GCC countries, providing inward investors with a low-cost trade environment. Investors enjoyed competitive risk-adjusted return on investment compared globally. The Sultanate ranks in the top 30 countries worldwide in terms of non-tariff trade liberalization and 3rd in GCC; this means investors will face fewer barriers such as quotas, restrictions and licensing issues. For instance, UAE biggest importer of Oman’s fish stated that it finds it cost effective and convenient to transport by land than by other means (https://www.thenational.ae/world/gcc/uae-emerges-as-biggest-importer-of-oman-s-fish-1.669102).

<strong>Conclusion</strong>
This is a positive sign for Oman’s economy as non-oil exports supports as a source of additional revenue, creating a scope for expansion for new economy. As of now, the most demanded export products are from Petrochemical & Mineral industries. However, focus is to diversify it to other segments as well. Trend indicates that non-oil products are mostly demanded by neighbouring Gulf countries owning to lesser transport costs and increase in number of infrastructure development projects. Oman is researching on various ways to raise its non-oil exports, concentrating especially on untapped African markets. The forecast of higher price of oil indicates that the country will look forward to utilize this opportunity to mobilize this additional surplus to fund towards the development of non-oil production industries, as well as channelizing investments in enhanced oil recovery methods.

The advantages of the U.S dollar peg for Saudi Arabia have been multi-fold. It has resulted in stable export revenues, reduced transactions costs and a simple yet disciplined macroeconomic policy. This peg is especially important for Saudi Arabia as despite certain measures to diversify, their economy is dependent on oil and gas and connected activities.

The oil price plunged in mid-2014, and the currency peg has been under pressure since then. The sharp drop in the price of crude oil has brought about abatement in the realized revenues by the world's top oil exporter.

<blockquote><a href="https://www.databook.marmoremena.com/saudi-arabia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong> Did You Know? </strong> <span style="color: #800000;">Saudi Arabia is expected to enjoy the highest credit growth at 5.3% in 2020 </span> - <strong>Learn more </strong></span></a></blockquote>

This has resulted in a downfall of the money influx, driving the government to tap into its domestic balances, and execute an assortment of measures such as reduction of subsidies and introduction of VAT to help make up for the shortfall in revenues and support the domestic currency. The fiscal surplus of SAR 374 bn (2012) deteriorated into a deficit of SAR 362 bn (2015). The government budget followed suit, tumbling from a surplus of USD 88bn in 2012 to a deficit in 2016.

The government’s foreign reserves took toll, resulting in liquidation of about one-third of foreign reserve assets (from May 2014 to 2017). Subsequently, the government tapped into the domestic debt market following which the private sector borrowing took a hit, due to tight liquidity conditions. The bank claims on private sector grew at a much slower rate of 7.7% between 2013-16 as compared to 13.5% in the four year period prior to that. Retail lending was subdued as well. The SAIBOR-LIBOR spread widened from 0.7% in 2013 to 1.032% in 2017. The (bank) deposit growth, which averaged about 12.6% (YoY) from 2011 to 2014, plummeted to just about 1% since 2015 (1.8% in 2015, 0.8% in 2016).

The oil prices rebounded in 2016, and the government deposited more funds in the banks compared to the withdrawals. Following the liquidity shortage in the financial systems, Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) increased the Loan-to-Deposit ratio from 85% to 90%, adding another SAR 35 billion to the local banks. The liquidity conditions further improved when the administration raised additional USD 17.5bn in an international issue of bond. In late 2016, the government settled SAR 40 bn in arrears to the contractors, further alleviating the liquidity crunch.

Cut to 2018, the oil prices have increased; yet, the economic environment in Saudi Arabia is anaemic (see the graph below), due to the decreased private sector lending and the oil revenue, which is expected to increase even more. The U.S Fed rates are on the rise due to the growing confidence in economic expansion, lowering unemployment, weakening dollar, widening fiscal deficit rising national debt and recent reductions in the income tax.

<blockquote>Saudi Arabia has been toiling with rising U.S. rates, trying to balance GDP growth with the impending capital flight. This again, puts immense pressure on the currency peg.</blockquote>
Saudi Arabia raised its repo rate in March 2018, after SAIBOR fell below LIBOR, posing a risk of capital flight. LIBOR soaring above SAIBOR implies dollar denominated investments returns are higher compared to the investments made in Saudi riyal. Capital would be more attractive in the U.S, leading to a phenomenon commonly known as capital flight. Consequently, a scarcity of dollar in the domestic markets will tend to cause depreciation in the domestic currency, eventually leading to depreciation of Saudi riyal. In an attempt to maintain the USD-SAR peg, SAMA would have to sell the U.S dollars from its reserves and buy riyal in the open market – one of the costs associated with currency pegs. It is no surprise that the domestic exchange rate had been facing downward pressure. The domestic repurchase rates were therefore raised ahead of the U.S Fed rate hike. Consequently, the SAIBOR/LIBOR spread has shrunk to 1 basis point from 19 basis points earlier this month. However, the currency peg limitations and illiquid markets mean the gap could widen again, leaving the central bank with some difficult choices.
<br clear="all" /> <strong>3M-SAIBOR, LIBOR spread</strong>

<em>Source: Reuters; ICE</em>

If LIBOR continues to rise, then SAMA has to either:
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
 	<li>raise its repo rate, or</li>
 	<li>restrict liquidity, allowing SAIBOR to climb</li>
</ol>
In an attempt for SAIBOR to overshoot the LIBOR, the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority, has allowed some deposits placed with commercial banks in 2016 to mature without rolling them over. Tapping into the excess liquidity would let the interbank rate take care of the capital flight problem, without furthering the worries of chasing the tail of the interest rate hikes in the United States. Given the expectations of rising oil revenues, curbing some of the excess liquidity is a seemingly easy move for the central bank in an attempt to ease the pressure on the currency peg.

In hindsight, raising rates and/or restricting liquidity have been difficult choices for SAMA due to the economic backdrop in Saudi Arabia. Raising repurchase rates would have impacted the GDP growth while liquidity restrictions would put pressure on the currency peg, causing drainage of the foreign exchange reserves. However, rising oil prices augurs well for SAMA. The foreign exchange reserves have started to replenish (continuous growth for last three months).

The U.S interest rates will be increasing two more times this year. The ability to realise oil and non-oil revenues and the government debt will govern the ability of the SAMA to handle the interbank rates and the resulting liquidity challenges. One thing is certain though - pressures on liquidity and the exchange rate are there to stay this year.

The oil price plunged in mid-2014, and the currency peg has been under pressure since then. The sharp drop in the price of crude oil has brought about abatement in the realized revenues by the world's top oil exporter.

This has resulted in a downfall of the money influx, driving the government to tap into its domestic balances, and execute an assortment of measures such as reduction of subsidies and introduction of VAT to help make up for the shortfall in revenues and support the domestic currency. The fiscal surplus of SAR 374 bn (2012) deteriorated into a deficit of SAR 362 bn (2015). The government budget followed suit, tumbling from a surplus of USD 88bn in 2012 to a deficit in 2016.

The government’s foreign reserves took toll, resulting in liquidation of about one-third of foreign reserve assets (from May 2014 to 2017). Subsequently, the government tapped into the domestic debt market following which the private sector borrowing took a hit, due to tight liquidity conditions. The bank claims on private sector grew at a much slower rate of 7.7% between 2013-16 as compared to 13.5% in the four year period prior to that. Retail lending was subdued as well. The SAIBOR-LIBOR spread widened from 0.7% in 2013 to 1.032% in 2017. The (bank) deposit growth, which averaged about 12.6% (YoY) from 2011 to 2014, plummeted to just about 1% since 2015 (1.8% in 2015, 0.8% in 2016).

The oil prices rebounded in 2016, and the government deposited more funds in the banks compared to the withdrawals. Following the liquidity shortage in the financial systems, Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) increased the Loan-to-Deposit ratio from 85% to 90%, adding another SAR 35 billion to the local banks. The liquidity conditions further improved when the administration raised additional USD 17.5bn in an international issue of bond. In late 2016, the government settled SAR 40 bn in arrears to the contractors, further alleviating the liquidity crunch.

Cut to 2018, the oil prices have increased; yet, the economic environment in Saudi Arabia is anaemic (see the graph below), due to the decreased private sector lending and the oil revenue, which is expected to increase even more. The U.S Fed rates are on the rise due to the growing confidence in economic expansion, lowering unemployment, weakening dollar, widening fiscal deficit rising national debt and recent reductions in the income tax.

<blockquote>Saudi Arabia has been toiling with rising U.S. rates, trying to balance GDP growth with the impending capital flight. This again, puts immense pressure on the currency peg.</blockquote>
Saudi Arabia raised its repo rate in March 2018, after SAIBOR fell below LIBOR, posing a risk of capital flight. LIBOR soaring above SAIBOR implies dollar denominated investments returns are higher compared to the investments made in Saudi riyal. Capital would be more attractive in the U.S, leading to a phenomenon commonly known as capital flight. Consequently, a scarcity of dollar in the domestic markets will tend to cause depreciation in the domestic currency, eventually leading to depreciation of Saudi riyal. In an attempt to maintain the USD-SAR peg, SAMA would have to sell the U.S dollars from its reserves and buy riyal in the open market – one of the costs associated with currency pegs. It is no surprise that the domestic exchange rate had been facing downward pressure. The domestic repurchase rates were therefore raised ahead of the U.S Fed rate hike. Consequently, the SAIBOR/LIBOR spread has shrunk to 1 basis point from 19 basis points earlier this month. However, the currency peg limitations and illiquid markets mean the gap could widen again, leaving the central bank with some difficult choices.

If LIBOR continues to rise, then SAMA has to either:
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
 	<li>raise its repo rate, or</li>
 	<li>restrict liquidity, allowing SAIBOR to climb</li>
</ol>
In an attempt for SAIBOR to overshoot the LIBOR, the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority, has allowed some deposits placed with commercial banks in 2016 to mature without rolling them over. Tapping into the excess liquidity would let the interbank rate take care of the capital flight problem, without furthering the worries of chasing the tail of the interest rate hikes in the United States. Given the expectations of rising oil revenues, curbing some of the excess liquidity is a seemingly easy move for the central bank in an attempt to ease the pressure on the currency peg.

In hindsight, raising rates and/or restricting liquidity have been difficult choices for SAMA due to the economic backdrop in Saudi Arabia. Raising repurchase rates would have impacted the GDP growth while liquidity restrictions would put pressure on the currency peg, causing drainage of the foreign exchange reserves. However, rising oil prices augurs well for SAMA. The foreign exchange reserves have started to replenish (continuous growth for last three months).

The U.S interest rates will be increasing two more times this year. The ability to realise oil and non-oil revenues and the government debt will govern the ability of the SAMA to handle the interbank rates and the resulting liquidity challenges. One thing is certain though - pressures on liquidity and the exchange rate are there to stay this year.

Decrease in oil prices have led the member countries of GCC in search for alternative means of revenue. One way was to introduce a common tax called Value Added Tax (VAT) in the region. On July 09, 2017 two members of GCC, Saudi Arabia and UAE ratified the VAT framework agreement for the introduction of VAT in the region. With a tax rate of 5%, it will be applicable in the entire region with certain goods and services to be treated as zero rated (Zero Rated: The government does not tax sales of goods and services, but allow to claim credit on input tax of those goods.) or VAT exempt. (VAT Exempt: The government does not tax sales of goods and services and also does not allow to claim credit on input tax of those goods.)

With the taxation being implemented on January, 2018 in these two countries, other members are following suit to implement it by 2019. As draft regulations for VAT in Kuwait have not been declared, through this note, we will try to determine the impact of VAT on certain key sectors of Kuwait.

<strong>Transportation & Logistics</strong>
As per the VAT framework, commercial transportation service for passengers and goods from Kuwait to international countries and other GCC countries will be subjected to VAT and will be treated as zero-rated. Kuwait has the option for charging tax on domestic commercial transportation of travelling passengers (which includes air travel and road travel) and goods which if implemented will make them costlier within the country. While it will be easy to implement the tax on the final price of the services provided, overall cost might increase. This may be due to the introduction of tax to fuel prices and other services related to transportation. VAT might have minimum impact on travellers due to small increase in price. As for transportation of goods, price hike will likely increase the price in the supply chain of a company. This will impact profitability and increase the cost of doing business. Due to 0% VAT, inflation will not impact international transportation of passengers and goods. As for domestic services, there is an expected spike in inflation if VAT is levied which is expected to smoothen over time.

<strong>Retail Sector</strong>
This sector will see the biggest impact as VAT would be levied on all consumer goods and products. The stores will be charged an input VAT for which an output VAT will be calculated and included in the final price for the customers. Although easy to implement at store level, factors such as discounts which are given to the customers will have to be considered which might impact the output and input VAT calculation. Implementation of VAT will cost the stores time and resources (like modification in IT systems). With many global retail stores eying for a piece in the growing industry, this might lead to decreasing price margins to offset the impact of VAT in order to attract customers. Customer demand will depend on the price-demand elasticity of the goods. Everyday consumable products which are highly inelastic will face the least impact while there might be a decrease in demand for luxury items. The industry will not be affected by cross border transactions and will be among the biggest revenue source for the government.

<strong>Real Estate</strong>
According to the VAT agreement, Kuwait has the choice of opting for either a 5% or a 0% VAT in both residential as well as commercial properties. In certain projects the implementation of tax can be exempted It can follow the implementation process of both KSA and UAE, where residential properties are exempted or zero rated and commercial properties are taxed at 5% with certain cases being exempt (e.g. NGO, building used for charitable purpose). As such, the owners of commercial properties can charge the VAT to the customers as an addition to their rent, resulting in rental inflation.

Implementation of VAT would impact mostly construction companies and developers. These companies are likely to struggle to implement the taxation, as companies might be unable to claim refund on input VAT related to construction of projects which might be exempted, leading to loss. Moreover, in case of under-progress project, estimating the applicable VAT could be a challenge, if the procurement was done, prior to the implementation and invoices are due until-after VAT implementation. Implementation of VAT might increase the initial cost of constructing the property which will lead to increase in the selling price. Certain companies will want to wait out the entire transition period before starting any new projects so as to avoid confusion of paying VAT while existing projects under construction might be delayed. As for the customers, there might be a temporary decrease in demand for owning as well as renting properties due to increased cost. The industry will not be affected by cross border transactions.

<strong>Financial Services</strong>
Implementation of VAT in the financial sector might be complicated. Firstly, most financial services come as bundled products. Bundled services are the combination of many services into one service. Such products may have both taxable and non-taxable services which might create difficulties to implement VAT (e.g. for portfolio management, managing fee are taxable while margins earned on derivatives is not taxed) (https://www.rsm.global/kuwait/insights/vat-newsletters/vat-newsletter-impact-vat-financial-services) Secondly, certain services taken by financial institutions such as IT services from others will be subjected to VAT, but the same cannot be allocated directly to the cost of financial products. This might lead to loss in terms of not being able to claim full deduction on VAT.

Kuwait might follow the global standards of taxing fee based products (e.g. management fees, commissions) while exempting margin based products (e.g. interest). With lower interest rates, fee based products are becoming more popular among the banks. VAT might slow down the demand of these products with banks having two options to follow. They may either increase the prices of the services, charge them to the customers to have the same level of profit or they may include VAT deduction as part of their spending which might reduce profitability but retain customers. The banks might go with the first option as customers will be willing to pay the extra cost with not much impact in demand. No tax is implemented on cross border services.

<strong>Oil & Gas</strong>
With 50% of Kuwait’s GDP, 95% of exports and 90% of government (https://www.export.gov/article?id=Kuwait-Oil-and-Gas) revenue is contributed by oil, implementation of VAT in this sector will be crucial to the government. The implementation will be standard and will mostly follow the process already existing in UAE and Saudi Arabia. Companies associated with projects like exploration and production of oil and gas, export and oil related services along with products like petrol will come under the VAT purview. Exploration and production along with export will be treated as zero rated under the VAT framework agreement whereas any services and products associated with oil and gas can be subjected to the standard 5% tax slab. This will increase the final fuel prices and companies associated with long term projects will see a significant change in their cash flow. But it is expected to have zero to minimum effect on the consumer demand as oil and gas are seen as a necessary commodity but will definitely increase the cost of living and doing business.

<strong>Information & Telecommunication</strong>
Kuwait has one of the highest mobile penetration rate in the world, reaching 232% in 2015. The country also boasts of the highest ARPU (average revenue per user) within the GCC and will contribute to the tax revenues in a major way with the introduction of VAT. The telecomm market is mainly oligopolistic and is divided among three companies, Zain (market share – 38%), VIVA (market share – 35%) and Ooredoo (market share – 30%). Kuwait can implement the 5% VAT slab on the sector with the tax being implemented for local as well as international services. Following the standard rules of implementation, there will be a price rise and it will affect service providers the most. While this may not affect the consumer demand, there are chances of price wars among the companies in order to retain customers in face of increased cost.

<strong>Automobile</strong>
This industry will see impact on pre as well as post VAT implementation. While VAT implementation will be easy, it will affect the entire supply chain in the industry as well as demand. With pre implementation phase it can be seen that there will be an increase in demand due to low prices. This will come with challenges (increasing working capital constraints, strain to keep up the demand) and opportunities (increased advertising revenue for media houses for ad placement, improvement in supply chain). Post implementation, there will be a decrease in demand. Every part in the supply chain (importer, distributer, dealer) will come under VAT and it may increase the complexity of VAT calculation and claim. Associated services like financing and registration of the vehicle will also become costlier. The customers will be most affected with the price rise and there will be an import VAT for cross border supply.

<img src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Impact-of-Vat-MamoreBlog-fig2.jpg" width="681" height="304" />

<strong>Conclusion</strong>
VAT is most likely going to increase the inflation rate in Kuwait. Introduction of VAT is likely to increase the rate to 3.75% from the predicted 2.5% at the year-end of 2018. (IMF)  While real estate, transportation and automobile will see a decrease in demand, retail, financial sector, oil & gas and telecom might not see much changes. Real estate is expected to see the maximum increase in cost while retail might see a low to medium increase in price. Although some sectors will find it difficult to implement VAT, going forward, it might become easier.

		<Title>[:en]Trade Wars - How will it play out for the GCC?[:ar]الحروب التجارية – ما هو مصيرها في دول مجلس التعاون الخليجي؟[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">
<div style="text-align: left;">

The fears of a trade war were looming large ever since Donald Trump took charge as the U.S president. In an attempt to revive domestic industries, the U.S president has decided to levy charges on imports of steel and aluminum, signaling a potential trade war. After taking nearly a decade to bring back the optimism to the world economy post-financial crisis, the development of a trade war could become a deterrent to global growth.

Trade wars are an unfavorable outcome for any party involved as it could lead to rise in inflation and affect the global economy that is heavily dependent on trade. The ramifications of the tariff would not only be limited to the steel and aluminum industries, but also on dependent industries worldwide including the Oil and Gas industry. Trade dependent emerging markets such as China and Southeast Asia, which contribute to the majority of global oil demand growth, would face an economic slowdown, eventually affecting the price of Oil and thereby the economic growth of Gulf countries.

The U.S administration is moving ahead with the imposition of import tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum, but has already exempted Canada and Mexico temporarily and offered to exclude other allies. There are also signs that these impositions are not likely to stop with steel and aluminum but continue onto a wide range of products. The move falls in line with the U.S President’s agenda to limit Chinese investments in the country and reduce the massive trade deficit existing between the nations.

<strong>Bilateral Trade in goods with the U.S during 2017 (in USD Bn)</strong>
<img src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Trade-War-Marmore-Blog-Fig1.jpg" width="681" height="304" />

<blockquote>Among GCC countries, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are the biggest trade partners for the U.S. with bilateral trade amounting to USD 35.1bn and USD 24.3bn in 2017, respectively. In the case of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Oman, imports into the U.S. were dominated by crude and related products while for the UAE and Bahrain, Aluminum was the main import commodity. Emirates Global Aluminum is the third-largest producer of primary aluminum outside China and the U.S accounts for 5% of total sales for Emirates Steel, the largest steel producer in the UAE (Reauters).</blockquote>
<strong>Why is a trade war not good for oil prices?</strong>
Consumption of oil and the health of an economy generally have high correlation; therefore, a slowdown of the global economy would result in shortfall of oil demand. Global oil demand which was expected to increase by 1.5 million barrels a day in 2018 (IEA estimates), is under severe threat owing to the protectionist stance taken by the U.S. A slowdown in global trade as a consequence of an anticipated trade war could be detrimental for the demand for oil in a situation where OPEC and its allies are trying to restrict supply and boost oil prices. China and other emerging economies like India, who are some of the major importers of oil, are expected to face an economic slowdown contributing to a shortfall in oil demand.

Despite the tariffs not having a direct impact on fuel, the construction and automotive industries which are dependent on metals would incur more costs triggering a slowdown in economic activity. Additionally, the fuel requirement in the maritime and transport industry will also come down. Long story short, a trade war is highly likely to result in oil prices going down. Hence, the GCC countries whose major source of revenues being oil are likely to face the aftermath if oil prices drop down.

<strong>Is there light at the end of the tunnel?</strong>
Apart from the obvious concerns over fall in oil prices, the direct impact for the non-oil industries are expected to be minimal at the moment for the GCC. The UAE, which is the third largest exporter of aluminum into the U.S after China and Russia, has sought for exemptions from the import tariffs(Reuters ).

However, GCC countries find themselves in an interesting position. In 2017, U.S crude exports into China amounted to 0.45 million barrels per day making China the largest market for the U.S outside North America. The U.S has been slowly chipping away the market share of Saudi Arabia in Asia, particularly China as WTI crude prices trade at a discount to Brent and other crude giving them a price advantage. Saudi Arabia, in contrast, uses Oman and Dubai prices as an underlying benchmark to price its oil in Asian markets.

Although the size of U.S oil exports to China is small, it has been growing lately contributing to 7.1% of total crude exports from the U.S in 2017. Amidst the friction between U.S and China, a window of opportunity has opened up for oil producers from the GCC. Trade retaliation from China towards the U.S could allow them to capture a sizeable part of China’s lucrative oil market.

Despite drawing criticism on several fronts, the U.S administration is likely to move ahead with the import tariffs. Other nations are expected to retaliate with counter-tariffs and possibly move to WTO to resolve the issue. Whether this would turn into a full-fledged trade war between nations is yet to be seen. However, in any war, trade or military, there is no clear winner. Despite the claims from the U.S president that trade wars are good and easy to win, the likely outcome of it seems to be a loss-loss scenario for all parties concerned, ultimately making it a war where everyone loses.

The fears of a trade war were looming large ever since Donald Trump took charge as the U.S president. In an attempt to revive domestic industries, the U.S president has decided to levy charges on imports of steel and aluminum, signaling a potential trade war. After taking nearly a decade to bring back the optimism to the world economy post-financial crisis, the development of a trade war could become a deterrent to global growth.

Trade wars are an unfavorable outcome for any party involved as it could lead to rise in inflation and affect the global economy that is heavily dependent on trade. The ramifications of the tariff would not only be limited to the steel and aluminum industries, but also on dependent industries worldwide including the Oil and Gas industry. Trade dependent emerging markets such as China and Southeast Asia, which contribute to the majority of global oil demand growth, would face an economic slowdown, eventually affecting the price of Oil and thereby the economic growth of Gulf countries.

The U.S administration is moving ahead with the imposition of import tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum, but has already exempted Canada and Mexico temporarily and offered to exclude other allies. There are also signs that these impositions are not likely to stop with steel and aluminum but continue onto a wide range of products. The move falls in line with the U.S President’s agenda to limit Chinese investments in the country and reduce the massive trade deficit existing between the nations.

<strong>Bilateral Trade in goods with the U.S during 2017 (in USD Bn)</strong>

<blockquote>Among GCC countries, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are the biggest trade partners for the U.S. with bilateral trade amounting to USD 35.1bn and USD 24.3bn in 2017, respectively. In the case of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Oman, imports into the U.S. were dominated by crude and related products while for the UAE and Bahrain, Aluminum was the main import commodity. Emirates Global Aluminum is the third-largest producer of primary aluminum outside China and the U.S accounts for 5% of total sales for Emirates Steel, the largest steel producer in the UAE (Reauters).</blockquote>
<strong>Why is a trade war not good for oil prices?</strong>
Consumption of oil and the health of an economy generally have high correlation; therefore, a slowdown of the global economy would result in shortfall of oil demand. Global oil demand which was expected to increase by 1.5 million barrels a day in 2018 (IEA estimates), is under severe threat owing to the protectionist stance taken by the U.S. A slowdown in global trade as a consequence of an anticipated trade war could be detrimental for the demand for oil in a situation where OPEC and its allies are trying to restrict supply and boost oil prices. China and other emerging economies like India, who are some of the major importers of oil, are expected to face an economic slowdown contributing to a shortfall in oil demand.

Despite the tariffs not having a direct impact on fuel, the construction and automotive industries which are dependent on metals would incur more costs triggering a slowdown in economic activity. Additionally, the fuel requirement in the maritime and transport industry will also come down. Long story short, a trade war is highly likely to result in oil prices going down. Hence, the GCC countries whose major source of revenues being oil are likely to face the aftermath if oil prices drop down.

<strong>Is there light at the end of the tunnel?</strong>
Apart from the obvious concerns over fall in oil prices, the direct impact for the non-oil industries are expected to be minimal at the moment for the GCC. The UAE, which is the third largest exporter of aluminum into the U.S after China and Russia, has sought for exemptions from the import tariffs(Reuters ).

However, GCC countries find themselves in an interesting position. In 2017, U.S crude exports into China amounted to 0.45 million barrels per day making China the largest market for the U.S outside North America. The U.S has been slowly chipping away the market share of Saudi Arabia in Asia, particularly China as WTI crude prices trade at a discount to Brent and other crude giving them a price advantage. Saudi Arabia, in contrast, uses Oman and Dubai prices as an underlying benchmark to price its oil in Asian markets.

		<Title>[:en]How Inflationary is VAT in the GCC?[:ar]ما هو مستوى تضخم ضريبة القيمة المضافة في دول مجلس التعاون الخليجي؟[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">
<div style="text-align: left;">

The residents of Saudi Arabia and the UAE, who had long enjoyed a tax-free existence, were finally subject to a Value Added Tax of 5% on goods and services, from Jan 1<sup>st</sup> 2018. The introduction of VAT, which is seen as one of the biggest policy shifts in recent times across the region, is expected to bring in additional revenue to the respective governments. VAT being a consumption based tax, will have implications on customer spending as well as inflation. As of 2018, Saudi Arabia and UAE are the only GCC countries to implement VAT, with the others aiming to follow suit in 2019.

Considering that interest rates and economic growth have a bigger influence on inflation, there is little doubt that the short-term effects of VAT on prices, will pose challenges to both consumers and businesses. The additional expenses incurred due to the addition of VAT are likely to have a bigger impact on high value purchases than day-to-day expenditures.

After the inception of VAT, both Saudi Arabia and the UAE witnessed a sharp rise in inflation for the month of January 2018. Annual inflation for January 2018 spiked to 3.0% and 4.7% for Saudi Arabia and the UAE respectively. Compared to the prices of December 2017 significant changes were seen in prices of Clothing & Footwear, Restaurants & Hotels, Transport and Tobacco. Notably, the annual inflation on tobacco products was more than 50%. However, this was due to the implementation of a 100% sin tax in both countries for tobacco products. Inflation on transport was also higher owing to the subsidy cuts in fuel.
<blockquote>Taking the case of UAE, the effect on inflation in January 2018 could’ve been worse if not for the weak real estate market which resulted in a decline of residential rents. Lower rents therefore helped offset some of the inflation effect as housing and utilities form a significant chunk of the price basket. For Saudi Arabia, the change in base year for consumer price calculation from 2008 to 2013, helped bring down its inflation figures.</blockquote>
<strong>Change in Consumer Price Index – Jan 2018</strong>

In the UAE, housing, healthcare and education costs did not see a major change as they were exempted from VAT. Despite public transport and air travel not falling under the purview of VAT, transport costs rose by 4% in Jan 2018 compared to the previous month due to the taxation on fuel. The case was similar in Saudi Arabia where housing and education were not affected. Cost of apparels including clothing and footwear fell by 2.3% between Dec ’17 and Jan ’18 despite being taxed, as they were being heavily discounted due to the slump in sales.

While the introduction of VAT has effected a push up in inflation for January, its impact is expected to fade over time. Japan, which increased its VAT from 5% to 8% during April 2014, witnessed an immediate impact on its inflation rates which surged to 3.7% in May 2014. However, the rates eased off to 0.5% after 12 months. Evidences from other global cases also suggest likewise.

Although 5% VAT is lower compared to several other countries worldwide, it sets a precedent that governments in the GCC are willing to adopt subsidy cuts and levy taxes in order to strengthen their finances. The introduction of VAT would nudge consumers to spend more responsibly and change their spending patterns. Prices of products would also come down in order to match the demand eventually leading to a decrease in inflation.

<strong>Fiscal breakeven oil prices (in USD/bbl)</strong>

Fiscal break-even oil price is the minimum oil price needed to meet the spending commitments of oil-exporting country while balancing its budgets [BEP = {(Government Expenditure minus Non-oil revenue)/Oil quantity produced} + per barrel cost of production] (Fiscal Breakeven Oil Price). Prior to the collapse of oil prices, fiscal break-even oil prices were rising rapidly in GCC countries, reflecting the substantial increase in government spending by an annual average of 11 per cent in real terms in 2003-2014 (Gulf News). Moreover, the increasing government expenditures were largely due to rising salaries, wages and subsidies; expenses that were hard to control given the welfare economic model that is prevalent which subsequently made it difficult for the government to lower the breakeven oil prices. This led many analysts to think that lowering of BEP would be hard. However, the new realities due to low oil price environment had led to dramatic changes including curbing of subsidies and introduction of new non-oil revenue sources.

There are three main factors which drive the movement in fiscal GCC break-even oil prices. First is the value of hydrocarbon exports, second changes in non-hydrocarbon government revenues (accounted for 30 per cent of total government revenues in the past five years) and finally change in government spending. An increase in the value of oil exports, improving non-hydrocarbon revenues and a decline in spending will all contribute to lower fiscal breakeven oil prices.

Fiscal consolidation efforts by the government including restrained spending and growth in oil revenues (compared to the previous year) due to gradual rise in oil prices led to a decline in fiscal breakeven oil prices in 2017. Whereas in 2018, improving non-oil revenues is expected to be the main factor in reducing the breakeven prices. Unlike other oil-exporting countries, GCC currencies are pegged to the dollar, and thus most of the adjustment to lower oil prices has been on the fiscal side. Reduced government spending has so far been the most prevalent measure to lower break-even oil prices in the GCC countries after crude oil prices shed by more than half in the last two years.

Source: IMF
Additional adjustment in 2018 will focus on mobilization of non-hydrocarbon revenues, including higher fees and charges, introduction of value-added tax in early 2018 and privatization moves (IIF). As a first step, countries are introducing a VAT and other consumption taxes — for example on tobacco and sugar-sweetened beverages. Over time, governments may also consider deriving additional revenues from income and property taxation. These efforts are expected to raise revenues by 1-2 per cent of GDP, assuming a VAT rate of 5 per cent (IMF).

In Saudi Arabia, this would lead to much lower fiscal break-even oil prices, a decline of 24 percent from USD 96.6 to USD 73.1 per barrel of crude oil in 2017. Kuwait and Qatar will have break-evens below the oil price, more than enough to balance the budget in 2018. Overall, the weighted average fiscal breakeven oil price for the GCC has declined steadily since it peaked at USD 87/bbl in 2014 to USD 69/bbl in 2016 and USD 66/bbl in 2017.

		<Title>[:en]How do you mimic the price performance of spot oil market? - The answer is its nearly impossible[:ar]كيف تحاكي أداء سعر سوق النفط الفوري؟ - الجواب هو أن هذا الأمر مستحيل تقريباً.[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">

Crude oil by a wide margin is the most traded commodity in the world and arguably the most important. Having hit lows of less than USD 43 a barrel in the summer, WTI crude has spent the second half of the year on a steadily rising trend and looks set to end 2017 somewhere close to USD 60. The main driving force behind the oil price rise has been OPEC’s decision to maintain oil production cuts that started in December 2016. The degree of compliance by members of the oil cartel has also improved as the year progressed.

The last few years indicate that calling the direction of oil prices with any degree of accuracy is very difficult. However as the oil prices show a recovery trend many will be tempted to gain from the surging oil prices. The spot price is relatively unimportant in global oil markets. Most refiners purchase oil with the help of long-term contracts, either one-off privately negotiated contracts or standard contracts from an exchange. But the idea of spot price is one that fascinates investors - everyone is intent on trying to invest in something that tracks "the price of oil" as closely as possible. In 2016, WTI oil price return was a remarkable 46% which further extended by 9.4% YTD as of 15<sup>th</sup> December.

<strong>WTI Spot price (Dollars per Barrel)</strong>

Crude Oil ETFs track the price changes of crude oil, allowing investors to gain exposure to this market without the need for a futures account. There are many exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that focus solely on oil. Each ETF is structured slightly differently depending on the futures contract it holds, but all aim to give investors an easy way to invest in oil. The oil ETFs are all highly correlated with the spot price of benchmark it tracks. However, it is important to understand the reason behind the variation in the returns of these investable alternatives as none exactly tracks the spot's return. In fact, against the near double digit returns of spot oil this year 90% of the top performing oil ETFs have lost the money.

<strong>Top performing Oil ETFs vs WTI Crude oil</strong>

Source: ETFdb; Data as of December 15, 2017

The simple reason for wide variance between ETFs and spot oil price performance is that the ETFs rely on future contracts to get exposure to oil, and futures prices, by definition, are not spot oil. As a futures contract comes close to its due date, its price can approach (or converge) to spot. But the futures price starts either higher or lower than spot, meaning that the market values futures oil more or less than spot oil it can take delivery today. One of the key reasons behind the mismatch in ETF returns and spot oil price is due to a phenomenon termed ‘contango’ which has a huge impact on investors return in oil futures contracts. Contango is the situation where the ‘out-month’ contracts are more expensive than the ‘near-month’ contract. When that's the case, there are real costs to allowing a contract to roll forward into the next month's contract. Thus there is a roll cost or yield involved in buying next month’s futures which lower the profit margins. In fact, contango can turn rising oil prices into a loss if it is steep enough.

As opposed to this when markets are in backwardation a situation where long-dated contracts are cheaper than next month futures, futures-based products will generally outperform spot prices. The oil ETFs actually outperformed spot WTI when crude prices plummeted in 2008 (ETFdb). While contango destroys value for oil ETF investors, backwardation creates it.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>
Ultimately, there may be no possible solution or financial instrument to accurately capture the price performance of spot oil.  However, it is of utmost importance to understand clearly what it is we are really trying to capture. It's natural to think about the spot price of oil. But including oil as a commodity play within an asset allocation framework could add substantial risk in an investor’s portfolio. The front-month contract may simply be the best economic proxy available, since the roll yield inherent in the futures market can severely affect the return performance of ETF which is significantly influenced by factors other than just the movement in the price of oil. Thus while an investor can watch the daily movement in oil price, they cannot hold it and realize returns identical to the spot price movements.

		<Title>[:en]Could Private debt be the new theme for SMEs to access capital?[:ar]هل يكون الدين الخاص مدخل المشروعات الصغيرة والمتوسطة إلى رؤوس الأموال؟[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">
<div style="text-align: left;">

The global financial crisis has been the turnaround for the private debt market as it is now widely accepted as an asset class of its own. The increase in both supply and demand is having a significant impact on how alternative lending funds are being used. In recent years, there has been an influx of new entrants and greater diversity of investment strategies. The banking industry is forced to re-evaluate less-profitable and high-risk sectors, which has resulted in private debt markets gaining prominence since a decade.

The SME sector in the GCC accounts for $360bn per year, or about 26% of GDP. It is expected to grow rapidly and more than double to reach $920bn over the next five years (Waha Capital). Most of this growth is expected to come from the UAE and Saudi Arabia. A majority of SMEs in the region will require financing needs over the next couple of years.

From a credit perspective, SME access to formal credit from the banking system in the GCC is low. Banks in GCC are not best positioned to finance the capital due to the nature of the financing that usually involves long tenors, absence of amortization and equity comparable returns. Historically, this financing requirement has been filled mostly by equity, but may sometimes involve a dilution of the promoter’s equity. This provides an opportunity for innovative credit solutions that make sense for both investors and borrowers. Investors are now starting to take notice, and one can see definite green shoots emerging slowly but surely. For instance, the implementation of the Bankruptcy Law in the UAE is an important step along with the setup of the UAE Credit Bureau. While the legal and regulatory environment still lag behind when compared to more advanced markets, there has been a visible progress. Banks also lend to companies based on their track records and exercise much more precaution on riskier loans. Certain companies therefore may find it difficult to secure loans due to lack of credibility and look for private debt as an alternative.

The Middle East has experienced a period of softening growth along with a rise in fiscal deficits, which has led to historically-low returns across asset classes since 2014. As a result, the hunt for higher yields has entered a new territory within the MENA region in general and GCC in particular, which has led to the emergence of private debt, albeit selectively among investors with longer-time horizons with the aim to exploit the current illiquidity crisis. The importance of private debt as one of the core components of funding cannot be underrated for fast-growing, medium-sized companies in the GCC region.

For regional SMEs that are exploring non-traditional debt sources, there are a series of options that have emerged over the past couple of years. There are tailor-made products such as peer-to-peer lending, crowd funding for fast-growing small- and middle-segment companies that have leveraged low operating costs, minimal regulations and big data technology to provide quicker access to cash.

However, GCC businesses with riskier models or those which are currently distressed and cash-strapped are the ones which now have a new avenue to gain capital through private debt. Additionally, the private debt market is going to be a crucial vehicle in the region, with the UAE being the first nation to approve a bankruptcy law.

For example, under the new UAE insolvency law, the advantage of exploring the private debt option for a borrower will enable them to focus more on structural customization to match their financing needs compared to bank financing. Private lenders have also earned a reputation for being faster, more flexible and more predictable counterparties than banks. The disadvantage is generally the pricing as private loans tend to be more expensive than bank loans.

However, lack of proper regulations in place and a failure to comply with Islamic law within the region demand a cautious approach for successful implementation of newly-formed lending strategies. In addition, brand presence and perception play a crucial role in the region. Nevertheless, with banks slowly stepping back from the debt segment and demand for direct funding outpacing supply, the private debt sector is only going to rise further. This does not mean a complete exit from traditional platforms such as banks from the lending space, but rather a potential for more collaboration with private lenders.

Although the private debt market is at a very nascent stage, it has the potential to become an attractive asset class similar to the success witnessed in the US and Europe. Further, the positive change in sentiment towards alternative lenders has also opened opportunities for SMEs and institutions alike.

The most likelihood sources of private debt will include public and private pension funds, foundations, endowments and insurance companies. In real estate sector, as historical limitation of terms on lending from commercial banks remain, up to 10 per cent of the total real estate debt market could come from private debt providers within the next decade. Collective investment vehicles may also emerge as debt providers since investors see debt as an attractive capital stack for taking real estate exposure, especially given the current interest rate cycle (JLL).

As the private debt offer more flexibility and are tailored in nature, there is a general recognition that these instruments will be priced at a premium compared to more traditional bank lending. Private debt could be priced between 100 -150 bps above conventional bank lending in GCC, suggesting private senior debt’s pricing in the range of 6% to 7% on core transactions (JLL).

Private debt has the potential to become a dominant lending avenue for development of fast-growing SMEs. However, the regulatory environment will be critical for growth going forward and the private debt market's ability to operate and adhere to stringent and rapidly changing regulations will be key to its success.

The global financial crisis has been the turnaround for the private debt market as it is now widely accepted as an asset class of its own. The increase in both supply and demand is having a significant impact on how alternative lending funds are being used. In recent years, there has been an influx of new entrants and greater diversity of investment strategies. The banking industry is forced to re-evaluate less-profitable and high-risk sectors, which has resulted in private debt markets gaining prominence since a decade.

The SME sector in the GCC accounts for $360bn per year, or about 26% of GDP. It is expected to grow rapidly and more than double to reach $920bn over the next five years (Waha Capital). Most of this growth is expected to come from the UAE and Saudi Arabia. A majority of SMEs in the region will require financing needs over the next couple of years.

From a credit perspective, SME access to formal credit from the banking system in the GCC is low. Banks in GCC are not best positioned to finance the capital due to the nature of the financing that usually involves long tenors, absence of amortization and equity comparable returns. Historically, this financing requirement has been filled mostly by equity, but may sometimes involve a dilution of the promoter’s equity. This provides an opportunity for innovative credit solutions that make sense for both investors and borrowers. Investors are now starting to take notice, and one can see definite green shoots emerging slowly but surely. For instance, the implementation of the Bankruptcy Law in the UAE is an important step along with the setup of the UAE Credit Bureau. While the legal and regulatory environment still lag behind when compared to more advanced markets, there has been a visible progress. Banks also lend to companies based on their track records and exercise much more precaution on riskier loans. Certain companies therefore may find it difficult to secure loans due to lack of credibility and look for private debt as an alternative.

The Middle East has experienced a period of softening growth along with a rise in fiscal deficits, which has led to historically-low returns across asset classes since 2014. As a result, the hunt for higher yields has entered a new territory within the MENA region in general and GCC in particular, which has led to the emergence of private debt, albeit selectively among investors with longer-time horizons with the aim to exploit the current illiquidity crisis. The importance of private debt as one of the core components of funding cannot be underrated for fast-growing, medium-sized companies in the GCC region.

For regional SMEs that are exploring non-traditional debt sources, there are a series of options that have emerged over the past couple of years. There are tailor-made products such as peer-to-peer lending, crowd funding for fast-growing small- and middle-segment companies that have leveraged low operating costs, minimal regulations and big data technology to provide quicker access to cash.

However, GCC businesses with riskier models or those which are currently distressed and cash-strapped are the ones which now have a new avenue to gain capital through private debt. Additionally, the private debt market is going to be a crucial vehicle in the region, with the UAE being the first nation to approve a bankruptcy law.

For example, under the new UAE insolvency law, the advantage of exploring the private debt option for a borrower will enable them to focus more on structural customization to match their financing needs compared to bank financing. Private lenders have also earned a reputation for being faster, more flexible and more predictable counterparties than banks. The disadvantage is generally the pricing as private loans tend to be more expensive than bank loans.

However, lack of proper regulations in place and a failure to comply with Islamic law within the region demand a cautious approach for successful implementation of newly-formed lending strategies. In addition, brand presence and perception play a crucial role in the region. Nevertheless, with banks slowly stepping back from the debt segment and demand for direct funding outpacing supply, the private debt sector is only going to rise further.

		<Title>[:en]Kuwait and GCC Markets Give up some of the gains in August[:ar]الاسواق الكويتية والخليجية تتخلى عن بعض المكاسب في أغسطس[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">
<div style="text-align: left;">

According to our recently released Monthly Market Review for the month of August, the positive momentum that prevailed in the recent months among GCC indices has halted during the month as the investors booked their profits. Turmoil in Turkey and pull out of much and long awaited IPO of Saudi Aramco contributed to the negative sentiment.

Kuwait all share index lost 0.7% for the month. Despite the losses registered in this month, Saudi Arabian and Kuwait indices’ returns for the year remained healthy at 10.0% and 4.5%, respectively. Among Kuwait’s blue chip companies, Zain was the leading decliner, down by 1.9% during the month while Boubyan Bank share price moved upwards, gaining 2.5% in August. The decline in Zain stock was due to investors partially booking profits after it posted strong financials earlier during the month. The average traded value of Kuwait All Share index dipped by ~21% in the month of August to USD 69.25Mn as compared to previous month. The liquidity was affected mainly due to subdued trading due to summer month lull.

The S&P GCC index a comprehensive benchmark that covers stocks from all GCC countries, was down 2.5% for the month, reducing the overall gains for the year to 9.6%. During the month of August, Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul index lost 4.2% as selling pressure from foreign investors intensified. Abu Dhabi index was the best performer in the region for the month, gaining 2.6% and pushing its YTD returns to 13.4%. This was in sharp contrast to the Dubai market, which lost 3.9% for the month, extending its losses to 15.7% for the year. In terms of YTD performance, Qatar index delivered 16.0% since the beginning of the year making it the best performing market across emerging and developed markets globally. Qatar markets continued to remain strong post Moody’s decision to change the country’s sovereign outlook from negative to stable.

Ezdan Holdings and First Abu Dhabi Bank and were the top performers among GCC blue chip companies, rising by 14.4% and 8.8% during the month respectively. The First Abu Dhabi Bank posted strong financials during the first half of 2018. The group’s net profit rose by 10% yoy to AED 6.1Bn (USD 1.16b). The biggest lender in the UAE is also expected to have its weighting in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index doubled to almost 0.2% in November. Ezdan Holding Group too saw a surge in profits by 52.5% in Q2 2018 as compared to same period last year. Ezdan's net profits amounted to QAR 320.11Mn (USD 88.4Mn) in the period between April to June.

MSCI EM index also remained under selling pressure, as investors’ appetite remained weak due to global uncertainties like EM currency depreciation against USD, trade war concerns, etc. MSCI EM index closed 2.9% down. On the other hand, MSCI World index ended the month on a positive note, registering 1.0% gain for the month.

<strong>Oil Market Review</strong>
Oil prices showed a sharp recovery towards the end of the month, thereby leading to a positive return of 4.3% during the month, increasing the YTD gains to 15.8%. Oil prices hovered around the USD 70 per barrel mark during the month as the fears on trade tension that could crimp global economic growth and increase financial vulnerability intensified. However, it ended the month on a positive note closing at USD 77.4 per barrel as the Unipec of China affirmed that it would resume purchasing of U.S crude oil from October combined with higher than anticipated production cut by OPEC led coalition. OPEC has anticipated oil demand growth to increase by 1.64 mb/d in 2018 with demand growth mainly coming from non-OECD nations such as China and India. Non-OPEC oil supply in 2018 is expected to average 59.62 mb/d, representing an increase of 2.08 mb/d y-o-y. Non-OPEC oil supply in 2019 is projected to reach an average of 61.75 mb/d.

<strong>Saudi Aramco IPO dilemma</strong>
Saudi Arabia has been planning to float its national oil company Saudi Aramco on the equity market for the past two years. According to media reports, Saudi Arabia has put the IPO on hold. The public listing that brings along increased scrutiny and disclosure requirements is cited as one of the main reason behind putting the IPO on hold. Recovery of oil price, which has now more than doubled since its low in 2016 and successful issuance of bonds to raise capital from international markets has enabled KSA to better manage its finances. Further, the oil giant has hinted towards a proposed stake in local petrochemicals maker Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC). This could imply Saudi Arabia's sovereign fund may look to borrow up to USD 11Bn from international banks with a spread of 75 basis points over LIBOR.[:ar]<div style="text-align: justify;">

According to our recently released Monthly Market Review for the month of July, the second half of the year started on a good note for the stock markets of Kuwait and its regional peers, as they continue to yield positive results. Kuwait markets registered a positive performance for the month of July, as its All Share index gained 5.7%, propelling its YTD gains to 9.6%. Among Kuwait’s blue chip companies, Zain, Kuwait Financial House (KFH) and National Bank of Kuwait (NBK) were the best performers, gaining 11.7%, 8.2% and 8.0% respectively in July. The positive investor sentiment prevailing over banking stocks, on the back of promising Q2 2018 results have aided the performance of Kuwait’s leading banks. In addition, the impending merger of KFH with Ahli United Bank has also had a positive impact on the investors after an announcement was made by KFH regarding the appointment of HSBC and Credit Suisse to help arrive at a fair share exchange ratio. The announcement regarding Kuwait’s potential MSCI upgrade at the end of June boosted the country’s blue chips, which posted impressive gains at the start of July and sustained them until the end of the month.

The S&P GCC index was up 2.2% for the month, pushing the YTD returns further to 12.4%. Both MSCI EM and MSCI World were positive for the month, as they gained 1.7% and 3.1% respectively. The performance of S&P GCC index was supported by strong performance of banking stocks across the region. Qatar’s index was the best performer in the region for July with monthly gains of 8.9%, pushing its YTD returns to 15.3%.  This was in sharp contrast to the Oman market, which lost 5.1% for the month, extending its losses to 15.0% for the year.

Industries Qatar and Qatar National Bank were the top performers among blue chip companies, rising by 16.4% and 15.1% during the month respectively. With four of Qatar’s top six companies being banks and one of the other two being Industries Qatar, the positivity in macroeconomic conditions such as rise in interest rates and high oil prices have had a major influence on the country’s stock index. Qatar markets were also boosted by the decision of Moody’s to change the country’s sovereign outlook from negative to stable.

<strong>MENA Market trends</strong>
Major Banks in the GCC region have posted solid earnings for the second quarter of 2018. Profitability of banks and financial institutions in the region have been boosted by rising interest rates, uptick in economic activity and increased government spending.

Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has been proactive in launching initiatives that help in improving the business environment of the country. Initiatives include the introduction of new draft law to regulate public and private partnerships, in addition to the earlier proposed bankruptcy law, which is expected to come into effect by August. These laws are expected to remove regulatory impediments for doing business in the country and bring in more foreign inflows into the country’s private sector.

<strong>Oil Market Review</strong>
Oil price witnessed a fall of 6.5% during the month, as the price of Brent crude settled down at USD 74 per barrel, reducing the YTD gains to 11%. Oil price hovered around the USD 80 per barrel mark at the start of the month due to the supply disruptions from Venezuela and Iran. The increased supply from Saudi Arabia and Russia helped ease the demand and bring down oil price to a lower yet healthy level. OPEC released its initial forecast for oil supply and demand in 2019 during the month. According to the forecast, demand for oil is expected to breach the 100 million bpd threshold for the first time.

According to our recently released Monthly Market Review for the month of June, GCC Stock Markets continued to post positive results, marking another positive month. The S&P GCC index was up 1.1% for the month and is now up 9.9% for the year, making it as one of the best performing regions in the world. Both MSCI EM and MSCI World were negative for the month. MSCI EM shed 4.6%, while, MSCI World lost 0.2%. The performance of S&P GCC index was supported by a good show by Saudi Arabia following favorable news flow including MSCI inclusion and increased oil production while other GCC markets were mixed during the month. Tadawul added 1.9% for the month brining its overall gains in 2018 to 15.1%, the highest in the GCC region. This is in sharp contrast to the Dubai market that has so far lost 16.3% for the year.

Zain and Ooredoo were the top gainers amongst the blue chips companies in GCC for the month, rising by 16.0% and 8.4% respectively. MSCI’s decision to include Kuwait for its annual classification review for 2019 which was announced close to the end of the month, proved to be a boost for Kuwait’s blue-chip stocks whose prices consequently witnessed a rebound. Saudi Arabia, which was the best performing GCC market during H1 2018 with YTD returns of 15.1%, had a turbulent month, with its stocks rallying back and forth due to uncertainties over OPEC’s oil output announcement and a mild market correction after the MSCI upgrade, eventually posting a gain of 1.9% for the month. Anxiety over Dubai’s property market outlook weighed in on its equity index as major real estate and construction players like Emaar Properties and Drake & Scull International posted negative returns.

<strong>MENA Market trends</strong>
The uptick in oil prices have buoyed GCC countries, who have resumed their capital spending to revive the economic growth that has stagnated in the recent past. In Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed announced a USD 13.6 (50 billion dhirams) economic package to attract new sectors, industries, investments and to create 10,000 jobs for locals in the next couple of years.

On the other hand, the cost of insuring Bahrain’s sovereign debt against default hit a new high as investors concern over the country’s debt burden fanned fears following U.S interest rates hike.

Meanwhile, investors spat at the private equity firm – The Abraaj Group, has hurt investors’ confidence, renewed concerns over governance and internal systems, and threaten to stunt the development of the nascent private equity industry in the region.

<strong>Oil Market Review</strong>
Fall in production of Venezuela and Libya in addition to the reduced output from Iran due to U.S. sanctions have been supportive in keeping oil prices higher than 2017 levels. The expectations of an increase in oil output promised by Saudi Arabia and Russia failed to keep prices down as Brent crude prices surged by 2.1% for the month. The YTD gains have remained solid at 19.8% and is expected to sustain its level due to continued supply disruptions from other OPEC members and a brewing trade war between the U.S and its major trade allies.  Because of the ongoing tussle between the U.S. and China, if China imposes a 25% duty on U.S crude imports, American supply would become uncompetitive, forcing Chinese buyers to look at alternate suppliers. The constant shift in dynamic of the oil markets is expected to keep prices on the higher side for the near future.

<strong>MENA Market trends</strong>
The uptick in oil prices have buoyed GCC countries, who have resumed their capital spending to revive the economic growth that has stagnated in the recent past. In Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed announced a USD 13.6 (50 billion dhirams) economic package to attract new sectors, industries, investments and to create 10,000 jobs for locals in the next couple of years.

On the other hand, the cost of insuring Bahrain’s sovereign debt against default hit a new high as investors concern over the country’s debt burden fanned fears following U.S interest rates hike.

Meanwhile, investors spat at the private equity firm – The Abraaj Group, has hurt investors’ confidence, renewed concerns over governance and internal systems, and threaten to stunt the development of the nascent private equity industry in the region.

<strong>Oil Market Review</strong>
Fall in production of Venezuela and Libya in addition to the reduced output from Iran due to U.S. sanctions have been supportive in keeping oil prices higher than 2017 levels. The expectations of an increase in oil output promised by Saudi Arabia and Russia failed to keep prices down as Brent crude prices surged by 2.1% for the month. The YTD gains have remained solid at 19.8% and is expected to sustain its level due to continued supply disruptions from other OPEC members and a brewing trade war between the U.S and its major trade allies.  Because of the ongoing tussle between the U.S. and China, if China imposes a 25% duty on U.S crude imports, American supply would become uncompetitive, forcing Chinese buyers to look at alternate suppliers. The constant shift in dynamic of the oil markets is expected to keep prices on the higher side for the near future.

The bond market in the GCC region saw bond issuances to the tune of USD 70 bn, an all-time high issued amount in the year 2017 (https://www.thenational.ae/business/markets/strong-appetite-for-gcc-credit-forecast-for-2018-1.699843) The first quarter of 2018 has already seen issuances worth USD 16.8 bn, mostly by Oman (39% approx.) and Qatar National Bank (22% approx.). Oman has managed to sell its largest ever sovereign bond worth USD 6.5 bn in face of multiple downgrades in credit ratings from companies like Moody’s and Fitch in 2018. All of these show that although there exist certain challenges for GCC bonds, there is a growing demand for them from investors across emerging and developed markets. With the expectation that 2018 will also see a strong issuance of bonds, let us look at some of the reasons that are fuelling the appetite for Gulf bonds in the bond market.

<strong>GCC USD Issuances (USD bn)</strong>

Note: Includes issuances of USD 250 mn and above. Contains both sovereign and corporate issuances

<strong>Increased Interest from Foreign Investors </strong>
GCC bond markets have seen a surge in foreign investment in the last two years. More than 75% of the issued bonds (mainly the sovereign bonds) in 2017 were comfortably absorbed by non-GCC investors. This can be seen when a USD 750 mn bond issued by National Bank of Kuwait had 57% as U.S investors, followed by 26% Middle East investors, 13% European and 4% Asian investors in May, 2017. This is in stark contrast when the same bank issued an USD 700 mn bond which had 43% as Middle East investors and only 2% as U.S investors in 2015. The Oman bond also saw 93% of investors as non-GCC. Investors who couldn’t avail sovereign bonds due to non-availability caused by increased demand, subscribed to bonds issued by the regional banks and corporate issuers. This increase in investment is backed by improved macro fundamentals in the region supported by the gradual increase in the oil price, translating into improved credit profiles of local companies (Jebel Ali Free Zone was upgraded from B2 to B1, Dubai Electricity and Water Authority was upgraded to a stable outlook with a Baa3 rating) and government.

<strong>Impressive Performance by GCC Bonds</strong>
With an approximate 12% share in Bloomberg Emerging Market Investment Grade Bond Index, GCC bonds have occupied centre stage in the debt market landscape. Stable credit profiles, low debt levels and rising oil prices have increased the appetite for GCC bonds. Further, the bonds are priced attractively with yields that are higher than that of their similarly rated peers. For instance, Saudi Arabia 30yr bond maturing in 2047 yields 30bps higher at 5.07% than Indonesian bond (30yr, 4.78%) which has a lower credit profile compared to KSA (http://businessweekme.com/2018/04/19/bonds-gulf-safe-place-hide/). Similarly, Qatar debt due in 2028 has a yield of 4.45% as compared to 4.15% compared to a Mexico bond with same maturity period and having a lower rating compared to Qatar (http://businessweekme.com/2018/04/19/bonds-gulf-safe-place-hide/). The region also offers a mix of credit rating for wider investment opportunities – from ‘AA’ rating of Kuwait and Abu Dhabi to ‘BBB-‘of Oman. One primary reason for higher yield is due to the risk premium associated with the GCC bonds for heightened political risk. Among major developed economies like Europe (almost 60% of sovereign bonds) and Japan (https://www.investing.com/rates-bonds) have negative yields and investors are looking for bonds with positive yields, which is driving the demand for GCC bonds. Benchmark eligibility has also contributed to higher performance of the bond.

<strong>US Rate Hike</strong>
With the U.S fed signalling that they would raise interest rate three times in 2018, governments and corporates in the GCC will be looking down to take advantage of the current lower interest rates by issuing more number of bonds in the market. If there is a rate hike, the central banks of the region will be under pressure to raise interest rates. This will raise the yield rate of the bonds. The issuers will like to lock down the borrowing cost at the current rate which will benefit them greatly and hence they are likely to increase the issuance of bonds as soon as possible to raise capital in order to fulfil their current and future capital requirement.

<strong>Improved Structural Reforms</strong>
For sometimes now, GCC countries have begun implementing structural reforms. Some of these changes include developing independent regulatory, statistical, budgeting and auditing bodies for public sectors. Increased transparency and accountability with trade liberalization and prudent principles for public debt management and creating an environment that shall facilitate ease of doing business. This will lead to increased investor confidence in the regional bond market. This will also bring about a wide range of economic benefits that would ultimately result in better credit ratings and translate to lower cost of borrowing for the issuers.
A recent milestone achieved to develop domestic debt market, is the listing of more than 200 bn riyals of government and sukuk bonds in the stock market by KSA. This will help in the secondary bond market, bridge fiscal deficit for the country and reduce reliance on banks for debt. It will also help in making transparent benchmark prices for bonds in KSA.

<strong>Stable CDS Spread</strong>
With most countries in GCC having a decreasing or stable CDS, the outlook on bond market looks positive. A stable CDS spread shows that the investors are focusing more on the positives in the market including the rise in oil price, increased interest by foreign investors and diversification in non-oil economies instead of risks associated with GCC bonds especially the geopolitical ones. This somewhat compensates for the increase in the interest rates.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>
Factors such as increased foreign investment, impressive performance by bonds and improved structural reforms augur well for strong interest and surging investor appetite for bond issuance from the GCC region. However, there are certain concerns that might impede the growth of issuances. Primary among them is the absence of regional harmony which has increased credit market volatility. Embargo on Qatar and anti-corruption measures in KSA have caused shock, leading to widening of CDS spreads. Subsequent fed rate hikes by the U.S would also pose as a headwind. While the bond market ended on a positive note in 2017, the above issues need to be addressed to continue the strong performance in 2018.

		<Title>[:en]Establishing GCC Yield Curve – More Important now than ever![:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]A number of GCC corporates have been active in the debt markets, especially in the recent past, as the bank lending had been constrained while the financial environment offered money at attractive lower interest rates. Considering the surge in issuances and the need for development of domestic debt market many have been advocating for the need to establish a domestic sovereign yield curve that shall help the GCC companies to raise funds at a cheaper rate.

Presence of sovereign yields or availability of rates across maturities would serve as a useful reference point for pricing private domestic debt issues. The yield-to-maturity of a bond is the total return that a bond earns if it is held-to-maturity and all coupons, are reinvested at the same rate (i.e. yield). It is the <em>implied</em> market discount rate. It majorly comprises of two components, the ‘benchmark’ and the ‘spread’. In the absence of any sovereign benchmark, the businesses are forced to borrow debt at a high premium than what their risk may warrant. When a company issues a bond in the absence of a sovereign yield curve, evaluation of such an issue is perplexing. In such cases, the benchmark is that of various issues operating in similar industry. Without the presence of a sovereign yield curve the company paper will be an unknown entity.

<strong>Constituents of Yield to Maturity</strong>
<img src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GCC-Yield-Curve_fig1.jpg" alt="Constituents of Yield to Maturity" />
<em>Source: CFA Institute</em>

The ‘benchmark’ captures the macroeconomic factors - those factors that affect all bonds in the market. The spread captures the microeconomic factors specific to the bond issuer and the bond itself. Fixed-rate bonds often use a government benchmark security with the same time-to-maturity as, or the closest time-to-maturity to, the specified bond. The on-the-run (most recently issued) government bond is the most actively traded security and has a coupon rate closest to the current market discount rate for that maturity.

Therefore, the latest sovereign bond issue for a given maturity is referred to as a benchmark issue. It serves to compare bonds that have the same features but issued by another type of issuer.

A yield curve is a line that plots the interest rates, at a set point in time, of bonds having equal credit quality but differing maturity dates. This yield curve serves as a benchmark for other debt in the domestic market, such as mortgage rates or bank lending rates, and helps to predict changes in economic output and growth. The higher interest rate normally commanded by treasury bonds reflects risk premium.

The GCC countries have been heavily reliant on oil revenues in order to finance their expenditures. This reliance was tested in the summer of 2014 when the oil prices plummeted to a record low. Consequently, GDP growth stalled and the fiscal surpluses vanished amid the need to increase investments in a plethora of projects – infrastructure, health, education, and defence – to ensure long-term growth and diversification.

The liquidity crunch in the region made traditional loan financing difficult for most corporates. While the governments realised that the historical approach to use their abundant forex reserves to cover the budgetary shortfalls would be unsustainable. These forex reserves serve an important purpose to maintain the currency peg, thereby ensuring macroeconomic stability in the region.

As a result, the appetite for GCC bonds soared in 2016. The quantitative easing measures in Europe and elsewhere meant the excess liquidity was seeking to be parked in safe haven assets. Investors started perceiving the sovereign issues from the stable GCC countries as a safe bet, given the low leverage ratios, substantial forex reserves and various reform programs to ensure steady and diverse financing. Moreover, there has been a strong revival in credit markets on a year-to-date basis so far, which augurs well for the debt issuance from the GCC countries.
<br clear="all" /><strong>Debt boomed in 2016, majority being sovereign issues

GCC countries are expected to continue raising funds through bond issuance in the near future. It could result in issuances of new securities at various maturities, which could help in the establishment of sovereign yield curve in the GCC. The construction of benchmark curve is especially important for corporate borrowing as they are expected to be the primary source of fund raising going forward. The government borrowing could decrease going ahead due to rising oil prices, giving way for private sector borrowing. The corporate players would be smart enough to take lesson from the past and not rely just on bank loan as a source of borrowing.

The nature of issuance of sovereign bonds however has been disparate among the countries. While none of the countries currently have an active 30-year domestic bond, Kuwait in particular is constrained by its legislations that prohibits issuance of bonds with a tenure of more than 10 years.
<br clear="all" /><strong>Table: Presence of domestic sovereign issues (active) by maturity

<em>Source: Reuters; Note: None of the GCC countries has 30yr domestic issue. </em>

Despite the improving state of economy (and liquidity), Kuwait government should be an active player in the domestic debt markets and issue notes of varied tenures. The advantages are multi-fold. Positive economic outlook on the account of the rising oil prices and a bullish global investor perspective toward the GCC markets mean issuances could be made at somewhat low, stable yields. This would relieve some pressure on the loan markets, which has been the traditional source of financing until date.

Varied issuances at the sovereign level would help in development of a yield curve, which in turn will help in better pricing of private issues. The systemization of yield data would put a downward pressure on the cost of capital due to increased transparency. It would also be beneficial for the corporate houses based in the country to issue additional domestic debt to finance their operations and explore growth opportunities. Lack of benchmark (hence transparency) would result in increased cost of capital. The absence of sovereign yield curve is one of the leading factors that is holding back bond issuance from corporates in the region. As the GCC countries take a step towards establishing a yield curve, we might witness sharp surge in domestic corporate issuance subsequently.[:]]]></Content>

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">
<div style="text-align: left;">

<strong>This article was first published in Islamic Finance <em>news</em> Volume 15 Issue 18 dated the 1st May 2018.</strong>

The sukuk segment of the Islamic financial industry, witnessed a lot of activity in 2017. There was a global sale of nearly USD 100 bn in sukuk which increased the amount raised by 40% from 2016 as there was sustained growth in the GCC region along with the continuation in non-Islamic markets like U.K and Australia and entry by new markets like Nigeria. While this can be seen as positive development in the global sukuk market, corporate sukuks present a slight cause of concern. There has been a decline in the number of issuances when compared to the number of issuances of sovereign sukuk. Majority of sukuk issued in 2017 were by sovereigns and financial institutions (around 63%).

There has been a similar trend in the GCC region which has seen a decrease in the number of issuances of corporate bonds (which make up around 36% of the GCC sukuk market) from 9 in 2016 worth USD 1.73 bn to 5 in 2017 worth USD 3.66 bn. This increase in capital can be attributed to the issuance of Saudi Aramco sukuk bond (USD 3 bn). Although there was substantial interest shown by the corporates towards sukuk issuances in the past, there appears to be a wane in preference of sukuk as preferred option to access the debt capital markets. Through this note, we have tried to assess the potential reasons that have stopped corporate from issuing sukuks.

<strong>Underdeveloped Regulatory Framework</strong>
The need for strong legal and regulatory frameworks is essential for a continued development of bond market. While the Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institution (AAOIFI) develops Shariah rules which are mostly followed in GCC, they may not necessarily be accepted by other countries such as Malaysia. However, this could be a contradiction. With the absence of a global central body which can enforce standard laws to be followed among all countries, there is a lack of agreement among Shariah scholars on sukuk structure which create confusion among investors as to which sukuk are Shariah complaint and which are not. Companies such as Beximco Pharma had tried to take advantage by filing a case of non-compliance under Shariah law after defaulting against the agreement of sukuk. This undermines the trust in the corporate sukuk which leads to lower demand. A positive step in this area would be to standardize the process and laws for issuing sukuk.

<strong>Decreased Investor Confidence</strong>
Many investors were left puzzled when <a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/dana-gass-sukuk-a-trail-of-tribulations/">Dana gas</a> declared that its two sukuk bonds, having a net value of USD 700 mn was Shariah non-complaint under UAE’s law and had subsequently stopped payments on the sukuk. This news was not received well among the bondholders who dumped the sukuk for which it lost over 13% in the latter half of 2017. There were concerns that other issuers could break their commitment of payment on the grounds of sukuk not being Shariah complaint. Further proposal by Dana Gas Company to exchange the sukuk for new instruments did not sit well with bondholders as profits earned would be less than half of the existing one. With no resolution in place, this issue has led to decreased investor confidence in companies. They feared for the loss of capital invested with minimal or no return and hence are hesitant to further investment. And this has not been the first time such an issue had occurred as Investment Dar, a Kuwaiti company similarly contradicted a transaction with BLOM bank for breaching Shariah law in 2009. Such occurrences of non-compliance do not bode well for investment in corporate sukuks.

<strong>Complex Nature of Instrument </strong>
Sukuk are complex finance instruments. An issuance of sukuk depends on many factors such as assessing the market capacity for transaction, issuance cost, level of preparation for legal and regulatory environment for sukuk issuance, identification of appropriate sukuk assets as well as finalizing the structure of the sukuk. An issuing body issues a conventional bond in only few hours or a maximum of few days due to availability of standardized documents for issuance after reaching a decision to issue. For sukuk, the issuing body has to evaluate the issuing market for legal compliance, identify appropriate asset and structure for sukuk, consider all reviews from Shariah scholars and implement them for Shariah compliance, finalize documents and issue the sukuk in the market. It might take few weeks to few years for the sukuk to be bought by the investors as they are few in numbers. This might have led to loss in opportunity for the company for which it was raising capital in the first place by raising sukuks. Issuance of sukuks requires patience and an investment in time and resources which corporates may not be inclined to do so.

<strong>Absence of Benchmarks</strong>
In the past, there was no major benchmark for sukuks in the GCC region. Due to the absence of benchmark for sukuk, there was no practical means to measure the risk attached as well as to cite price for a particular sukuk in terms of its spread. This provided investors with very less information about the sukuks in terms of investment. A positive step towards this was the inclusion of sukuk in certain private index such as Emerging Markets Bond Index (EMBI), which might lead to enhancement in trading in the secondary market and increase demand for the issuance of new sukuks.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>
Although the sukuk markets have a positive vibe, there are certain factors which can impede the growth of the sukuk market. Underdeveloped legal and regulatory framework, complexity of sukuks and decreased investor confidence might meet with reluctance by investors in investing in the sukuk market. Recognising the seriousness of the issue, governments in the region have undertaken steps to make it more attractive. Improved laws for more standardization and inclusion in certain index will definitely help in the growth of sukuk markets and may facilitate trading in the secondary market.

<strong>Underdeveloped Regulatory Framework</strong>
The need for strong legal and regulatory frameworks is essential for a continued development of bond market. While the Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institution (AAOIFI) develops Shariah rules which are mostly followed in GCC, they may not necessarily be accepted by other countries such as Malaysia. However, this could be a contradiction. With the absence of a global central body which can enforce standard laws to be followed among all countries, there is a lack of agreement among Shariah scholars on sukuk structure which create confusion among investors as to which sukuk are Shariah complaint and which are not. Companies such as Beximco Pharma had tried to take advantage by filing a case of non-compliance under Shariah law after defaulting against the agreement of sukuk. This undermines the trust in the corporate sukuk which leads to lower demand. A positive step in this area would be to standardize the process and laws for issuing sukuk.

<strong>Decreased Investor Confidence</strong>
Many investors were left puzzled when <a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/dana-gass-sukuk-a-trail-of-tribulations/">Dana gas</a> declared that its two sukuk bonds, having a net value of USD 700 mn was Shariah non-complaint under UAE’s law and had subsequently stopped payments on the sukuk. This news was not received well among the bondholders who dumped the sukuk for which it lost over 13% in the latter half of 2017. There were concerns that other issuers could break their commitment of payment on the grounds of sukuk not being Shariah complaint. Further proposal by Dana Gas Company to exchange the sukuk for new instruments did not sit well with bondholders as profits earned would be less than half of the existing one. With no resolution in place, this issue has led to decreased investor confidence in companies. They feared for the loss of capital invested with minimal or no return and hence are hesitant to further investment. And this has not been the first time such an issue had occurred as Investment Dar, a Kuwaiti company similarly contradicted a transaction with BLOM bank for breaching Shariah law in 2009. Such occurrences of non-compliance do not bode well for investment in corporate sukuks.

<strong>Complex Nature of Instrument </strong>
Sukuk are complex finance instruments. An issuance of sukuk depends on many factors such as assessing the market capacity for transaction, issuance cost, level of preparation for legal and regulatory environment for sukuk issuance, identification of appropriate sukuk assets as well as finalizing the structure of the sukuk. An issuing body issues a conventional bond in only few hours or a maximum of few days due to availability of standardized documents for issuance after reaching a decision to issue. For sukuk, the issuing body has to evaluate the issuing market for legal compliance, identify appropriate asset and structure for sukuk, consider all reviews from Shariah scholars and implement them for Shariah compliance, finalize documents and issue the sukuk in the market. It might take few weeks to few years for the sukuk to be bought by the investors as they are few in numbers. This might have led to loss in opportunity for the company for which it was raising capital in the first place by raising sukuks. Issuance of sukuks requires patience and an investment in time and resources which corporates may not be inclined to do so.

<strong>Absence of Benchmarks</strong>
In the past, there was no major benchmark for sukuks in the GCC region. Due to the absence of benchmark for sukuk, there was no practical means to measure the risk attached as well as to cite price for a particular sukuk in terms of its spread. This provided investors with very less information about the sukuks in terms of investment. A positive step towards this was the inclusion of sukuk in certain private index such as Emerging Markets Bond Index (EMBI), which might lead to enhancement in trading in the secondary market and increase demand for the issuance of new sukuks.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>
Although the sukuk markets have a positive vibe, there are certain factors which can impede the growth of the sukuk market. Underdeveloped legal and regulatory framework, complexity of sukuks and decreased investor confidence might meet with reluctance by investors in investing in the sukuk market. Recognising the seriousness of the issue, governments in the region have undertaken steps to make it more attractive. Improved laws for more standardization and inclusion in certain index will definitely help in the growth of sukuk markets and may facilitate trading in the secondary market.

‘Index inclusion’ is perceived as a landmark event in the capital market history and the recent news of  Kuwait upgrade to FTSE Emerging Market (EM) Index & possible inclusion of Saudi Arabia into MSCI EM Index has attracted significant attention and generated much fanfare. The act of market indices being included or successfully upgraded from one category to another is often an outcome of series of reforms that results in establishment of a reliable market system which builds investor confidence and subsequently attracts foreign capital. Historically, countries have seemed to gain with index inclusion in terms of market performance, liquidity and foreign inflows.

Among GCC countries, in 2014, UAE and Qatar were upgraded to the MSCI EM index following which the net foreign inflows into the equity market of UAE and Qatar stood at USD 300mn and USD 2,482mn, respectively.

<br clear="all" /> <strong>Liquidity improved for both UAE & Qatar in the year of Index Inclusion</strong>

Source: Reuters, Marmore Research; Note: Turnover ratio is used to represent market liquidity
However, the increase in liquidity following the index inclusion process has largely been ephemeral as the liquidity levels consequently dropped. Thus, we believe generating sustained interest in the markets through various reforms, higher earnings growth, enhanced corporate announcements, fresh listings and introduction of new investment products would be crucial in ensuring higher liquidity.

<strong>Liquidity in GCC Stock markets – Perennially Low</strong>
The equity capital markets in the GCC region have been characterised by low levels of liquidity for many years. Factors like large scale government ownership of companies, restrictions on foreign ownership, legal and administrative problems, information asymmetry have all contributed to very low participation in equity markets leading to low trading volumes and hence low liquidity levels. The turnover ratio (calculated as total traded value in a year/average market capitalization), a measure of market liquidity, is low for the GCC region with average level in the last 10 years standing at 65% as against the global average which ranges from 102%-162%(World Bank). Further, the liquidity of GCC markets has slumped to a historic low of 30% in 2017. Wide variations in market liquidity have also been witnessed; for instance, liquidity in Bahrain markets has been in low single digits in stark contrast to other markets such as Saudi Arabia.

<strong>Could index inclusion revive market fortunes?</strong>
In the recent past, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have been promoted to ‘Secondary Emerging Market’ status by FTSE, which will be effective from September, 2018 and March, 2019 respectively. Saudi Arabia is set to have an index weight in FTSE Global Equity Index Series (GEIS) of 0.25% and 2.7% in the FTSE Emerging Index. The inclusion of Saudi Arabia is expected to bring USD 5.5bn in inflows as Saudi Arabian stocks are added by fund managers according to its allocated weight in the index. Also, the Saudi Aramco IPO upon successful listing would significantly increase the Kingdom’s weightage. Every USD 10bn of capital raised increases the expected weight of Saudi Arabia in the FTSE EM Index by an estimated 24 basis points. Assuming a 5% float and an IPO market capitalization of USD 100bn, Saudi Arabia’s weight could rise to 4.6% of the FTSE EM Index and to 6.6% of the index excluding China, matching Russia and surpassing Thailand and Mexico(FTSE Russell).

Due to the size of Saudi Arabia in the Emerging Index, FTSE Russell will implement its inclusion in four tranches to ensure mechanisms are operating as expected, thereby minimizing price fluctuations on the new constituents. Kuwait is to have an index weight of 0.04% in the FTSE Global Equity and 0.40% in the FTSE Emerging Index. The inclusion will be implemented in two tranches in the September, 2018 semi-annual review and December, 2018 quarterly review. The inclusion is likely to result in passive inflows of nearly USD 800mn into Kuwaiti stocks. These announcements have benefited Saudi Arabia and Kuwaiti stocks which have rallied 10% and 3.5% so far in the year while developed markets have largely fell.

<strong>Kuwait & KSA have witnessed sustained capital market Reforms </strong>
Both these nations have been undertaking reforms in their capital markets in the years prior to being promoted. These reform measures themselves can be responsible for increasing liquidity. Saudi Arabia opened its stock market to foreign investment on June 15, 2015 repealing policies that had earlier limited direct investment in shares of listed companies by foreign investors. Rules for QFI (Qualified Foreign Investor) were simplified in January, 2018 which in addition to the introduction of short selling and new corporate governance rules led to increased foreign institutional participation. All these reforms would increase liquidity in Saudi Arabian bourses.
Boursa Kuwait has issued a new rulebook which has specified a new segmentation of the market into three new markets, Premier Market, Main Market, and Auction Markets. A new set of Indices was also announced. The Premier Market would contain the larger and more liquid listed companies making it easier for investors to identify such companies. These companies may see more investor interest and share price increases. This classification will also incentivize companies with low liquidity levels to take steps to get promoted to premier status and benefit from it as a result.

<strong>What does inclusion in global indices like FTSE and MSCI mean?</strong>
Inclusion in global indexes like FTSE EM and MSCI EM indexes would bring the spotlight on markets leading to enhanced liquidity and increased capital inflow. Index inclusion increases investor awareness of country stocks leading to higher trading volumes. Also, the increasing popularity of passive investing has led to many global funds offering index funds which mimic global indexes like the MSCI EM index. When a country is included in these indexes, portfolio rebalancing by index funds leads to an increase in demand for the company’s stocks which increases trading volumes and also share prices.

Studies have indicated that when emerging markets are included in global indices, there is greater integration with the global financial markets resulting in risk sharing between local and foreign investors(Research Papers in Economics (RePEc)). This leads to a fall in equity risk premium and lowers the cost of capital thereby drawing new and additional investors resulting in increasing trading volumes. The share prices too go up as a result drawing even more investors and a virtuous cycle develops.

<strong>What is in store for the future?</strong>
Both these countries, Kuwait & Saudi Arabia, are now trying to get included in the MSCI Emerging Markets index to which USD 1.6 trillion worth of assets are being benchmarked. Inclusion in this index would lead to more foreign inflows and serve as a shot in the arm for boosting liquidity. MSCI is expected to make its decision on Saudi Arabia in June, 2018 and if it decides to include Saudi Arabia, then additional passive inflows to the tune of USD 10bn are expected. As Kuwait and Saudi Arabia undertake further reforms in their capital markets to comply with MSCI requirements, apart from the index inclusion being a boost to liquidity and share prices, the reforms themselves along with higher earnings growth, enhanced investment options due to new business listings and introduction of new products would go a long way in solving the problem of low liquidity and in attracting capital inflows into the market on a sustained basis.

		<Title>[:en]Debt Management Offices in GCC - A great institutional step[:ar]مكاتب إدارة الديون في دول مجلس التعاون الخليجي – خطوة مؤسسية كبيرة[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">
<div style="text-align: left;">

GCC governments have been active in setting up Debt Management Offices (DMO) in order to better understand and service their debt obligations<strong>. </strong>Hitherto, the role of issuing debt, servicing them and repaying them were all taken care of by the respective central banks. While that might have worked when the debt were minimal, a specialist DMO is required in order to manage them by establishing a separate, independent entity that is in charge of the debt management to avoid the burden on the central banks. GCC countries have established a Debt Management Office (DMO) that is independent but act according to the limits set by the finance ministry. DMO and treasury act in a co-ordinated manner and their collaboration relieves the central bank of such duties and it could concentrate on its most important functions.

In the GCC region, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and Saudi Arabia have set up their debt management offices in order to perform the cash management functions of the government. They take care of the cash requirements of the government; borrowing funds when there is a shortfall and placing the funds when they have a surplus. In the larger sense, the DMO functions as the executive arm of the treasury/central bank of these governments. Each of these offices is structured differently and has various levels of roles and responsibilities. The governments of the region have also been very eager to raise funds from international markets, taking advantage of the prevailing low interest rates globally.

<strong>The Dubai Debt Management Office</strong>

The Dubai DMO works under the supervision of the Dubai Supreme Fiscal Committee. One of the main objectives is to provide financial support and liquidity to government projects in support of the Financial Strategic Plan which has the objective of promoting economic development in the Emirate. The debt management division effectively has two sections an investor relation section and an operations section. The overall DMO falls under the purview of the Director General of the Government of Dubai’s Department of Finance.

<strong>Roles & Responsibility of DMO</strong>

<strong>Saudi Arabia Debt Management Office</strong>

The Saudi Arabia Debt Management Office was established in the fourth quarter of 2015 following the decline in oil prices and the government’s intention to raise funds in its domestic and international market. The DMO was established with the objective of securing funds for the short, medium and long term finance needs within a pre-established risk framework. Saudi Arabia DMO is bequeathed with other responsibilities as well, such as managing the direct and contingent liabilities of the government, developing a medium term debt strategy, arranging, leading and issuing public debt in all forms (both local and international borrowing), developing the legal frameworks, governance, risk management policies that is related to public debt management.

<strong>Kuwait Debt Management Office</strong>

Kuwait has been the most recent country among the GCC nations to setup a debt management unit under Ministry of Finance and has been recently been noted down as a key reform measure by Moody’s that would help the country in the long-run.

In countries that have a dedicated office for debt management, the DMO comes under the purview of the department of finance. DMOs in the GCC region should have to take into consideration that too much public debt with local banks could result in crowding-out of credit to the private sector. Alternatively, government debt issuance could facilitate deepening of the local capital markets, diversifying funding sources and benchmarking the yield curve for corporate financing (GCC Surveillance Paper).

<strong>Why setting up a DMO is necessary for GCC countries now?</strong>

Until 2014, GCC countries did not face any significant funding gaps, and they didn’t have the need to develop any expertise in public debt management – until the steep fall in oil prices caused fiscal deficits, as the government had to borrow more than the revenues it received from oil receipts. Since then, the oil market has undergone a lot of turmoil which has resulted in a significant change in the way the debt has started to form an essential part of the GCC government funds. In the initial phases a lot of the government debt that was issued was absorbed by the local banks. However, most GCC governments took cognisance of the fact that parking too much of the issuances with local banks were crowding out the private sector and started going for international issuances.

With more funds expected to be raised using bond issuances route, it is of vital importance that GCC countries have a specialist organization that would be looking into the debt issuances and managing them instead of the central banks. In this regard, IMF provides certain action points on how to achieve them. In fact, in 2016 they had helped Saudi Arabia to help setup a DMO for managing future borrowing and Issuances.
<ul>
 	<li>Establish a DMO under the Ministry of Finance that would be responsible for developing the legal, governance, and risk management frameworks for debt management;</li>
 	<li>Develop a medium-term debt strategy to properly assess the trade-offs of alternative debt strategies in light of the expected fiscal deficits over the medium term; and</li>
 	<li>Promote debt management policies and practices that facilitate local debt market development, such as using auctions as issuance mechanisms and adopting efficient communication channels with market participants.</li>
 	<li>Give regular updates in about the debt issuances, open market operations, auction schedules in both English and Arabic</li>
 	<li>Perform regular conference calls with investors to address investor concerns.</li>
</ul>
Implement a strict timeline for addressing the query of investors.

		<Title>[:en]GCC Companies: High Cash Holdings and Shareholder Returns[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]Investors look at various parameters to understand and evaluate a company’s attractiveness. One such item in the balance sheet is the level of cash that a company holds. If the cash balance has been consistently growing, it is generally considered to be a good indicator that the company is performing well and is therefore able to accumulate cash reserves on its balance sheet. However, it is essential to determine the cause behind growth in cash flow and reason for holding high cash balance before concluding whether it is good or bad for the company and its shareholders.

<a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/gcc-listed-companies-with-high-cash-holding/"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2660 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GCC-cash-leaders_Blog-Ads.jpg" alt="GCC Listed Companies with high cash holding – what can one learn?" width="800" height="179" /></a>

In our report <a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/gcc-listed-companies-with-high-cash-holding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GCC Listed Companies with high cash holding</a> – what can one learn we evaluated GCC’s cash leaders i.e., companies in GCC with very high levels of cash. We identified various sources/reasons that caused them to be the cash leaders and explored if there is a link between high cash holding and shareholder returns.

In the coveted list, capital expenditure was the primary source of cash outflows. In addition, consistent dividend payment by majority of the companies was also one of the key source of cash outflows. In contrast, growth in profitability, debt issuance, sale of assets and maturity of investments were the leading sources of cash inflows.

For instance, Qatar Fuel Company, which has the highest cash balance in proportion to its total assets, has spent cash on investment activities over the last five years. Etisalat, the largest telecom player in UAE and second largest in GCC by market cap, had the highest cash to assets ratio among GCC telecom players on average. Its high cash balance particularly in 2018 was due to lower cash outflow as a result of lower term deposits (with maturity of over 3 months) as compared to previous year and proceeds from sale of subsidiary and associates. Slowdown in real estate sector in Dubai in past couple of years affected the cash balance of real estate companies. Both Emaar and Aldar properties have registered a decline in cash balance of 63% and 44% respectively as of Jun-2019 compared to 2017 levels. Aldar properties in particular saw a decline in their profitability during this period. However, they still make it to the top 10 in our analysis.

<strong>GCC companies with high cash holdings as % of assets</strong>
<img class="alignleft wp-image-2656 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Cash-holdings-in-GCC-Marmore-Fig1.jpg" alt="GCC companies with high cash holdings as % of assets" width="675" height="558" />
<span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #696969; font-size: 10px;">Source: Reuters, Marmore research, as of 23, Sep 2019 | Cash holdings and cash to asset are for period 2014-H1 2019</span>

All the companies in our coveted list have a much higher cash holdings as compared to their respective sectoral average. Majority of the companies have yielded either negative or low positive returns to the shareholders (for more details refer our report). Few exceptions were Etisalat and Dana gas that have yielded high returns to the shareholders. One of the reason behind the surge in the stock price of Etisalat was due to synergies from the acquisition of 53% stake in Maroc Telecom (~USD 5.7bn) in cash in 2014, which was one of the largest cross border deals in the region. Further, during the year 2015, Etisalat was one of the constituents that was included in the MSCI index upon UAE’s EM upgradation. The share price of Etisalat surged by 61.7% in 2015 alone.

In the aftermath of financial crisis followed by recent oil price crisis, the importance of holding liquid assets have been growing across globe and even more so in GCC region which has significant exposure to oil prices. However as holding cash has opportunity cost associated; in case of dearth of attractive investment opportunities companies have other alternatives to utilize their cash balance. Investors generally look for stocks that pay dividends and companies that share excess cash with shareholders in the form of dividends are likely to experience better share prices as compared to non-dividend paying stocks. Holding cash over and above the desired levels may ultimately be perceived as inefficient utilization of resources and therefore companies with high level of cash holdings for long periods may underperform compared to their potential intrinsic value when cash is well utilized.[:]]]></Content>

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">
<div style="text-align: left;">As a part of its broader economic diversification plans, Saudi Arabia took an unprecedented policy move by framing a new entertainment policy. In line with the Kingdom’s Vision of 2030 of creating a vibrant society, General Entertainment Authority (GEA) has been established and an investment of US$ 64 Bn has been planned (BBC News 2018). GEA is part of the subprogram, Quality of Life under the Vision 2030 which aims for improving lifestyle by increasing entertainment and cultural avenues.</div>
</div>
Entertainment policy area witnessed sudden jerk in recent times in Saudi Arabia, because a formal institution (GEA) overlooking entertainment industry with broad and clear objectives took shape. It signifies role of entrainment and culture in economic diversification and how it can impact auxiliary sectors such as tourism, construction, entertainment, parks and establishments in the economy.

<strong>Factors backing for Formalization of Policy</strong>
Firstly role of private sector in Saudi Arabian entertainment industry is small (mostly non-existent) thus huge initial public investment worth US$ 64 bn is being offered by the Government for development of entertainment sector. Secondly, nationals currently spend billions of dollars annually for entertainment purposes in neighbouring countries which causes massive outflows of money from the country (New York Times, 2018), authorities think can be prevented. Finally, Vision 2030 aspires to grow household spending on entertainment from current 2.9% to 6% which is expected to develop a SAR 30 Bn market (Ibid). (US$ 8 Bn) Vision 2030 has three thematic flavours, a vibrant society, a thriving economy, and an ambitious nation where policymakers (for Vibrant Society theme) are focused for the promotion of physical, psychological social well-being of every citizen (General Entertainment Authority Website).

Myriad economic and social issues are associated with Vision 2030 and its sub-programs like Quality of Life. These programs are initially driven by huge public investment (essentially construction led) and aspires to attract private capital in the later stage, (as sector develops) but policy as a whole misses certain critical issues (which might act as an impediment) such as availability of adequate labour, technical expertise, ability of domestic private sector to take off as expected under the plan and what would be the socio-cultural response to such herculean modernization programs.

<strong>Potential Socio-Economic Impact</strong>

The Policy aims to perfectly address the problems that were associated with cultural and social life in Saudi Arabia; which naturally stretches beyond economic diversification and employment creation. Earlier there was an apparent lack of a platform for cinema and theatre for utilizing talent, an absence of avenues for cultural, entertainment and leisure activities. Moreover, there was an absence of institutions and bodies promoting arts, cultural and sporting activities.

Cinemas, theatre and arts are social and economic necessities; primarily because of their consumption value and additionally because employment it creates, the technology it utilizes and thereby accelerator effect that it sets in.

On this account, the GEA is entrusted with host duties for expansion of the entertainment sector. GEA acts as the licencing authority and designated authority for setting standards and implementing plans. This helps in augmenting investments and talent in desired channels for the development of the sector. Additionally, GEA is mandated to encourage investments and promote collaboration and deliberations between different government and private agencies (General Entertainment Authority Website, 2018). These two are the critical functions of the agency, because it provides the unified and independent platform for cooperation across organizations and firms.

<strong>Big Push to Private Sector</strong>
The crux of this mega policy is the intertwined benefits of promoting entertainment, sports, leisure, health sectors and strengthening the private sector thus create more sustainable job opportunities. In the current backdrop of crawling private sector; as business conditions improved at the slowest pace for nearly last nine years as Saudi Arabia Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rounded off to weakest quarter recorded since March 2009 (Arabian Business News Website 2018), entertainment policy acts as a big boon in a sense that it attracts huge private investment.

Public Investment Fund (PIF) is actively involved in the Qiddiya project with a commitment of SA 10 Bn (Quality of Life Document) and at the broader level the fund is at the forefront of diversification plans in line with Vision 2035. The Private sector is expecting a strong return on investments based on business-friendly environment and strong social demand (for entertainment) in the country. Liberal stand by the government on private (domestic and international) investments in the sector is creating a host of lucrative avenues.

Private investments are set to thrive and policy aims seem fairly achievable given that fact that delivery mechanism (for the policy) tends to be more private oriented.  On the other hand, entertainment had been a long societal preference given the fact that Saudi nationals used to enthusiastically travel to neighbouring countries for the purpose of entertainment and leisure activities.

<strong>Potential Investment Opportunities</strong>
Construction has already began for the new Entertainment City near capital Riyadh (Qiddiya Project-an entertainment, sports and cultural destination). GEA expects that during the next two years, Quality of Life generates 300,000 jobs and most of in the private sector. (First Abu Dhabi Bank Markets Insights 2018)

Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund and Six Flags (US based entertainment corporation) agreed to build a new city focusing on theme parks, wheels and wings, scenic and animal encounters, water and snow sports, education, culture and host of other events (Gulf State Analytics website 2018). With respect to the development of Cinemas in the country, the construction industry is expected to see a robust growth in the years ahead because the Saudi Government plans to build approximately 2,000 cinemas in 13 regions  of Saudi Arabia.

Furthermore, according to latest statistics around 500 entertainment companies established during 2017 created as much as 22,000 job opportunities (Invest Saudi 2018). Moreover, the retail sector (especially malls) are likely to be buoyed by the new entertainment policy, as more and more cinemas will most probably be constructed in large malls. For example, Saudi Arabia’s biggest mall operator, Arabian Centre, has allocated space for cinemas in 10 of its upcoming malls (Arabian Business 2018). Development of theme parks, opera houses, concert places, resorts, museums, art galleries, and theatres could be a catapult for the economy leading to growth in sectors such as tourism, hospitality, associated public transportation, etc.

Finally, the biggest impact is expected to be in the technology sector. For example, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is helping in writing scripts with complete stage instructions for a science fiction movie. Moreover, Immersive technologies (virtual reality, augmented reality) are becoming cheaper and it could herald a new era into content (World Economic Forum Creative Disruption 2018), media, film industry, entertainment, amusement parks in Saudi Arabia with its wide applications. These hold promise of allowing a creative industries ecosystem to develop and thrive in the Kingdom as a long-term consequence of the current policy posture.

Development of proposed parks and entertainment zones will be able to utilize current and upcoming technological developments and can deliver more robust growth. In summary, it can be said that entertainment policy and its objectives of creating a vibrant society in Saudi Arabia, is a step that will push entertainment, technological sector, cultural tourism and other sectors to greater levels of advancement in the years ahead.[:ar]<div style="text-align: justify;">

Furthermore, according to latest statistics around 500 entertainment companies established during 2017 created as much as 22,000 job opportunities (Invest Saudi 2018). Moreover, the retail sector (especially malls) are likely to be buoyed by the new entertainment policy, as more and more cinemas will most probably be constructed in large malls. For example, Saudi Arabia’s biggest mall operator, Arabian Centre, has allocated space for cinemas in 10 of its upcoming malls (Arabian Business 2018). Development of theme parks, opera houses, concert places, resorts, museums, art galleries, and theatres could be a catapult for the economy leading to growth in sectors such as tourism, hospitality, associated public transportation, etc.

Finally, the biggest impact is expected to be in the technology sector. For example, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is helping in writing scripts with complete stage instructions for a science fiction movie. Moreover, Immersive technologies (virtual reality, augmented reality) are becoming cheaper and it could herald a new era into content (World Economic Forum Creative Disruption 2018), media, film industry, entertainment, amusement parks in Saudi Arabia with its wide applications. These hold promise of allowing a creative industries ecosystem to develop and thrive in the Kingdom as a long-term consequence of the current policy posture.

Development of proposed parks and entertainment zones will be able to utilize current and upcoming technological developments and can deliver more robust growth. In summary, it can be said that entertainment policy and its objectives of creating a vibrant society in Saudi Arabia, is a step that will push entertainment, technological sector, cultural tourism and other sectors to greater levels of advancement in the years ahead.[:]]]></Content>

The Arab nations have been under the limelight ever since Egypt, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia and Morocco qualified for the FIFA World Cup 2018, the first time in history where four teams from the region will be competing in the global event. The efforts taken by Arab nations have started to pay dividends as they see the emergence of sports in the region. Acknowledging the potential of the sports tourism market, focus has been laid on bringing global events to the region and also in the development of sporting infrastructure. Qatar sent ripples across the sporting industry when it won the right to host the FIFA 2022 World Cup in 2010. Since then, sports have come a long way gaining prominence across the region.

<strong>Arab nations – Witnessing progress</strong>
Arab nations are increasingly aware of the importance of developing sports in their country. They have dedicated a part of their budget towards infrastructure development of sporting facilities and also recognized sports as a key component in their national visions moving forward. This has resulted in several new teams emerging across the countries and showing promise in several sports. Despite not winning major honors, there has been a stark improvement in terms of their global rankings.

<strong>Highest Ranked Sport for GCC Nations</strong>

Major strides have been made in the world of football. The 2018 FIFA World Cup will be of historic significance for Arab football as four teams have secured a place to compete in the final stages of the competition for the first time.

<strong>Arab Teams that have qualified for the FIFA World Cup</strong>

Vast improvement has also been seen in cricket as the UAE cricket team qualified for the 2015 Cricket World Cup ahead of several other associate nations and put on spirited performances against the giants of the game. The UAE is currently in Division Two and will be competing with 9 other teams to secure the final two spots in the 2019 Cricket World Cup. Oman’s cricket team is another upcoming promising team which is currently playing in Division Three.

<strong>Sports Tourism – A new avenue for GCC Countries</strong>
GCC countries are trying to position themselves as leading sports tourism destinations on a global scale by hosting several global events. Sports tourism is a potential growth driver for economies with the value of the world sports tourism being valued at nearly USD 600 bn (World Travel Market). Sports accounted for 25% of all tourism receipts globally, with 76% of trips, planned around a sporting event in 2016 (World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC)). The GCC countries have been looking to tap into this market and have recognized sports as a key focus area as part of their diversification plans.

Most notably, Qatar turned everyone’s eye in 2010 by securing the rights to host the FIFA Football World Cup 2022 beating bids from the USA, Japan, Australia and South Korea.  Qatar, the richest country per capita placed the bid at the center of its national and foreign policy strategy. Hosting one of the biggest sporting spectacles brings immense international and domestic recognition while also providing economic and diplomatic opportunities. A budget of USD 7bn has been pledged to develop sporting facilities for the event, which include the construction of sports stadiums and renovation of old ones. In 2017, French football club Paris Saint-Germain backed by Qatari owners obliterated the existing world transfer fee record by purchasing the Brazilian footballer Neymar from FC Barcelona at USD 263mn, usurping the previous record by nearly 125%.

The UAE is also committed to be a prime sporting destination in the region. Dubai and Abu Dhabi frequently stage notable international events in Formula 1, Tennis, Cricket and several other sports. The additional visitor numbers generated from these events such as the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix and Dubai World Cup will contribute towards achieving the country’s bold plans to attract 20 million visitors to Dubai by 2020 and 7.5 million to Abu Dhabi under its 2030 plans. The Abu Dhabi Grand Prix has been a part of the Formula One calendar for the past 7 years becoming one of the biggest sporting events in the country. Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships, Dubai Rugby 7s, Dubai World Cup for horse racing are other key events taking place in the UAE. Sheikh Mansour, the deputy prime minister of the UAE owns City Football Group, consisting of Manchester City F.C, Melbourne City F.C and New York City F.C, some of the best football clubs in their respective leagues.

Bahrain has been the home for a major sporting event, the Bahrain Grand Prix for 13 years. Additionally, Bahrain’ Supreme Council for Youth & Sports is planning to build a multisport stadium with the capability to host major events in football, basketball, handball, bowling, badminton and table tennis.

<strong>Where are they heading to?</strong>
Seeing the amount of funds pledged for developing sporting infrastructure and attracting global sporting events, the signs for sports development in the region look promising. Development of facilities with international standards will aid grassroots development which is the base for producing successful athletes and teams. These changes are expected to further enhance the development of sports in the region and in all likelihood the days when Arab nations start challenging for major honors in the global arena are not far away.

		<Title>[:en]Gaming Market in the Middle East - Part2: Key trends in the Middle East gaming market[:ar]تسويق الرياضة في الشرق الأوسط – الجزء 2: الاتجاهات الرئيسية في سوق الرياضة بالشركة الأوسط[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">
<div style="text-align: left;">

As part of the gaming sector study in the GCC region we were able to find out some prominent trends in the GCC region that we have chronicled below. Some of the trends were not quite obvious before venturing into this blog. For example, piracy has been a primary reason behind the gaming culture in the region and even within the Middle East region there are significant differences in product distribution networks. Mobile gaming has been an important revenue generator in the region thanks to the high concentration of gaming whales in the region.

<strong>Censorship and strict rules does not diminish appeal of games</strong>
Some games were banned in the region on various grounds ranging from negative portrayal of the Middle East to usage of extreme violence. Games such as Battlefield 3, God of War, and Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and Grand Theft Auto (Series) have been banned but surprisingly their ban has only increased their popularity. These game titles have wide spread followers in the region despite the negative portrayal of the Middle East region, albeit in a highly fictionalized environment. The popularity of games such as Battlefield and Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare seems to stem from their plot, which revolve around the military forces taking on the terrorists in the region. Youngsters from the region claim that the existence of such video games lends them a safe avenue for letting their frustration out on terrorists; some gamers equate this to a cathartic experience. Patchy enforcement of the ban owing to very little communication among the relevant bodies result in prohibited games being available through other channels.

<strong>The irony of piracy – Once here, now on the way out</strong>
While it might be easy to generalize the trends across the countries - the cultural, regional and economical differences have played a key role in the development of gaming culture within their borders. For example, in the UAE, malls have been the major contributor to the popularity of video games. Specialist video game parlors, hypermarkets and even bookstores boast of offering latest games and consoles to their patrons. Contrast this with Iran and Egypt, which still depend on distributor, wholesaler and retailer model. The differences however has not diminished the popularity of gaming culture; for instance, Iran boasts of 25 Mn online gamers among which 2.5Mn are expert gamers. Unfortunately, piracy still dominates in the PC games market in the country and the only way to make money from Iran is through sale of gaming consoles, accessories and other gaming hardware.

Despite its negative effects, piracy has played a big role in gaming becoming a favorite activity in the region. While solid number are difficult to come by, estimates point out that over 99% of the games for PS2 were pirated in the region. The problem of piracy was exacerbated by the lack of unified and global release dates, which also encouraged the grey market. CDs and DVDs of games were imported from the US and the Europe and were sold in the Middle East market at a premium price.

Piracy has died down recently due to three factors - distributors and sellers in the region have made conscious efforts to curb piracy, harder to pirate games on consoles such as Sony’s PS4 and the growth of mobile gaming. However, piracy’s role in popularizing the gaming culture in the region cannot be understated.

In recent times, there has been a visible shift towards mobile games and this is rapidly eating into the share of gaming consoles. An advantage that mobile games have over the consoles is the ability to monetize the usage in a more efficient manner through micro transactions. Mobile games usually use the freemium approach, a user has a waiting period when he crosses a particular level, and the user can either pay a small fee to play the next level immediately or wait for the cool off period to continue the next level. Micro transactions have been the order of the day, the basic game is provided for free but people have to spend more on getting sophisticated weaponry, level up quickly, boost their damage recovery etc.  These games also come from controlled channels such as the Google Play Store or Apple’s App store, which are harder to pirate, as game servers are quick to recognize such attempts, and blocks them. Game developers also feel that selling the games as a piecemeal instead of a whole package bring constant stream of revenues.

<strong>Game development initiatives- from obscurity to mainstream</strong>
The development of gaming convention in the region points to some an important change in the region – Gaming industry is now being increasingly seen as a viable career instead of a favorite past time. Jordan’s Game Zanga holds contest for developing games within affixed time on an agreed theme, the prizes for these events range from cash prizes to lucrative contracts for game development. Over 300 developers in its recent iteration have attended this event organized by game development studio GameTako and over 50 games are created each year.

In addition to these events and convention, governments and private initiatives in the region are promoting the industry. The Saudi National Creative Initiative hosts an application and gaming week that aims at teaching design theories and how to transform an idea from concept to a complete live project. Turkey has a StartersHUB that organizes gaming convention each year in Istanbul. In Beirut, Arab Arcade organizes regular gaming sessions for gamers, developers, designers, artists to create new games within a certain period similar to Game Zanga.

<strong>Localization is starting to gain traction </strong>
The massively multiplier online (MMO) games were the first to embrace localization in the form of translating English text to Arabic. However, success of the first game MMO game, Travian came with heavy cost of increased advertisement spending. Sony was the first major developer to release “This is Football“ in Arabic for the PS2 platform. For some years, Sony was the only console producer with Arabic content. Despite the initial reluctance and the difficulties that they experienced in the region, global studios such as Valve and Ubisoft have invested handsomely in the region. Valve activated dedicated Middle Eastern servers live for games such as Dota 2, team Fortress 2 and Counter Strike: Global Offensive in 2014.  Ubisoft has a game development center in the region and works closely with Tadreeb, the training arm of the Abu Dhabi government media company twofour54 providing training course in gaming. The growth of mobile games were a key reason behind the entry to Ubisoft into the market. Activision Blizzard another large game developer have made tried entering the Middle East market through a series of acquisitions by buying well-managed and profitable local companies.

One example of the locally developed game is Unearthed: Trail of Ibn Battuta, a multi-platform game that allows the players to retrace the steps of legendary Arab explorer in a contemporary setting. Another example of local content that has witnessed great levels of success is from Lebanese developer Game Cooks who have two hits – Birdy Nam Nam (1.7 Mn downloads) and Run for Peace (1.6Mn downloads).

Two broad trends are emerging when it comes to localization in the region - the international game developers will look into translating their international releases into Arabic, FIFA released a version in Arabic featuring local Arabic soccer stars. Another major trend is the emergence of regional developers who are expected to come out with more contents for the local region. Jordan’s Maysalward, Lebanon’s Wixel Studios are good examples of regional developers who on few occasions have tasted success internationally as well.

<strong>Smartphone adoption has been a major force behind the increasing gaming revenues</strong>
Saudi Arabia and the UAE are increasingly important for the game developers of the world; youthful demography of the region is only partially responsible for it. The appeal for major gaming studios is the spending power that this younger generation possess. Cash-rich governments, ample social benefits and zero personal income tax results in higher disposable income, which these people can spend on areas of their liking. With other entertainment options limited in these countries, mobile game developers are capitalizing on this.

This strategy seems to be paying off so far. Saudi Arabia has a population of 30Mn, but that population generates approximately USD 350 million per year in revenues for mobile games. Most of that comes from a class of mega spending men and women (commonly called “whales”) that do not care if a game is localized as long as it’s trendy. To summarize the magnitude of the spending - A whopping 42 percent of total Saudi gamers pay for in-app purchases. Two-thirds pay less than $10 per month, which is what most other markets also witness, but there stops the similarity. The rest of gaming distribution is where most of the revenues comes from.  Among them 22 percent pay $10 to $50 and 11 percent pay $50 to $100 per month. The second most valuable category among them roughly make up four percent pay $100 to $500. The most valuable category of gamers form one percent pay up to $1000 per month and are fondly called “Killer Whales” by the game developers.

MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region surprisingly has turned into an important market for global game developers, publishers and distributors. However, despite all the prospects there are teething challenges that remain and that needs to be addressed.

		<Title>[:en]Gaming Market in the Middle East - Part 1:  A Cathartic Experience[:ar]سوق الرياضة في الشرق الأوسط – الجزء 1: تجربة تمهيدية[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">
<div style="text-align: left;">

Not many people would conjure up the image of the Middle East region when talking about video games and their growth in general. Wars and internal conflicts often overshadow the vibrant and growing market for video games in the region. Video game culture has been an offshoot of such conflicts – many youngsters find it a cathartic experience to win against the forces that have been responsible for wide spread conflicts in the region and admit that it is one of the most preferred form of entertainment for them.

Popularity of video games was driven in the region in large parts by Sony; its PlayStation platform has been instrumental in establishing the popularity of video games in the region. Teenagers and youngsters, especially from the GCC region, took their affection for games to higher levels with the introduction of Sony’s Playstation2 (PS2) in the year 2000. The popularity of the platform is still unfazed, it remains as the bestselling console in the Middle East region clocking overall sales of 5.2million units followed by the play station portable (PSP) at 1.5million units.

Another factor that has fuelled the growth of gaming culture has been the regional government’s censorship policies and strict religious views; both of these restrict the content that would be available through conventional channels such as TV, movies and theatre. Some of these restrictions have been in place to curb the growing Western influences in the region. While video games are also subjected to the same censorship rules, the implementation remains sketchy as there are conflicts related to the implementation of the ban. Certain video game titles are banned or censored if they are too visibly violating the region’s sensitivities towards religion, politics, geo-politics etc. Some of the gaming titles that were banned includes - Battlefield III, God of War, and Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and Grand Theft Auto (Series)

Youngsters in the GCC region also have higher purchasing power owing to generous government policies. As a result, lot of them have access to the latest technological gadgets including, mobile phones, tablets, gaming consoles and other high-end gaming accessories. They also spend more time on mediums like YouTube and Facebook and are constantly exposed to the latest news and developments surrounding games released in the Western markets. Studying Saudi Arabia’s YouTube viewership patterns provides taste of the regional preferences in these alternative channels. Saudi Arabia is the leader in the region for most video playbacks followed by Egypt, Morocco and finally UAE. There are 167 million video views every day only from the MENA region; Saudi Arabia alone generates 90 Million daily views making it one of the most lucrative markets for YouTube. The heightened viewership from Middle East results in free-flow of ideas on latest fashion trends, gaming lifestyle and western pop culture.

<strong>What is the size of the Middle East video game market?</strong>
Currently, there are over 587million online gamers in the Middle East region and the amount of time spent online is definitely starting to affect the gaming sector’s revenues from the region. Globally the video games market is a huge business, with estimated revenues of USD 109billion as of 2017 growing by 7.8% YoY. Middle East region alone accounts for 3.2% of that market generating close to USD 4bn in revenues and growing by 25% on a YoY basis. Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Iran and UAE are the top four countries generating revenues to the tune of USD 774million, USD 647mn, USD 431mn and USD 281mn respectively.

Revenue growth from MENA region is well ahead of markets such as Latin America (13.9%) and APAC (Asia Pacific, 9.2%); it also contrasts with larger markets where growth is stagnating - such as North America (just 4%) and Western Europe (4.8%).  Most of growth has been fuelled by the Egypt, the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Growth, especially in Egypt and Saudi Arabia, is largely fuelled by the growth in smartphones. Both these countries have some of the highest smartphone penetration in the world at 80.6% and 65.2% respectively. With such high penetration levels, this region itself has put itself on the radars’ of most game developers.

<strong>Government and private initiatives fuelling video-game development ecosystem</strong>
A cultural ecosystem surrounding gaming development is emerging in the Middle East, which is helping the growth of gaming in the region. Conventions, comic-cons and eSports are now common across the Middle East and they have been very instrumental in promoting the gaming culture in the region. Localization initiatives have also helped the market largely. Big gaming studios such as Sony, Valve and Ubisoft have been the most notable ones to have significant presence in the region.

<strong>Gaming events</strong>
The last few years has seen a boom of gaming and pop culture events around the Middle East. The events keep getting bigger and more lavish each time, attracting popular artists and celebrities from gaming, movies and TV shows, and are also becoming a hub for some of the biggest eSports tournaments in the region. In recent times, the region has hosted three major events – GAMES Middle East, Dubai World Game Expo and IGN convention Abu Dhabi

<strong>GAMES Middle East</strong>
GAMES is an alliance between Sony PlayStation Middle East, Microsoft Gulf, Red Entertainment and Pluto Games that provides fans and gamers access to upcoming games and technology, while hosting various tournaments, events and eSports competitions. It's the E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo) of the Middle East.

<strong>Dubai World Game Expo</strong>
Dubai World Game Expo (DWGE) is a platform for meeting with interactive entertainment developers, publishers, distributors, service providers, platform providers, localization providers, payment providers, multimedia, telecom operators, investors, government officials, and retailers in the MENA region. DWGE serves as an ideal venue to introduce a wide variety of video games, online games, mobile games, edutainment & infotainment software, game related hardware, and next-generation platforms.

<strong>IGN Convention Abu Dhabi</strong>
IGN convention is the region’s biggest film, video games, technology, and comic’s convention that features game enthusiasts and international celebrities. Fans will also get to interact with regional artists in Q&A sessions. This is all in addition to comic book and film events, including a cosplay competition, gaming announcements, discussion panels on movies and games, trivia quizzes, comic book stalls and a video game tournament.

In part two of the series, we would look at the key trends that are emerging in the Middle East region.

Not many people would conjure up the image of the Middle East region when talking about video games and their growth in general. Wars and internal conflicts often overshadow the vibrant and growing market for video games in the region. Video game culture has been an offshoot of such conflicts – many youngsters find it a cathartic experience to win against the forces that have been responsible for wide spread conflicts in the region and admit that it is one of the most preferred form of entertainment for them.

Popularity of video games was driven in the region in large parts by Sony; its PlayStation platform has been instrumental in establishing the popularity of video games in the region. Teenagers and youngsters, especially from the GCC region, took their affection for games to higher levels with the introduction of Sony’s Playstation2 (PS2) in the year 2000. The popularity of the platform is still unfazed, it remains as the bestselling console in the Middle East region clocking overall sales of 5.2million units followed by the play station portable (PSP) at 1.5million units.

Another factor that has fuelled the growth of gaming culture has been the regional government’s censorship policies and strict religious views; both of these restrict the content that would be available through conventional channels such as TV, movies and theatre. Some of these restrictions have been in place to curb the growing Western influences in the region. While video games are also subjected to the same censorship rules, the implementation remains sketchy as there are conflicts related to the implementation of the ban. Certain video game titles are banned or censored if they are too visibly violating the region’s sensitivities towards religion, politics, geo-politics etc. Some of the gaming titles that were banned includes - Battlefield III, God of War, and Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and Grand Theft Auto (Series)

Youngsters in the GCC region also have higher purchasing power owing to generous government policies. As a result, lot of them have access to the latest technological gadgets including, mobile phones, tablets, gaming consoles and other high-end gaming accessories. They also spend more time on mediums like YouTube and Facebook and are constantly exposed to the latest news and developments surrounding games released in the Western markets. Studying Saudi Arabia’s YouTube viewership patterns provides taste of the regional preferences in these alternative channels. Saudi Arabia is the leader in the region for most video playbacks followed by Egypt, Morocco and finally UAE. There are 167 million video views every day only from the MENA region; Saudi Arabia alone generates 90 Million daily views making it one of the most lucrative markets for YouTube. The heightened viewership from Middle East results in free-flow of ideas on latest fashion trends, gaming lifestyle and western pop culture. Comic con festivals, a staple among the western movies, comics and gaming aficionados came to Dubai in 2012;  a sign of large-scale convergence of tastes and preferences among the younger generation.

<div style="text-align: left;">

A residential house that is a shape of rotor with contemporary style with wooden flooring, furnished with appliances from Samsung, constructed within 24 hours. Imagine making an own range of jewelry, trinkets or tiny add-ons for daily lives. Can we craft sculptures or showpieces smaller than human hair? A custom prosthetic device such as a hearing aid or artificial human limbs and manufacture them at very affordable prices, which benefits the healthcare industry? A 400 square metre two- story villa with walls of thickness 250 mm, capable of withstanding a level eight earthquake on the Richter scale was built is 45 days.

Well, if you are thinking these structures created by employing huge workforce, then you are wrong. These are the wonders created by 3D printing.

<strong>What is 3D printing?</strong>
3D printing is a method of creating a three dimensional object from a digital file. It is a part of additive manufacturing (AM), where the materials are layered several times until the desired object is created. It starts with creation of blueprint of the desired object, using various 3D modelling software like Blenders or also on websites like Shapeways, Thingiverse that has objects created by other users. The finished design is sent to a 3D printer. The 3D printer reads the file blueprint to lay down into thin layers of material to create the desired 3D object. The materials used in creating the 3D product can vary from plastic to metals to ceramics.

<strong>Top 5 Advantages of 3D printing:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Ease of Customization:</strong> when there is mass production, all the parts in the assembly line uses same mold and shape, making it difficult to be exclusive. 3D printing allows us to customize, personalize the product by tweaking the prototype thus fitting to one’s needs. For instance, people can make their own jewelry or fashion or print your own wardrobe.</li>
 	<li><strong>Time efficient:</strong> with the fast-paced life, we require everything quick and so 3D printing can make a huge difference. With 3D print a concept can transform to reality in a day, shrinks the developmental process from months to days. For example, the time to build houses has shrunken from years to months or days with 3D printing technology.</li>
 	<li><strong>Reduce costs</strong>: manufacturers can produce products on demand rather than in large runs, improving inventory management and reducing warehouse space. The labour costs are significantly low, as the whole process is automated and demands only an operator to start the machine. In medical field, prosthetic hands can be created in few hundred dollars making it accessible to patients.</li>
 	<li><strong>Risk reduction:</strong>  The manufacturer would always want to test the product design before producing it in large numbers or before investing in an expensive molding tool. Using 3D printing the products can be printed far cheaper than redesign or alter the existing mold.</li>
 	<li><strong>Sustainability: </strong>3D printing has multipurpose characteristics, less wastage and cost saving. The materials used in the process are eco-friendly. 3D models transmitted electronically, so they can be printed whenever needed. Compared to the traditional on-site construction Winsun’s (leading 3D construction printer) process save about 80% on construction costs, 60% on labour costs and 60% on waste.</li>
</ol>
<strong>How did 3D printing - initially take off?</strong>
3D printing is not as new as you think; it has existed since 1980s. Charles Hull, who invented ‘Stereolithography’ in 1986, created the first 3D printer. He also founded one of the world’s leading 3D printing company ‘3D Systems’.

Since mid-1980s , many new 3D printing technologies have been developed  and a variety of new firms  entered the marketplace. The basic technology is not new. Until then the cost of 3D printers were expensive ($ 10,000) and huge in size, thus was used by large companies

Over the next decade, the patents for several types of 3D printing technologies expired and increased the levels of innovation.  In 2002, scientists from Wake Forest Institute of Regenerative Medicine developed the first 3D printed working kidney, which gained wide media visibility of this technology.

RepRap project, an open source initiative launched with a vision to build a self-replicating 3D printer in 2005. This project opened doors to many advances in the technology. The next few years saw innovations in the industry like DIY kits, bio-printing, customization in vast manufacturing and 3D printing movement started to gain visibility. As a result, the prices of 3D printer dropped from $ 10000 to $ 2000 or less and size shrunk from refrigerator to microwave.

In 2013, President Barack Obama mentioned 3D printing as a major issue for the future in his State of the Union speech, which finished to make “3D printing” an absolute buzzword. The technology revolutionized the industrial sector with its capabilities and wide range applications. More and more small and large companies are invading the technology due to its low prototyping cost.

3D printing has not achieved the heights, and shows immense potential in reshaping the consumer industry.

<strong>3D printing in the GCC</strong>
3D printing technology is gaining momentum in construction industry as the cost and time are reduced in comparison to the traditional methods.

In 2016, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of UAE and Ruler of Dubai, has launched the ‘Dubai 3D Printing Strategy’, a unique global initiative that aims to exploit technology for the service of humanity and promote the status of the UAE and Dubai as a leading hub of 3D printing technology by the year 2030. The strategy aims of 3D printing 25% of Dubai’s buildings by 2030 (Dubai Future Foundation).

According to recent blog by Marmore on Dubai’s 3D printing house crisis, this technology will ease the major challenges faced by the construction industry (labour and cost). Due to the advantages of this technology on time, cost and labour, 3D technology has paved way as a solution to number of problems in housing sector in GCC.
‘Office of the Future’ is the first 3D printed office in the world was unveiled in Dubai within few months of the launch of 3D strategy. It took only 17 days to complete this structure.

3DPME (<a href="http://www.threedp.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Threedp</a>), founded by Abdullah Alhussainan in Kuwait in late 2014, provides 3D printing services to companies, sells 3D printers and provides training on the technology. Recently Alhussainan launched an app called INDX, which is a directory to find the makers and designers in 3D printing in Kuwait. The app sponsored by Ministry of Youth Affairs. 3D printing is a one of the promising technology with its huge benefits in comparison to the traditional manufacturing. The adoption of the technology will inject growth in almost all sectors of industries. It has huge potential in creation of job force by introducing new professions like product designers, printer operators or related to production of 3D printers in the market.

Imagine that you are riding an Uber or Didi Ride back home. In the middle of the ride, you realised that there’s nothing cooked for dinner at home and time is short as you are already late. And you suddenly placed an online order for some fancy food with a newly discovered app and paid it by Paypal or VISA. When you reach your destination, you pay Uber by Paypal and a few minutes later, Mint app pops up a message notifying that you have overspent for this month and getting chauffeured too much!

The interconnectivity of applications and network infrastructure is made possible by APIs, which allows apps and systems to talk to each other, a kind of advanced technological loop. API is the simplest form of standardized protocol for computer programs to talk to each other and is integral to modern software development (Banking Tech Website). An API, specifics the connection mechanism, the data, and functionality that are made available and what rules other pieces of software need to follow to interact with this data and functionality.

An organization can use API to allow third parties to access their data or services in a controlled environment. Using an API is like using a particular desired part of the software and not the entire one which remains protected. An example would be a Facebook “like” on third party website. Additionally Google, Facebook and Apple have created their own digital ecosystems through the use of public APIs and by allowing third parties to add functionality to their core services, these companies become for third party innovation.

<strong>The API Universe</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Private </strong><strong>APIs: </strong>Private APIs are closed APIs, and therefore exclusively accessible by parties within the boundaries of the organisation.</li>
 	<li><strong>Partner APIs: </strong>APIs that are open to selected partners based on bilateral agreements. Like Private APIs, Partner APIs are exclusively accessible at the discretion of the provider of the APIs. Bilateral agreements on specific data exchanges between for instance a bank and an enterprise resource (ERP) software provider is an example of a Partner API.</li>
 	<li><strong>Member APIs: </strong>This type of API is open to everyone who is a formal member of a community with a well-defined set of membership rules. When becoming member of such a community the API provider allows access to the community members who comply with community membership rules and regulations.</li>
 	<li><strong>Acquaintance APIs: </strong>This type of Open APIs is inclusive, as they are open to every- one complying with a predefined set of requirements. Merchant access to point-of-sale (POS) APIs is an example in this category.</li>
 	<li><strong>Public APIs: </strong>Public APIs are inclusive and can thus be accessed by anyone, typically with some form of registration for identification and authentication purposes. As software continues its march to transform all industries, lack of connectivity increasingly equates to being broken. If software developers are the new rock stars, then APIs are the instruments (Banking Tech Website).</li>

This has seen Apple Pay integrated in a number of payment systems, especially in the case of in-app purchases. More and more banks have been able to integrate Apple Pay thanks to the APIs.<strong>"</strong>

However, open data sharing by institutions, data collection and analysis is not risk proof altogether. Issues like consumer consent, data-protection, data-safety, limits to sharing with third parties, validation and ever rising threat of massive data-breaches, data-hacks and data-compromise will shore up. Financial institutions may rightly be worried about allowing third-party vendors, some without any prior business relationship, to access data that leads back to their systems of record. And to make this work, banks need to begin where they feel comfortable, such as by creating APIs that support their internal development (Open Legacy and Open Innovation website ). This is the area where regulations and regulatory bodies sweep in attempting to redress consumer and their data concerns.

<strong>Adoption in the GCC ICT Ecosystem</strong>
<div>

In pursuit of having stronger digital partnerships, Kuwait Based Zain telecom, launched its APIs (with Google Cloud acting as API platform provider) in a bid to connect its operating companies across the region onto a single enablement platform (CommsMEA website). The primary objective of launching APIs across the region is to achieve greater agility and consider new market opportunities.

According to Strategy&amp; and Siemens 2017 survey, only 3% of surveyed companies (306 companies from Qatar and UAE) are at the advanced stage of digital transformation, and only 18% of these companies use cloud computing(Strategy&amp; Siemens Survey website). The pace of digitization is sluggish in many parts of the region, both in public and private sectors. There is a huge potential for digitization in sectors such as transportation sector (including airports, airlines, and public transportation companies) (Strategy &amp; PwC Report 2017).
Slow pace of digitization implies less spending on IT infrastructure and thereby low advancement of process of digitization.  But at the macro level, Information and communication technology spending across the MENA region recorded growth of 2.7% on year-on-year basis, reaching more than USD 230bn (International Data Corporation 2018). As the pace of digitization picks up in the future, more and more APIs will be launched. APIs generally help bring customers to a single entry point across platforms and regions. However, with the growth in APIs to unify multiple digital platforms and services, the question of how to effectively protect data integrity and privacy will keep growing.

Some international developments offer a leading indicator of what to potentially expect as trends for the future. For e.g., new compliance requirements, such as the Payment Services Directive version 2 (PSD2) and the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are handing more power back to the consumer, giving them more control over how and who they transact with and what happens to their personal data.

</div>
<strong>GDPR</strong>, for example, will give European consumers more control over their personal data and the information organizations can collect on them, while also setting out regulations to enforce better protection of such information. GDPR specifically stipulates that when it comes to organizations gathering or sharing information on consumers, “opt out” measures are no longer sufficient. Instead, consumers will have to “opt in” to share their information or receive communications, and they will be able to expressly say whether or not their data can be shared with third parties.
<div>

<strong>Payment Services Directive 2</strong> will fundamentally change how consumers access their financial data as well as how, and with whom, they transact. At the moment, consumers holding accounts at multiple institutions need to log into each account via that institution’s digital interface, whether this is via a mobile app or an online portal. But to promote competition in financial services and improve ease of use for consumers, PSD2 makes provision for data aggregators, which allow for a single view of accounts at multiple providers (insurance companies, payments services, credit card issuers, mortgage lenders, etc.). All account information, all financial products, and all transactions will be visible on a single dashboard. To make this possible, PSD2 will require banks and other financial service providers to open their data and payment initiation capabilities to third parties.

In conclusion, it can be said with confidence that financial services entities in the GCC will increasingly join forces with FinTech companies through open APIs. How regulators cope with this development will be an interesting space to watch.

According to a recent study from the World Economic Forum, the Infrastructure and Urban development industry worldwide, have a stagnant productivity due to its failure to innovate as quickly as the other sectors. This has caused a negative effect on the economy, society and the environment. Despite robust economic growth and the affluent nature, the GCC region has been experiencing a housing shortage.

GCC housing crisis is spurred by macroeconomic drivers like urban population growth and the age structure. The working age population growth (worker’s spread increase the demand for new households and the willingness to consume better housing rises) in the GCC is significantly higher than the World and the MENA average.

Also, the steady increase in the urban population in the region (85% of the population lives in the city, expected to rise to 90% by 2050(PwC)) has hit harder on the lower and middle income households. Thus the pressure of housing affordability has been increasingly felt by the government and the population across the region.

In 2017, the shortage of affordable housing was 75,000 in Bahrain, 700,000 in Saudi Arabia. A recent Marmore study, <em>GCC Affordable Housing</em>, found that the demand for affordable housing is estimated to grow over the years in the region, with Saudi Arabia leading the set.

<strong>Demand for Affordable Housing - 2022 (forecast in million)</strong> <img src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GCC-housing-crisis-and-3D-printing-Fig1.jpg" width="681" height="304" />

Deloitte reports that significant affordable housing is required across Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Bahrain. The GCC nations have planned new housing schemes to solve these shortages, Kuwait plans to build $14bn residential city with 35,000 units and Saudi Arabia to build 100,000 units over the next seven years in Riyadh(Deloitte).

The complexity inherent in the design and construction of buildings as GCC nations urbanise causes a serious challenge to have an affordable place to live. In addition shortage of qualified workers is one of the key reason for the industry’s stagnant productivity( World Economic Forum). Besides bringing changes in the housing policies, housing finance to solve the housing market shortage, technological advances like 3D printing can be well applied to meet these challenges.

3D printing is a technological breakthrough in the construction industry that changes the traditional way of construction process itself. 3D printing refers to the production of physical objects layer by layer by an automated computer-controlled machine. This can potentially increase the productivity across the sector as it involves more standardised elements with limited finishing work constructed on-site. 3D Printing can effectively reduce the cost (finance, materials and labour)(PwC) and increase the demand in the sector. Realizing the potential, UAE has launched the ‘Dubai 3D printing strategy’ that aims to promote Dubai as the leading hub of 3D printing technology by 2030.

<img src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GCC-housing-crisis-and-3D-printing-Fig2.jpg" width="681" />
This initiative marks to bring positive economic returns and contribute to sustainable economic development. As a part of the initiative, Dubai operated the first 3D printed office in the world in 2016 (Constructed by Winsun). It also focuses on the construction of buildings for humanitarian causes, mobile homes, villas and so on.

Saudi Arabia has proposed to build 1.5 million housing units over five years using the 3D printing technology, to increase the number of available houses. Hence the GCC market for 3D printing is already lead by UAE and Saudi Arabia which is more likely to solve the cost-value gap.
For the emerging GCC economies, 3D printing technology could benefit the construction sector by number of ways
<ul>
 	<li>Mitigate the shortage of skilled construction workers</li>
 	<li>Improves the quality and accuracy of the end product</li>
 	<li>Affordable tailored designs</li>
 	<li>Sustainability</li>
 	<li>Increasing the speed of construction</li>
 	<li>Prefabrication based modular construction creates safer environment</li>
</ul>
These benefits of the 3D technology itself could solve the major challenges in the construction industry (Labour and Cost) paving ideal way to combat the housing crisis in the GCC region.

3D printing devices and materials are constantly evolving offering many benefits to the user. There are a number of start-ups offering 3D printing services by creating new, innovative projects (BCG and World Economic Forum).

MX3D- Amsterdam based start-up applies robotic 3D printing to the construction process, created the world’s first 3D printed steel bridge. The impact of the MX3D technology has significantly reduced the time and cost of building complex structures.

Winsun- Shanghai based company produces 3D printed houses at scale. Using 3D printed technology, construction units are pre-fabricated off site. This has increased the productivity and has caused significant cost savings. With Winsun approach, a standard house is built for about $30,000 and a new building can rise one storey per day.

Apis Cor- San Francisco based start-up prints entire house on-site rather than creating individual elements off-site and transporting them. The firm strongly believes that 3D printing is a solution to the housing crisis.

Realising such smart technology enabled development require considerable integration of government and the private sector. Adoption of 3D printing in the construction industry requires changes across legislations, funding, research and other public policy measures. Dubai has scaled up and created such incentives in five pillars to meet its 3D printing strategy namely infrastructure, legislative structure, funding, talent and market demand. Thus Dubai’s vision of technological application and creating a conducive market for 3D printing can increase productivity in the sector and aid to solve the housing crisis. This strategy could help the region and the world as it could be a prototype to better understand and take advantage of the 3D printing technology.

Bahrain, with the launch of dedicated FinTech Hub in Feb 2018 (<em>Zawya</em>), become the second country in the MENA region to have exclusive FinTech infrastructure followed by UAE. UAE is considered to be the leading hub for FinTech in the region (<em>The National 2017</em>), continuing boosting innovation and collaboration. UAE developed region’s first regulatory sandbox allowing new products to be tested for two years without full regulatory compliance.  FinTech in both the countries is in different stages where service domains and regulatory frameworks differ. A brief regulatory and trend comparison is summarised below,

In terms of regulation of service domains, standardization of services and data security laws, both the countries share similar features. Bahrain serves the objectives of consumer benefits and financial inclusion whereas as Abu Dhabi’s regulatory sandbox essentially focuses on innovation and competition, perhaps, in both the countries consumer protection framework is weak. However, regulatory sandboxes in UAE and Bahrain don’t have minimum capital limit. Bahrain and UAE still doesn’t have reporting requirements as Australia, Brunei and Hong Kong have currently laid out (<em>Consultative Group to assist Poor, Report 2017</em>).

Bahrain in terms of Reglab, falls behind UAE.  Currently three Reglabs are operating in the UAE; first being launched in May 2016 and it was MENA regions first too, whereas Bahrain entered into cooperation agreement in January 2018 to launch Reglab in the country (<em>Bahrain FinTech Bay Website, 2018</em>). Hive at the Dubai International Financial Centre is among them. Overall, the Abu Dhabi Global Market FinTech hub is ranked as the top FinTech for the MENA region, by Deloitte in partnership with Global FinTech Hubs Federation 2017 (<em>Abu Dhabi Global Market Website, 2017</em>).

Regionally only few FinTech start-ups have managed to tap the opportunity existing between conventional financial services and growing needs of the consumers. One of such technology avenues is SME lending, an domain in FinTech universe that is expected to gain substantial pace in years ahead apart from payments, crowd funds, Islamic finance, Digital currency. However in Bahrain, currently, payments services and digital currency along with Micro Finance and InsureTech and RegTech are topping the services slots and innovation.

<strong>The Way Forward</strong>
UAE is ahead in comparisons with Bahrain in adaptation and building framework for the digital currency whereas Bahrain is in nascent stage to officially layout operating and regulatory framework. Dubai based blockchain start-up ArabianChain, launched a new digital assets exchange called Palmex in 2018, which enables users to deposit and trade currency including ArabianChain’s Dubai Coin. On top of it, UAE leads in blockchain technology, which established Global Blockchain council back in 2016. Furthermore, UAE and Saudi Arabia are expected to launch cross border digital currency soon. In the payments sector, Bahrain is active where recently Bahrain Islamic Bank is in talk with BENEFIT for development of client/consumer payments system and expecting to launch it shortly. BENEFIT, established in 1997, is licensed by the Central Bank of Bahrain as an ancillary service provider to the Kingdom’s financial services industry. BENEFIT is owned by Banks in Bahrain and by the Bahrain’s Central Bank.

Moreover, Bahrain’s start-ups ecosystem is diverse and spans the Kingdom’s key sectors, including tourism and F&B. Bahrain has traditional legacy strengths in the financial services sector as it was one of the key financial hubs of the region in the recent past. Also, Bahrain is likely to profit from the trend of consolidation of FinTech competences in the region, giving it a competitive advantage along with the UAE in terms of being early pioneers.

		<Title>[:en]Electric and Hybrid Vehicles - How soon can they disrupt in GCC?[:ar]السيارات الكهربائيه والهجينة – هل اقترب موعد إزعاجهاقث لدول مجلس التعاون الخليجي؟[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">
<div style="text-align: left;">

Global demand for electric vehicles is expected to surge during the next few decades. The market was valued at almost USD 103bn in 2015 and expected to be close to USD 400bn by 2024. Sales are growing exponentially and have outpaced expectations, boosted by faster than anticipated battery improvements. World hybrid and electric vehicle (H/EV) sales is anticipated to more than double through 2018, reaching 25.6 million units and accounting for nearly 25% of all new motor vehicles sold. Considering the phenomenal transformation, global car industry is undergoing, it would be typical to expect similar trend in the GCC markets. Especially, since the Middle East’s automotive market is ripe for the development and introduction of new ‘clean vehicle’ technologies, as the tech savvy, city dwelling societies hold a lot of potential for the adoption of future mobility solutions.

However, contrary to this the uptake on electric vehicles (EV) when compared with other markets, has been sluggish in the GCC region. We believe, despite a lot of buzz around the electric cars, their large scale disruptive adoption in the region is not achievable in the immediate future. We highlight some of the prominent reasons for this:

<strong>Fuel Price Parity</strong>
Hybrid/ Electric (H/EV) cars are attractive alternative in countries with high fuel prices, however, they lack luster in GCC countries as the fuel prices are low. The electric cars are more economical than petrol cars, for instance, in oil importing countries.

<strong>Starting Price of Selected Cars in UAE</strong>

<strong>Tesla Vs Petrol car: Costs Convergence Estimation</strong>

With Dubai prices for electricity and petrol, it would cost a USD 1.4 to drive a Tesla Model 3 for 100km. In comparison, the same distance in a petrol car would cost USD 4.3. However, some of the top selling cars in UAE costs about one-third as much as the Tesla. Considering the price of the electric cars, and the low fuel prices in the GCC region, the gain from the fuel costs, isn’t attractive enough for the buyers to opt for electric cars instead of petrol cars. For instance, based on the savings per 100km and the average price of the cars discussed in the chart above, it would take a UAE driver 2.2 million kms to recover the additional cost incurred. The disparity in pricing is larger, if more economical petrol cars are compared to the Tesla.

A major reason not to choose an electric vehicle is due to absence of charging infrastructure. The current range for 2018 Nissan Leaf is around 241-257 kilometers (150-160 miles) with full charge of 40 kWh battery, while the Tesla Model 3 is c.354-498 kilometers (220-310 miles) with full charge 75 kWh . Though this range has relatively improved compared to the earlier models, absence of enough charging points to charge their cars and the problem of getting stranded in the middle of nowhere is a major concern. There is almost a complete absence of a public charging network in the GCC region.  Amongst the GCC countries, UAE has the most developed charging infrastructure which includes-100 charging stations installed by the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (Dewa) all over the emirate, each capable of powering 24 cars simultaneously. Additionally, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company plans to raise its 12 charging stations to 20 in the capital. However, this infrastructure is not comforting enough considering the number of petrol stations.

<strong>Long recharging – Practical difficulties</strong>
There are three different types of chargers: AC Level 1 (slow, such as a wall socket), AC Level 2 (medium, between two and four hours) and DC fast charging (fast, less than 30 minutes). Depending on the type of charger, the time to charge an electric car could be 30 minutes or up to 12 hours. The size of battery and the charging speed are the key factors that determine the time it takes to charge. The long duration to refuel the car which in conventional case would take a few minutes is a major disincentive for the drivers thinking about shifting to H/EV cars.

<strong>Governments Incentives</strong>
Government subsidies and policy support is indispensable for lowering barriers to adoption. A supportive policy environment enables market growth by making vehicles appealing for consumers.  As of now, UAE is the only country in the GCC which has taken measures to push for adoption of H/EV. For instance, UAE recently devised an incentive program to encourage motorists to buy new zero-carbon-emissions electric vehicles through green bank loans, green insurance plans and green registration of vehicles. The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) in Dubai added 50 Tesla cars to Dubai Taxi fleet. Additionally, it has endorsed a contract for procuring 554 environment-friendly hybrid vehicles fitted with a combination of fuel engines and electric motors.

As UAE chases its green plan to be one of the leading sustainable cities by 2020 as part of Dubai’s “Vision 2021” plan which focuses on improving the quality of air, preserving water resources, increasing the contribution of clean energy and implementing green growth plans. Dubai has set target for 2020 for 2% of all vehicles to be hybrid or electric, and 10% by 2030. It is more likely that the UAE Government would devise policies incentivizing and facilitating the achievement of its goals. This Governments’ support and push for adoption of electric vehicles is non-existent or very marginal in the other GCC countries.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>
A large share of EV products today meet only the needs of niche consumer segments and miss the true opportunity to serve consumers who want more basic mobility solutions. The premium pricing of the electric vehicles and low petrol prices in the region make it difficult for electric cars to compete. Public awareness and enthusiasm for EVs needs to grow, and this in turn will encourage governments to maintain public subsidies as EV technology matures. This contradicts the efforts by various GCC governments who are currently in the process removing fuel subsidies. Financial incentives and the availability of charging infrastructure were factors that were positively correlated with the growth of electric vehicle market share in other geographies. However, these factors are largely absent in the GCC region. Moreover, the authorities need to ensure robust regulations are in place to support consumers looking to make a smart move to electric vehicles. The picture could certainly become much clearer over the decade as technological advancements bring higher efficiencies and there develops a genuine need for EVs as an economical and environmental solution. For now, disruption is still a long drive ahead!

Global demand for electric vehicles is expected to surge during the next few decades. The market was valued at almost USD 103bn in 2015 and expected to be close to USD 400bn by 2024. Sales are growing exponentially and have outpaced expectations, boosted by faster than anticipated battery improvements. World hybrid and electric vehicle (H/EV) sales is anticipated to more than double through 2018, reaching 25.6 million units and accounting for nearly 25% of all new motor vehicles sold. Considering the phenomenal transformation, global car industry is undergoing, it would be typical to expect similar trend in the GCC markets. Especially, since the Middle East’s automotive market is ripe for the development and introduction of new ‘clean vehicle’ technologies, as the tech savvy, city dwelling societies hold a lot of potential for the adoption of future mobility solutions.

However, contrary to this the uptake on electric vehicles (EV) when compared with other markets, has been sluggish in the GCC region. We believe, despite a lot of buzz around the electric cars, their large scale disruptive adoption in the region is not achievable in the immediate future. We highlight some of the prominent reasons for this:

<strong>Fuel Price Parity</strong>
Hybrid/ Electric (H/EV) cars are attractive alternative in countries with high fuel prices, however, they lack luster in GCC countries as the fuel prices are low. The electric cars are more economical than petrol cars, for instance, in oil importing countries.

<strong>Tesla Vs Petrol car: Costs Convergence Estimation</strong>

With Dubai prices for electricity and petrol, it would cost a USD 1.4 to drive a Tesla Model 3 for 100km. In comparison, the same distance in a petrol car would cost USD 4.3. However, some of the top selling cars in UAE costs about one-third as much as the Tesla. Considering the price of the electric cars, and the low fuel prices in the GCC region, the gain from the fuel costs, isn’t attractive enough for the buyers to opt for electric cars instead of petrol cars. For instance, based on the savings per 100km and the average price of the cars discussed in the chart above, it would take a UAE driver 2.2 million kms to recover the additional cost incurred. The disparity in pricing is larger, if more economical petrol cars are compared to the Tesla.

		<Title>[:en]Autonomous Vehicles – How will they transform the GCC Real Estate Sector?[:ar]المركبات الذاتية – كيف ستقوم بتحويل قطاع العقارات في دول مجلس التعاون الخليجي؟[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">
<div style="text-align: left;">

The transport industry is on the cusp of another major breakthrough as Autonomous vehicles are expected not only to revolutionize the way we travel, but also the way we live. Billions of dollars have already been invested in pioneering the technology as well as equipping infrastructure to support it. Going by the trends, self-driven cars may soon be a common sight on roads in the near future. This disruptive change, which is expected to be a milestone for the auto industry, will also have implications on several other sectors. Real estate and infrastructure development is expected to be one of them.

Beyond the obvious benefits of improving road safety, reducing inefficiencies in usage of vehicles and also mitigate traffic congestion, their inception would also change the dynamics of the real estate market. The perception of real estate asset value and urban development patterns would change as we start to embrace this technology.

<strong>Autonomous vehicles – Are they the future?</strong>
History insists that when a technology has both utility and presents an economically compelling case, it is highly likely to be adopted. In an age which is seemingly dictated by technology, adoption of self-driving vehicles looks inevitable. Despite the heavy investments required, the economics is expected to be in favor of self-driven vehicles in the long run. Changes are expected to be gradual by starting with vehicles having low levels of automation in controlled environments and then reducing human intervention and opening them up to larger environment as time goes by.

By 2035, more than 12 million fully autonomous vehicles and 18 million partially autonomous vehicles are expected to be sold per year globally. Their market share by the end of 2035 is expected to be 25% of the new car market.

However, the main challenge pitted against them is the development of infrastructure and necessary software to enable large scale implementation. Testing is already underway with companies like Google working on algorithms to make fully autonomous vehicles a reality.

<strong>Impact on the Real Estate Sector</strong>
The Real Estate and Infrastructure development space could undergo a transformation due to the emergence of self-driving vehicles. The pricing mechanism of real estate assets and the way in which communities are developed would see a major change.

The key factor in determining the price of real estate asset in today’s market is its location and the availability of amenities. As the adoption of self-driving vehicles increase, we can expect the prices of real estate assets to have lesser correlation with the proximity of an asset to the center of a city.

Slowly, the need for people to have homes closer to their workplace or prime locations would reduce as traffic management would become more efficient thereby reducing travel time. On-time arrival and pickup would be possible on a more consistent basis through Artificial Intelligence. As travel time reduces, the proximity to a prime location will not have the impact it once had.

Autonomous vehicles would also pave way for more efficient usage of parking space. The demand for parking space would reduce as cars would have the capability of dropping people at their destination and parking themselves. This would save up a lot of real estate assigned for parking purposes as multiple single-level parking lots would be replaced by a single multi-level parking lot. The concept of automated multi-level parking could save further space by incorporating refueling stations/charging stations and maintenance facilities. This reduces the need for dedicated fuel stations.

As cars would not need any manual intervention, it would additionally open up the option of using the car for other commutes instead of lying idle in the parking lot. This would reduce the need for people to have their own cars as car-pooling during idle time would be seen as a more economically viable and hassle free alternative. All these factors put together will reshape the way in which communities are being developed and bring price uniformity. The importance of having the asset in prime locations will slowly diminish while factors such as size and quality of amenities available will take precedence.

In GCC context, this bears a higher significance considering the availability of land. Barring Saudi Arabia and Oman, land remains a scarce resource for all GCC countries. The real estate freed up by replacing parking spaces and fuel stations could be used for much more productive purposes. Pricing of land throughout the country would have a degree of uniformity; trigger the development of underdeveloped areas which would otherwise not be desirable due to its distance from prime locations of the city.

<strong>Are GCC countries prepared for autonomous vehicles?</strong>
The UAE has been at the forefront among GCC countries in terms of readiness to adopt autonomous vehicles. The UAE ranks 8<sup>th</sup> globally ahead of developed countries Japan and France according to KPMG’ Autonomous Vehicles Readiness Index (AVRI). The Index evaluates the country’s ability to adopt self-driving vehicles based on several factors such as availability of electric vehicle charging stations, autonomous transport technology R&D, the public’s willingness to adopt the technology, and the regulatory environment.

According to Dubai Autonomous Transport Strategy, the city sets a target of one quarter of the total cars on road to be driverless by 2030. The initiative is expected to bring annual revenue of AED 22 Bn through reduction of transportation costs, emissions and accidents.

Although other GCC countries might not be in the same stage as the UAE in terms of readiness, they have acknowledged the role of autonomous vehicles being an integral part of the future and started taking steps towards their adoption. Saudi Arabia has been looking at incorporating Autonomous vehicles as part of its USD 100 Bn King Abdullah Economic City (KAEC) project.

<strong>Outlook – Embracing change</strong>
As the arrival of self-driven vehicle seems imminent, real estate players need to be aware of the implications that they could bring. Any disruptive change is expected to alter the status quo and present an array of challenges to the incumbent. However, challenges could always be perceived as opportunities. Similarly, Real Estate developers need to adapt and modify their development projects in ways that would be accommodative of self-driven vehicles. The inception of higher levels of autonomy in vehicles would bring the requirement of building sophisticated infrastructure to support them. This would also be a key benefit for the players in the infrastructure space. Commercial real estate development would now not be saturated in prime locations alone. As travel distance and time taken for commute loses significance, it creates demand for real estate in non-prime locations presenting more opportunities for real estate development.

This scenario would be highly applicable for GCC countries as most of them have limited land availability. Technologies such as electric and autonomous vehicles would help their problem of tackling pollution and also free up land resources to be utilized for more productive purposes. With the UAE leading the way, other GCC countries have also realized the importance of autonomous vehicles and started taking steps to accommodate them in future. With these impending changes to be implemented in due course of time, real estate sector will witness a significant change and the industry as a whole is also expected to adapt likewise.

The transport industry is on the cusp of another major breakthrough as Autonomous vehicles are expected not only to revolutionize the way we travel, but also the way we live. Billions of dollars have already been invested in pioneering the technology as well as equipping infrastructure to support it. Going by the trends, self-driven cars may soon be a common sight on roads in the near future. This disruptive change, which is expected to be a milestone for the auto industry, will also have implications on several other sectors. Real estate and infrastructure development is expected to be one of them.

Beyond the obvious benefits of improving road safety, reducing inefficiencies in usage of vehicles and also mitigate traffic congestion, their inception would also change the dynamics of the real estate market. The perception of real estate asset value and urban development patterns would change as we start to embrace this technology.

<strong>Autonomous vehicles – Are they the future?</strong>
History insists that when a technology has both utility and presents an economically compelling case, it is highly likely to be adopted. In an age which is seemingly dictated by technology, adoption of self-driving vehicles looks inevitable. Despite the heavy investments required, the economics is expected to be in favor of self-driven vehicles in the long run. Changes are expected to be gradual by starting with vehicles having low levels of automation in controlled environments and then reducing human intervention and opening them up to larger environment as time goes by.

By 2035, more than 12 million fully autonomous vehicles and 18 million partially autonomous vehicles are expected to be sold per year globally. Their market share by the end of 2035 is expected to be 25% of the new car market.

However, the main challenge pitted against them is the development of infrastructure and necessary software to enable large scale implementation. Testing is already underway with companies like Google working on algorithms to make fully autonomous vehicles a reality.

<strong>Impact on the Real Estate Sector</strong>
The Real Estate and Infrastructure development space could undergo a transformation due to the emergence of self-driving vehicles. The pricing mechanism of real estate assets and the way in which communities are developed would see a major change.

The key factor in determining the price of real estate asset in today’s market is its location and the availability of amenities. As the adoption of self-driving vehicles increase, we can expect the prices of real estate assets to have lesser correlation with the proximity of an asset to the center of a city.

Slowly, the need for people to have homes closer to their workplace or prime locations would reduce as traffic management would become more efficient thereby reducing travel time. On-time arrival and pickup would be possible on a more consistent basis through Artificial Intelligence. As travel time reduces, the proximity to a prime location will not have the impact it once had.

Autonomous vehicles would also pave way for more efficient usage of parking space. The demand for parking space would reduce as cars would have the capability of dropping people at their destination and parking themselves. This would save up a lot of real estate assigned for parking purposes as multiple single-level parking lots would be replaced by a single multi-level parking lot. The concept of automated multi-level parking could save further space by incorporating refueling stations/charging stations and maintenance facilities. This reduces the need for dedicated fuel stations.

As cars would not need any manual intervention, it would additionally open up the option of using the car for other commutes instead of lying idle in the parking lot. This would reduce the need for people to have their own cars as car-pooling during idle time would be seen as a more economically viable and hassle free alternative. All these factors put together will reshape the way in which communities are being developed and bring price uniformity. The importance of having the asset in prime locations will slowly diminish while factors such as size and quality of amenities available will take precedence.

In GCC context, this bears a higher significance considering the availability of land. Barring Saudi Arabia and Oman, land remains a scarce resource for all GCC countries. The real estate freed up by replacing parking spaces and fuel stations could be used for much more productive purposes. Pricing of land throughout the country would have a degree of uniformity; trigger the development of underdeveloped areas which would otherwise not be desirable due to its distance from prime locations of the city.

<strong>Are GCC countries prepared for autonomous vehicles?</strong>
The UAE has been at the forefront among GCC countries in terms of readiness to adopt autonomous vehicles. The UAE ranks 8<sup>th</sup> globally ahead of developed countries Japan and France according to KPMG’ Autonomous Vehicles Readiness Index (AVRI). The Index evaluates the country’s ability to adopt self-driving vehicles based on several factors such as availability of electric vehicle charging stations, autonomous transport technology R&D, the public’s willingness to adopt the technology, and the regulatory environment.

		<Title><![CDATA[[:en]World's Cheapest Power Project: A milestone shift to solar electricity generation?[:]]]></Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">
<div style="text-align: left;">

Saudi Arabia recently registered the cheapest price bid to supply solar electricity ever recorded. Abu Dhabi’s Masdar and Electricite de France SA bid to supply power from a 300-megawatt photovoltaic (PV) plant for as cheap as 1.79 cents a kilowatt hour. If the project is successfully awarded by the Ministry of Renewable Energy Project Development, it would top the leader board beating the previous record for a solar project in Abu Dhabi for 2.42 cents a kilowatt-hour. It is a milestone in Saudi Arabia’s nascent solar program and a landmark start of a USD 50 billion program to diversify domestic energy supplies away from fossil fuels.

<strong>Bids for Saudi Arabia’s Sakaka Solar plant</strong>

Saudi Arabia is among the leading Middle Eastern oil producers looking to renewables to feed growing domestic consumption that’s soaking up crude which it could profitably export to generate higher revenues. The plant in Sakaka will be the first project awarded under the renewables program, which targets 9,500 megawatts of electricity generation capacity using solar and wind by 2030( Bloomberg). The project is set to start producing power by June 2019.

<strong>Record lowest solar power pricing (US cents/kWh)</strong>

Prices for new solar power projects have fallen so rapidly that the cheapest price of previous year has become the ceiling price for the current year. The prices have reduced by as much as 78% since 2013. A combination of improving and less costly technology, free land earmarked for the plants, connections to the national power grid and favourable financing have helped to significantly reduce the costs. Developers are also expected to benefit from the economies of scale due to the large sized projects. The already-plummeting costs of installing solar power could fall by further 60 percent over the next decade(IRENA).

<strong>Current power generation scenario</strong>
Saudi Arabia generated 330.5 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity from installed capacity of 66 GW in 2016(EIA). It faces a sharply rising demand driven by population growth, a rapidly expanding industrial sector led by the development of petrochemical cities and high demand for air conditioning during the summer months. Total generating capacity is expected to be over 120 GW by 2032.

<strong>Saudi Arabia’ installed electric power capacity by fuel as of Jan 2017</strong>
<img src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Worlds-Cheapest-Power-Project-Fig3.jpg" width="681" height="304" />

Saudi Arabia that gets less than 1 percent of its power from renewables currently, is targeting 60 projects in renewable energy program with investments estimated between USD 30 billion and USD 50 billion by 2030(Reuters). The expansion into renewables will substitute the usage of 18 million barrels of oil equivalent for electricity generation by 2020.

<strong>Outlook for solar energy in Saudi Arabia</strong>

Saudi Arabia’s renewable energy program is part of a broader project to wean the economy from its reliance on oil exports. The kingdom is restructuring its energy sector as part of Vision 2030 and a focus on renewable projects is a pillar of this transformation. Saudi Arabia is an ideal location for both Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) and PV power generation as it has remarkably high solar radiation of around 2,550 kWh/m2 per year, which is almost double the average radiation in European countries. There is also the availability of vast areas of empty desert that can host solar installations. Additionally, Saudi Arabia has huge deposits of the type of clear sand that can potentially be used in the manufacture of silicon PV cells.

However, some barriers may exist such as large reserves of oil with relatively low cost compared to solar energy. Saudi Arabia also currently lack any demand-side policies to stimulate the private sector. These include tax benefits or feed-in tariffs for renewable electricity generation. In addition, the dust effect, which can reduce solar energy by up to 10–20 % can be a major hindrance and will require solar energy technology to be adapted for desert conditions to enable more efficient harnessing of the energy.

Still, the percentage of renewable energy is estimated to reach 10 percent of total installed capacity in Saudi Arabia by 2023. Further, The King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy (KACARE) is targeting for 41 GW of solar power, 17.6 GW of nuclear power, and 9 GW of wind power by 2032(KACARE). The fact that Saudi Arabia, an ardent booster of fossil fuels, has found compelling economic reasons to bet on solar is one of the clearest signs yet that solar has become a cost-effective source of power.

<strong>Why Jazeera entered the Indian aviation industry?</strong>
Low oil prices for the past couple of years have generally led to surging profits in aviation industry globally as spending on fuel, the major component of cost structure, dropped sharply. However, it is a game of double-edged sword in the context of Gulf airlines. Lower fuel costs have resulted in some airlines dropping their ticket prices in an attempt to attract more passengers and capture greater market share in the region where aviation industry is experiencing overcapacity. It has led to a race to the bottom in the industry, with plummeting yields. The average yield per seat for Jazeera airways fell to as low as USD 119 in Q1 2017. Jazeera also has significantly lower load factor (measures the capacity utilization) of approximately 75.5% YTD as compared to average of 81% in the Middle East. Thus the slowing economy and the continued overcapacity on the airlines’ routes essentially forced the airways to explore opportunities outside the region.

Similar to other Gulf States, Kuwait has a large population of workers from the Indian sub-continent who fulfill a wide range of blue collar and managerial roles. Jazeera is targeting the constant flow of travelers going back and forth for work as well as those traveling as tourists. There are number of airlines that currently operate between Kuwait and India such as Oman Air, Emirates, Etihad Airways, Gulf Air, Fly Dubai etc. In contrary to many airlines providing services on this route, the airlines that provide non-stop flights, that take significantly lesser time, are currently limited to three namely Kuwait Airways, Jet Airways and Air India. It therefore make the route much more attractive to small-haul airlines such as Jazeera Airways which will operate direct flights. As of 16<sup>th</sup> Oct, 2017 the lowest airfare from Kuwait to India offered by these airlines in the month of December was Kuwait Airways (USD 149), Jet Airways (169) and Air India (USD 211) for a one way trip. In comparison Jazeera Airways is offering fare per passenger as low as USD 94. Jazeera Airways will begin with weekly 7 flights to Hyderabad in November and increasing it to 23 flights to India by the year end.

Note: Fares are average values for month of December: as of 16th Oct, 2017

<strong>Outlook for Jazeera airways in India</strong>
Jazeera has in the past shown the courage to take bold decisions and grab opportunities that presented itself as illustrated by selling its leasing business in 2015 that comprised of 15 aircraft fleet. The decision transformed the firm into an asset-light, debt-free company, allowing it to further grow its profitable airline business.

India is a dynamic business and tourist destination that has shared close ties with Kuwait for many years. Jazeera Airways will target the over 900,000 Indian nationals residing in Kuwait (Ch-avitation). In addition roughly 13,000 tourists from Kuwait traveled to India in 2015 offering more opportunities in this segment and an expected to growth rate of 10% annually (Times of Kuwait). Given the Indian market growth plans, two more aircrafts are scheduled to be introduced by year-end.

The company has introduced long-term parking facility at airport last year. Under its ‘Next big thing’ value enhancing projects, it has also taken initiatives of exclusive Business Class lounge, in -flight broadband internet. In addition the successful establishment of a dedicated terminal at Kuwait International Airport is expected to be functional by Q1 2018 (Jazeera Airways H1 2017 presentation). It will isolate the passengers traveling on its airplanes from the congested terminals common for rest of the airlines, thus boosting the airlines appeal as compared to competitors.

Overall, the opportunities on the Indian route are lucrative and with limited airlines offering direct flight services, Jazeera stands to gain. The airlines combines several advantages starting from its low cost fares, convenient frequencies and other value added services which will certainly make this move fly.

		<Title>[:en]GCC Air quality - Are government measures sufficient?[:ar]جودة الهواء في دول مجلس التعاون الخليجي- هل تَكفي التدابير التي اتخذتها الحكومة؟[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">

<strong>Air Quality – Cause for concern</strong>
The extent of air pollution is higher than the global average in all GCC countries with Qatar and Saudi Arabia having alarming levels of PM<sub>2.5</sub>. As per a study by WHO, Saudi Arabia accounted for 4 among the top 50 cities having the highest average yearly air pollution with Riyadh and Jubail making it to the top 10.

<strong>What can be done?</strong>
Stricter emission norms and transparency in disclosure of industrial emissions must be encouraged by policy-makers for better pollution management. Rigorous implementation is as important as setting up a regulatory framework to make sure that the industries fall in line in accordance to the required standards. Also incentives have to be provided so that industries find it cost effective to comply with environmental standards.
GCC countries are among the highest per capita consumers of water and electricity in the world. This increases the need for fuel and energy, subsequently affecting air quality. Hikes in tariff and reduction of subsidy along with creation of awareness regarding minimal energy consumption would go a long way to reduce the level of pollution.

<strong>Renewables and Electric Vehicles – The way to surge forward</strong>
Use of renewables would be a step in the right direction. It will reduce the need for oil drilling and also help reduce emissions. The potential for solar power generation is high as GCC countries have the advantage of being geographically located in a region receiving regular sunlight with solar insolation levels (measure of solar radiation energy received on a given surface area in a given time) as high as 6.5 kWh/m² per day. Costs associated with renewable energy have also come down making it a cost effective alternative to fossil fuels. All GCC nations have incorporated the use of renewable energy in their long term visions and have been taking steps towards achieving their targets. However, the commitment needs to stay in the longer term backed by necessary investments.

The Auto industry worldwide is undergoing a major change with the emergence of commercial electric vehicles, a change which could bring about massive reduction in vehicular emissions in the long run if embraced. Dubai has been aggressively promoting the usage of EV (electric vehicles) by offering incentives to users. New EV buyers will be able to charge their vehicles for free until 2019 and use free designated green parking spots across Dubai.

Dubai has also been taking measures to promote the concept of green buildings (The concept of creating sustainable structures which have minimal negative impact on the environment) by giving permits to buildings only if they are compliant to required environmental standards. 1433 green building projects have been completed in Dubai since 2010 helping UAE reach 9th rank globally for green buildings outside the US according to a report from the GBC (Green Building Council).

<strong>Outlook – Still hazy as it stands</strong>
Despite the current measures taken by the governments, air quality remains appalling with 100% of the GCC population living in areas exposed to particulate pollution higher than WHO guideline level. Such deterioration of the environment would lead to several health hazards thereby affecting the livability of the region. Although UAE has been in the forefront among GCC nations in the push towards a cleaner future, initiatives taken by its neighbors so far leave much to be desired. Most of all, the concept of sustainable development needs to be incorporated in every sector with a view towards causing minimum hazard to the environment. This can be achieved only if the regulatory authorities are proactive in their cause and efficient in their enforcement. Until then, the situation is unlikely to improve and is susceptible to further degradation.

<strong>Air Quality – Cause for concern</strong>
The extent of air pollution is higher than the global average in all GCC countries with Qatar and Saudi Arabia having alarming levels of PM<sub>2.5</sub>. As per a study by WHO, Saudi Arabia accounted for 4 among the top 50 cities having the highest average yearly air pollution with Riyadh and Jubail making it to the top 10. The situation is equally worse in terms of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions as Qatar ranks 1<sup>st</sup> in the world in terms of CO<sub>2</sub> emission per capita and contributes to 0.25% of the world’s total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions while housing only 0.031% of the world’s population.

<strong>Challenges faced by GCC education industry</strong>
Despite the growing government spending on education by gulf countries averaging 15.8% of government expenditure in GCC, the quality of education remain below par to global standards. It is reflected in high level of unemployment among youths with an unemployment rate as high as 27% (World Economic Forum).

While Gulf governments may be eager to prioritize the hiring of nationals particularly in the private sector, a significant gap in skillsets and cultural and structural barriers continue to hinder women’s economic inclusion. Women in the Gulf are nearly invisible from workforce in some sectors. Unemployed young women holding higher education indicate an abundance of wealth in human capital that is not being utilized to its full potential. In Saudi Arabia, as much as 80 percent of female job-seekers hold university degrees (Oxford Gulf & Arabian Peninsula Forum). In Qatar even though 60% of graduates are women, they represent less than 37% of the workforce as of 2016.

The shortage of teachers in the region is also the second highest in the world as teaching profession is of less interest to the locals who prefer to work in highly paid public sector jobs. Although region has a lower pupil-teacher ratio of 17 compared to the world average, the countries face challenges in recruiting highly qualified teachers. Growing demand for teachers at international schools in the UAE of at least 14,000 over the next five years and in Saudi Arabia of 183,600 by 2030 will pose further problems. Low availability of highly qualified teacher also result in lower level of knowledge transfer to students, which is clearly visible in poor ranking for GCC countries in skill diversity of graduate category, a component of Competitive index measurement. Effectively addressing these challenges together with tapping into the growth opportunities discussed below highlights the attractiveness of education industry in the region.

<strong>Improving the quality of education and increasing institutions offering international curriculum</strong>
The GCC governments have been trying to enhance the quality of education through a number of measures like establishing quality assurance authorities, setting up guidelines, and encouraging technology-driven education. The government’s commitment to improve the quality of higher education and closing the skill gap between graduates and industry, could open opportunities for more private and foreign universities to come up in GCC.

However, in the past four schools including Oxford English School were closed down by SEC in Qatar as they did not meet the education standards in line with the country's drive to ensure the best learning conditions and levels for students. In addition, few foreign higher education institutions in Qatar and Saudi also had to face a setback due to recruitment challenges and government control in fees structure.
But growing enrollments ratio and government understanding the need of quality private institutions points to much more optimism. Subsequently domestic access to high-quality education will also contain the migration of citizens and expatriates seeking education abroad to an extent. Currently, educational projects worth over USD 50Bn are in different stages of development across GCC nations, with the Saudi Arabia on top of the leaderboard. King Faisal University in Saudi Arabia is the largest project with an estimated value of USD 14.7Bn followed by The Sabah Al-Salem University in Kuwait, worth USD 3.0Bn.The popularity of international schools in the GCC region is also on a rise due to the presence of a large number of expatriates coupled with the desire of the local residents to send their children to institutions offering high-quality education. In 2015, the UAE international schools have generated a revenue of USD 2.5 Bn annually, accounting for 7% of the global tuition fees (The National).

<strong>Growing Youth population base and number of Enrollments</strong>
The region is experiencing growing base of youth population with people in age group less than 15 years expected to reach 13.5Mn by 2020 representing 23% of the entire population while one third of the population will be below 25 years (United Nations Population Division). The above conditions have translated into enrollment growth across the GCC’s education sector, particularly in private enrolments which grew at CAGR of 7% from 2010 to 2015. In 2015, private schools accounted for as much as 70% and 57% of primary and secondary enrolments in UAE and Qatar respectively.

<strong>Increasing M&A deals and high margins a sign of huge growth potential</strong>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

The growth prospects has already attracted significant interest in the education industry investment landscape as the number of announced private equity and M&A transactions has increased to 24 transactions in the period from 2014 to 2016.

Amanat Holdings has acquired a 16 percent stake in the UAE education provider Madaares in 2016, aiming to cash in on the booming sector. Dubai based Gems Education purchased stakes in four academic institutions during 2013-2014. One of the major cross-border deal was the acquisition of National Training Institute in Oman by Babcock International Group of the UK. GEMS Education that runs 88 schools in UAE and abroad, registered a profit of USD 131.5 Mn in 2016, more than doubling the profit from previous year.

<div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion</strong>
Going forward, the rising awareness among parents regarding the importance of quality pre-primary education is going to be the key driver of growth. Saudi Arabia aims to build 1,500 nurseries by 2020 and UAE aims to increase pre-primary gross enrollment ratio to 95% under its Vision 2021. The tertiary segment is another promising segment for which enrolments are forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 5% from 2015-20 to 2.47mn in 2020, with Qatar and UAE expected to grow the fastest at a CAGR of 9% each during the period (GFH). This will subsequently convert into rise in enrollment rates for higher education thus providing huge scope for both private and public institutions.</div>[:ar]<div style="text-align: justify;">

The total power generated through renewables in the GCC has grown from a meagre 20 GWh in 2010 to 620 GWh in 2015. But looking at the bigger picture, it constitutes to less than 1% of the total power generated in the region while the global figure is at 23.3%. Europe and North America stand at 34.2% and 22% respectively in 2016 with Norway leading the way with 97.87%.

Norway has long been a pioneer in renewables with focus on clean energy despite having oil reserves comparable to countries like Oman. Prudent energy policies over the last few decades have enabled them to adopt renewables at a very early stage thereby allowing their oil resources to be used for exports. This has not only helped their economy grow, but also helped them achieve it without foregoing environmental sustainability.

While there is a huge scope for improvement in the GCC countries, we need to take into consideration the fact that historically, power generation through fossil fuel has been cost-effective for them. As renewables were not a lucrative option for energy production, there was no urge in considering alternatives. But the landscape has been changing lately as rapid urbanization has increased the need for energy. This has in turn led to increase in domestic consumption of resources and rise in air pollution which are forcing the hand of GCC countries to look at renewables.

<strong>Cost of Renewable Energy</strong>
Globally, there has been a reduction in LCOE(Levelised Cost of Energy) (LCOE is calculated by dividing lifetime cost of project divided by the lifetime Energy production of project. LCOE is used to compare the relative cost of energy produced by different energy-generating sources) ranges of renewable energy sources between 2010 and 2016 with Solar PV’s weighted average LCOE coming down by more than 50% from USD 350/MWh to  USD 140/MWh. This brings the cost of power production by solar energy within the range of fossil fuels.

Cost of production of renewable energy is competitive in the GCC despite the recent fall in the prices of fossil fuels. The LCOEs of the PV projects at utility scale in the GCC region are comparable to the LCOE of electricity generation from oil when oil is priced at USD 20 per barrel. With crude oil priced at around USD 50 per barrel now, the case for greater integration of solar PV in the oil-based power sectors is strong.

<strong>What if 5% of total power is produced through renewables?</strong>
From an economic standpoint, we look at the savings made if there is a change in the power mix. We take the case of UAE, in 2016, only 0.23% of the total power in UAE was produced through solar energy. If it grows gradually to 5% by 2020, we estimate that it could translate into cumulative savings of around USD 4.1 Bn in the next 5 years through savings from cost of production and the export of saved oil.

<strong>Aggressive targets and sizable investments </strong>
Globally, renewable power generating capacity saw an increase of 9% in 2016 compared to the previous year. Investment flow towards renewables has been steady with the spending exceeding USD 200 bn every year for the past 7 years. New investments of USD 264.8 bn was seen in 2016 with main focus on solar power closely followed by wind power. In the same year, renewables accounted for an estimated 62% of net additions to global power generating capacity. GCC countries have also made sizeable investments over the past few years and have set their long term targets.

Saudi Arabia, world’s biggest exporters of crude oil is moving towards the construction of its first utility-scale wind-power project at Dumat Al Jandal. It also plans to develop 30 solar and wind projects over the next decade as part of a $50 billion program to increase power generation and reduce its oil consumption.

Kuwait, one of the earliest advocates of renewable energy in the Middle East has set its sight to meet 15% of its energy requirements from renewable resources by 2030. Construction is now in progress for Phase I of the 2GW Shagaya Renewable Energy Park. Al-Abdaliyah Integrated Solar Combined Cycle plant is another power generation project under construction has an overall capacity of 280 MW. Kuwait has also planned to issue a tender to build the estimated USD 1.2 billion Dibdibah solar-power plant in the first quarter of 2018.

The United Arab Emirates is investing USD 163 billion in clean energy projects to ensure that half of the country’s power needs are generated from renewable sources by 2050. Dubai’s 13MW first phase of the Mohammad Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park received the International Renewable Energy Certificates (I-REC) issued in 2017, making it the first in the region to adopt the I-REC (I-REC is a voluntary system for international trade in renewable-energy certificates.) system.

<strong>Renewable energy targets of GCC countries</strong>

The late adoption of renewables in the GCC countries could be attributed to the abundance of fossil fuel and their cost effectiveness in the past decades. With majority of the power being produced by conventional sources it would take time for the shift to materialize. Considering the impact on the Power sector as a whole and the employment opportunities it generates could also be major reasons for this procrastination. Further, policies have generally been revolving around Oil while environmental sustainability has not been considered a priority. However, going forward the reducing cost of solar power generation, advancements in technology, favorable geographic conditions and the increasing need to sell more oil to compensate the lower prices would now make renewables an economical and environmentally viable option for power generation. As it stands, the growing investments in the past few years towards renewables could very well pave way for a paradigm shift towards a balanced energy dependency between fossil fuels and renewables in the years to come.

The late adoption of renewables in the GCC countries could be attributed to the abundance of fossil fuel and their cost effectiveness in the past decades. With majority of the power being produced by conventional sources it would take time for the shift to materialize. Considering the impact on the Power sector as a whole and the employment opportunities it generates could also be major reasons for this procrastination. Further, policies have generally been revolving around Oil while environmental sustainability has not been considered a priority. However, going forward the reducing cost of solar power generation, advancements in technology, favorable geographic conditions and the increasing need to sell more oil to compensate the lower prices would now make renewables an economical and environmentally viable option for power generation. As it stands, the growing investments in the past few years towards renewables could very well pave way for a paradigm shift towards a balanced energy dependency between fossil fuels and renewables in the years to come.

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">

The total outlets in UAE for food services were 16,000+ in 2015 which is expect to expand by 17.4% annually to reach 19,000+ by 2020 (KPMG report). The market size for food and beverage (F&B) in UAE was measured at USD 14.27Bn and is expected to grow at a CAGR of more than 9% to reach USD 22.32Bn by 2020. While an affluent population with more mouths to feed is a positive indicator for the economy and for the F&B industry, it brings with it a host of challenges. In a country where indigenous food production is near to impossible, a growing F&B sector will have to face several pain points to survive.

<strong>VAT may prove to be a bump in F&B industry growth</strong>
UAE have already imposed tax on selective goods and beverages such as tobacco, soft drinks, and other harmful products to be collected from Q4 of current year. In addition, the Value added tax (VAT) on most goods and services will be introduced in 2018. While introduction of VAT is likely to impact the purchasing power of consumers in the short run, it will also affect the F&B companies as they will have to incorporate VAT systems in their accounting, update IT infrastructure, train staff to be VAT-compliant, renegotiate supply contracts etc. In the long run if the government periodically increase the tax rate consumers will become more selective or may even resist buying certain food products. This can be an impediment to the growth of the F&B industry. For example, dairy products, juice and carbonates are the categories that will be hit the most with the introduction of VAT as these commodities are more price sensitive. The VAT effect is likely to offset the growth of dairy products by USD 280Mn over the period 2018-2023, representing approximately 19.5% of the market size of 1.45Bn expected in 2018 (Euro monitor). Similarly revenue from beverages including juices, carbonates and bottled water is likely to come down by USD 300Mn from the baseline forecast after adjusting for VAT.

<strong>High cost of retail rentals</strong>
In the past 5 years, as the demand for retail space grew, the rentals in the UAE have soared at a much faster rate. In Dubai, the food capital of GCC, average rents have climbed by more than 9.5% CAGR from USD 703 per sq. m in 2010 to USD 1336 per sq. m as of Q1 2017 (Jone Lang Lasalle). While existing operators continue to expand their business, new international players are also entering the market. This heightened demand is driving rental costs and making it difficult for players in the F&B sector leading to drying up of their profit margins. For prime locations, retailers are asked to pay a significantly higher premium as compared to the current market rates. Operators are also being charged in proportion to the number of customers visiting the stores thus limiting the scope for superior returns. While several F&B outlets, particularly restaurant chains, are engaging in lease models that allow revenue sharing to decrease costs, small and mid-size foodservice retailers who do not have multiple lines to boost their sales will have a more severe impact.

<strong>Growing health awareness may slow down frequency of eating out</strong>
Gut-busting meals served in fast-food restaurants are placing the health of UAE residents at risk. People consume a large quantities of carbohydrates and fats in every meal. A combination of unhealthy eating and lack of exercise has given the UAE the dubious distinction of being the country with the second-highest incidence of diabetes in the world. With the fast-paced life convenience foods and snacks such as chips, muffins or other unhealthy choices have become inherent part of daily diet. However, with increasing awareness among people about the negative impact on health, the frequency of dining out specially fast food items is likely to slow down booming fast food category to an extent as consumers will switch to eating fresh food and healthier meals self-cooked. Also adjusting to the changing preferences of consumer will impact the margins of the outlets in short term as players will have to incur cost to integrate wider range of healthier food items with the existing food offered at the outlets.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>
F&B industry will continue to be an important driver of the overall development of the economy, as UAE attempts to reduce its dependence on petroleum industry and evolve into a more diversified nation. The growth of F&B industry will have to face many pain points, therefore effectively managing the challenges will be the key to maintain sector’s current growth trajectory. While the country is blessed with a growing population which will offer abundant opportunities for the F&B sector, issues such as food price inflation, employee costs, quality and innovation will play major roles going forward.

<strong>Full Service carriers facing more trouble compared to low cost carriers</strong>
Emirates, the largest airliner in GCC faced pressure from increasing competition and poor travel demand in 2016. Non-fuel cost for Emirates went up by 8% YoY in 2016 as a result of expansion of network. Many of its new routes remained under-occupied and average passenger yield declined by 7.2% in the same period.

Etihad airways started operations in 2003, with the desire of competing with Emirates Airlines which was then the regional leader. The national carrier spread its wings around the world through acquisitions. As of December 2016, it had stake in seven airlines in various countries. Air Berlin (Germany) and Alitalia (Italy) in which Etihad holds 49% and 29.2% stake respectively went bankrupt in 2016. While Etihad continues to report profits on standalone basis its investment portfolio have clearly been a drag.

Other full service carriers in the gulf, Kuwait Airways, Saudia, Gulf Air and Oman Air have been reeling under heavy losses. Oman Air faced one of its biggest loss in 2016 of USD 337mn making its net worth negative. The auditors of Oman Air have even raised concerns about the surmounting debt levels.

According to the State Audit Bureau, Kuwait Airways incurred losses to the tune of USD 422 million during the period between 2014 and 2016. Higher labour cost was one of the major reasons for the airline’s lack of profits. Kuwait Airways operates with 353 employees per fleet while Jazeera and Emirates have an employee per fleet ratio of 71 and 92 respectively. To turnaround the situation, Kuwait airways has planned to reduce its staff apart from ordering 25 new fleets and changing its livery to give a fresh feel of the airline to its customers. Privatization of the airline is expected to happen with government estimated to retain just 20% of the stake.

Saudi, the state owned airlines of Saudi Arabia has not disclosed its financial information, however, news articles indicate that the airlines has not been profitable owing to which the government has hived off the catering and ground handling divisions while it aims to complete the privatization process for civil aviation by the end of 2020.

Qatar airways was the only exception among GCC FSCs, as the addition of 13 new routes resulted in a 30% increase in profits during 2016 (YoY). However, affected by the gulf spat, it is currently facing blockade to 22 destinations. The blockade and re-routing is expected to affect the profits in 2017.

Gulf airliners, namely, Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways (often referred to as ME3) are tough competitors with the western airlines Delta, American and United. ME3 has opened new routes to the US and Europe, thereby increasing competition and bringing down the prices in these routes. America’s airliners have earlier raised concerns about the subsidy received by the ME3 from their respective governments, especially for oil. Middle Eastern Airliners have faced threats about restrictions on the routes permitted for operation and retracting the code-sharing agreements they share with US and European airlines. Such measures could further deteriorate the prospects for ME3 that are already confronting various other issues.

<strong>Low Cost Carriers – So far so good</strong>
While the low cost carrier (LCC) concept has been relatively new to the region, the story has mostly been of success so far. Air Arabia, Jazeera and Fly Dubai are running profitability, by rationalising routes and keeping costs low. The LCC business model is gaining popularity in Middle East also because of the cheaper prices, point to point services, lower turnaround time and strong value proposition. This has translated into a dedicated set of customers setting them apart from the long haul travellers.  As a result, LCC segment (AirArabia, FlyDubai, Jazeera and Flynas) registered a strong growth in terms of scheduled capacity of about 50% in last decade compared to Full Service Carrier segment which grew by mere 7%.

<strong>Will the current scenario be a turning point for GCC Aviation?</strong>
Full service carriers (FSC) are facing larger problems compared to the LCCs. Gulf airliners need to revisit their business models, as rapid expansionary plans through acquisitions in other airlines and fleet expansion might prove costly. Emirates and Qatar Airways were successful mainly because they offered best-in-class service to their customers, such as on-time departures (almost 90%), on-board services and airports that hosted world class infrastructure. Privatization could be a solution as it would help to rationalize costs, bring world class management to the industry and improve the quality of services offered to customers. Apart from restructuring its organization, FSCs in the gulf must focus on improving their employee skill sets that will set service quality standards.

Management of gulf airlines need to fasten their seat belts and work tirelessly to revamp their business model and face competition from within and outside the region, else some of them are surely heading for hard landing!

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">

In Saudi Arabia, there are more than 35 companies that are licensed to provide insurance services, further there are 150+ companies that offer insurance support services and allied activities. Together, they generated business, as measured by gross written premium, worth USD 9.9bn last year. However, the profitability of the sector remains low and inadequate. Almost half of the companies reported losses and even among those that reported profits, less than half of them were able to earn higher returns than their capital costs. Thus, effectively, three-fourths of the companies were depleting their capital.

<strong>Figure: </strong>Percentage of firms that register losses and those which earn less than their capital costs

<div style="text-align: justify;">

While certain insurance players especially those who are backed by international players such as Allianz Saudi Fransi Cooperative Insurance Company (Allianz), AXA Cooperative Insurance company (AXA) Bupa Arabia (Bupa), Metlife AIG-ANB Cooperative insurance (Metlife) and those which are subsidiaries of Saudi Arabian banks – Al Rajhi company for cooperative insurance (Al Rajhi), SABB Takaful company (SABB) have deep pockets to tide over the situation, smaller players are bound to struggle for their survival.

Lower profit levels in the sector are attributed to the high expense ratio (expenses associated with acquiring, underwriting and servicing premiums by net premiums earned) of the firms. The sector is largely fragmented and as a result, high commissions are being paid to brokers to gain business volumes. Further, the presence of large number of player’s increases competition and often premiums are priced so low, that the loss ratio increases (difference between premium earned and claims settled). Together, for most companies’ loss and expense ratio (also known as, combined ratio) exceeds 100% implying an underwriting loss and unprofitable business.

Interestingly, despite the presence of large number of players, insurance industry in Saudi Arabia is characterized by high degree of concentration with the top five players accounting for over 60% of market share. The rest who run smaller operations compete fiercely to win the remaining share, exerting pressure on all participants in the sector. With most insurance players being publicly listed the need to perform and deliver is enormous. Larger insurance players enjoy higher economies of scale which enable them to profitably undercut their smaller rivals, while smaller players struggle to establish their feet in the competitive but promising landscape.

Smaller players in order to survive in the competitive market, where their profits are largely squeezed, could consider merging with one another and consolidate their operations. Though the talks of consolidation in Saudi Arabia insurance sector have been echoing for long, nothing ever materialized. The small players despite facing financial difficulties were reluctant to relinquish control over their businesses. Driven by the attractive growth potential, the sector commanded rich valuations even for the loss making smaller ones. This made acquisition of small players illogical at such lofty stock prices.

Note: Size represents market capitalization of the firm

In the past, faced with a similar situation in Saudi Arabian banking sector the regulator - Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) successfully oversaw the consolidation of the sector and reduced the number of players to just 12. Similarly, the insurance market regulator should come forth with policies that would encourage consolidation, prevent predatory pricing and restore healthy competition among the players.

In this regard, Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) recently introduced a regulatory change which required the players to implement actuarial pricing for their policies. In actuarial pricing system, premiums are calculated by actuaries based on loss and expense expectations, so as to deliver an underwriting profit in normal circumstances. The new rule was introduced to effectively end the practice of predatory pricing wherein the insurers were selling their policies at low premiums, which often led them to register losses.

Stock market has taken cognizance of this fact; subsequently, the stock prices of insurers which have been struggling to make profits have been hit hard and witnessed declines by almost 50% in their value. This effectively lowered their valuations and makes them an attractive candidate for acquisition.

Merger and Acquisitions’ (M&A’s) have been on the rise in Gulf region since the oil price fall. High profile mergers to realise economies of scale and save on operational costs were witnessed such as, IPIC & Mubadala and National Bank of Abu Dhabi and FGB. In March 2017, small insurance players in Saudi Arabia - Al Ahlia Cooperative Insurance and Gulf Union Cooperative Insurance had reported that initial talks for merger are on. Recently, Bloomberg reported that The Mediterranean & Gulf Insurance & Reinsurance Co, popularly known as MedGulf is evaluating options to sell its stake. We believe, the sector is in the cusp of consolidation with cheaper valuations, better regulatory environment and improvements in profitability.

In Saudi Arabia, there are more than 35 companies that are licensed to provide insurance services, further there are 150+ companies that offer insurance support services and allied activities. Together, they generated business, as measured by gross written premium, worth USD 9.9bn last year. However, the profitability of the sector remains low and inadequate. Almost half of the companies reported losses and even among those that reported profits, less than half of them were able to earn higher returns than their capital costs. Thus, effectively, three-fourths of the companies were depleting their capital.

<div style="text-align: justify;">

While certain insurance players especially those who are backed by international players such as Allianz Saudi Fransi Cooperative Insurance Company (Allianz), AXA Cooperative Insurance company (AXA) Bupa Arabia (Bupa), Metlife AIG-ANB Cooperative insurance (Metlife) and those which are subsidiaries of Saudi Arabian banks – Al Rajhi company for cooperative insurance (Al Rajhi), SABB Takaful company (SABB) have deep pockets to tide over the situation, smaller players are bound to struggle for their survival.

Lower profit levels in the sector are attributed to the high expense ratio (expenses associated with acquiring, underwriting and servicing premiums by net premiums earned) of the firms. The sector is largely fragmented and as a result, high commissions are being paid to brokers to gain business volumes. Further, the presence of large number of player’s increases competition and often premiums are priced so low, that the loss ratio increases (difference between premium earned and claims settled). Together, for most companies’ loss and expense ratio (also known as, combined ratio) exceeds 100% implying an underwriting loss and unprofitable business.

Interestingly, despite the presence of large number of players, insurance industry in Saudi Arabia is characterized by high degree of concentration with the top five players accounting for over 60% of market share. The rest who run smaller operations compete fiercely to win the remaining share, exerting pressure on all participants in the sector. With most insurance players being publicly listed the need to perform and deliver is enormous. Larger insurance players enjoy higher economies of scale which enable them to profitably undercut their smaller rivals, while smaller players struggle to establish their feet in the competitive but promising landscape.

Smaller players in order to survive in the competitive market, where their profits are largely squeezed, could consider merging with one another and consolidate their operations. Though the talks of consolidation in Saudi Arabia insurance sector have been echoing for long, nothing ever materialized. The small players despite facing financial difficulties were reluctant to relinquish control over their businesses. Driven by the attractive growth potential, the sector commanded rich valuations even for the loss making smaller ones. This made acquisition of small players illogical at such lofty stock prices.

Note: Size represents market capitalization of the firm

In the past, faced with a similar situation in Saudi Arabian banking sector the regulator - Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) successfully oversaw the consolidation of the sector and reduced the number of players to just 12. Similarly, the insurance market regulator should come forth with policies that would encourage consolidation, prevent predatory pricing and restore healthy competition among the players.

In this regard, Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) recently introduced a regulatory change which required the players to implement actuarial pricing for their policies.

		<Title>[:en]Healthcare in Saudi Arabia – where are the opportunities?[:ar]الرعاية الصحية في المملكة العربية السعودية: أين الفرص؟[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">

The government is benevolent to the extent that it pays for all medical charges even outside the country if it is deemed necessary for a patient to travel abroad for advanced healthcare facilities.

Saudi’s healthcare system is comprised of three service providers – the Ministry of Health (MoH) hospitals, government hospitals and private hospitals. However, gaps are evident in the services offered to the people.

The kingdom is projected to require 15,888 beds in 2018, accounting for almost 50 per cent of total requirements in the Gulf Cooperation Council. The health ministry has commissioned few projects to bridge the gap in healthcare infrastructure, so given the increase in demand it is vital that private players’ participation is encouraged – otherwise health infrastructure might lag behind.

In terms of financial stimulus, the government can choose from multiple options to offer incentives to private players. Public private partnership projects are expected to be the show-starter for improving private participation in various sectors in the kingdom.

One such PPP project is the Saudi Trans Sadara Company and China International Development and Investment Corporation Limited (CIDIC) joint venture to build four private hospitals in Dammam, Jubail, Riyadh, and Jizan, with a total project cost of $350m. These hospitals are expected to be fully operational by the end of 2017 and are expected to generate more than 2,000 jobs for young Saudi nationals in the fields of nursing, procurement, marketing, administrative affairs, pharmacy and safety and security.

Another segment in healthcare where there is immense opportunity is drug manufacturing. There are approximately 200 pharmaceutical companies (mainly retailers) in Saudi Arabia, registered with the Ministry of Health. European suppliers largely dominate the market.

Due to low domestic pharmaceutical production in Saudi Arabia, approximately 85 per cent of the drugs that are sold are imported. This opens the gates for generic drug manufacturers in the country – especially when you consider the cost aspect. At present more than 70 per cent of all prescription drugs sold in Saudi Arabia are patented, which are usually more expensive than generics owing to the R&D and compliance costs involved.

A growing population and increasing instances of lifestyle related diseases opens up a huge market for generic drug makers, with patients’ cost-consciousness likely to be driven by an expected decline in government support for healthcare in the coming years.

Local players hold a market share of around 25 per cent and predominately manufacture generic drugs. It is expected that the domestic drug manufacturers will have the opportunity to capture higher market share in the coming years, provided regulation is amended to be favourable for fostering generic drugs.

The Saudi Arabian medical device production sector remains in its nascent stages and imports account for 92 per cent of market supplies – 21 per cent of which from the United States. The total expenditure on medical equipment is expected to steadily increase and reach $3m by 2020 at a compound annual growth rate of 6 per cent. In general, medical equipment manufacturing is capital intensive and requires technology and skill transfer from established players in the field.

Joint ventures and public private partnerships with countries that have advanced technology and expertise in equipment manufacturing would be a viable option for Saudi Arabia to start with.

Recent developments in information and communication technology (ICT) have changed business models in all industries including healthcare. Saudi Arabia, with its well-established ICT infrastructure, offers an excellent meeting place for IT solutions to enhance healthcare services offered. Saudi’s e-Health policy aims to implement a programme in order to achieve its vision of a ‘safe, efficient health system, based on the care centred on a patient, standard-oriented, and supported by the e-Health’. These strategies were launched in 2011 in two phases, each one extending for five years.

There is a long way to go in order to make the country’s healthcare facilities IT enabled in terms of patient management systems, hospital information systems, quality controls for suppliers and service providers and integrated pharmaceuticals and insurance claims. Private participation can be channelled into the area of providing healthcare firms with IT-enabled services in the country to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of health operations.

Health insurance penetration also remains low at 0.8 per cent of the GDP in 2015, indicating ample scope for the growth of health insurance in the country. Saudi Arabia mandates compulsory health insurance for expatriates and visitors. On the other hand various awareness creation measures have been initiated to encourage nationals to insure life and health. Medical support from the government can also be expected to decline in the coming years, so we estimate the health insurance premiums in Saudi Arabia will continue growing.

<img title="Health insurance premiums ($m)" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Healthcare_in_Saudi_Arabia_Marmore_fig1.jpg" alt="Health insurance premiums ($m)" />

Saudi Arabia’s Takaful insurance market is expected to be vibrant in the coming years. Given the fact that Saudi Arabia restricts commercial insurance, the demand for Takaful products is set to rise. Favourable demographics, availability of Takaful insurance companies and increased income levels are all set to drive the country’s Takaful insurance sector.

According to Marmore’s report on Saudi healthcare, the kingdom’s market share of the GCC healthcare sector is the highest in the region at 54.4 per cent – equivalent to $26bn. With future demand almost certain to grow, private sector participation is set to increase. In some areas such as medical equipment manufacturing, international players might collaborate with local players to increase their domestic production.

The current situation presents a need as well as an opportunity for the development of private healthcare in Saudi Arabia but ensuring smooth transition and functioning lies with the policy makers.

Despite Saudi Arabia’s huge population and the growth witnessed over the past few years, the penetration levels of were lower than UAE and Bahrain. Lower penetration and favourable government policies would serve as strong growth factors.

<strong>Market Size of Insurance Industry</strong>
Saudi Arabia Insurance has a penetration rate of mere 1.5% in 2015 and compared with the developed nations is grossly under insured. With a large population of 32 Mn and strong GDP growth of over 3% there is a lot of potential for the market to grow (IMF Data).

<img src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Saudi_Insurance_fig1.jpg" alt="Insurance Penetration (premiums as %25 of GDP)" />
However, it may be limited by Saudi Arabia’s social welfare system, which for the most part is considered generous. Saudi Arabia’s cooperative insurance contributions stand at USD 5.4 billion for 2012 and is projected to reach USD 8.5 billion by the end 2016 making Saudi Arabia the single largest Islamic insurance market in the world.

<strong>Healthy Uptick in Motor and Health Insurance</strong>
Mandatory motor insurance is the main growth driver for the doubling of the premium since 2012. Saudi Arabia is the largest market for auto market for both new and used vehicles and also the largest auto parts markets in the GCC region. Saudi Arabia also imports a large number of automotive products which are then re-exported within the region. Government statistics are hard to come by on the actual number of new vehicle sales however annual sales is estimated to be in the range of 900,000 vehicles during 2015 which is double that of what was sold in 2006.

A total of USD 5.6bn is spent annually on road accidents and there were 526,000 accidents that took place in 2015 resulting in 17 deaths a day. Saudi Arabia is ranked 23rd on the list of countries witnessing the highest death rates in road accidents in the world. It is second among Arab countries in terms of road deaths. The usual causes of accidents include the use of cell phones while driving, ignoring the red light, overtaking from the wrong side and stopping in areas designated for people with special needs. All these factors serve as ideal reasons for increasing acceptance of insurance.

<img src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Saudi_Insurance_fig2.jpg" alt="Motor Insurance more than doubled since 2012 following its mandatory introduction (USD Bn)" />

Saudi Arabia was the first nation to provide medical insurance for foreign workers. A new regulation passed in 2006 made it mandatory for employers with more than 500 foreign workers to provide health insurance coverage. This was soon extended to include companies with more than 100 expatriate employees, and in September 2008, was extended, yet again, to companies with more than 50 expatriates. Under article 2 passed in July 2009, health insurance, for the first time, was made compulsory for all Saudis working in the private sector (including those on contract work) for individuals and for family members. Healthcare spending is expected to increase owing to growing and ageing population coupled with increase in lifestyle diseases like obesity and diabetes. Obesity is an endemic in Saudi Arabia with over 70% of adult population classified as obese.

<strong>Opportunities for Automation in Underwriting</strong>
Underwriting process is still carried out manually and underwriters have limited access to information. Automation will improve the efficiency by reducing the errors and rework involved. It can help in classifying and evaluating the risk involved based on the credit history. Due to shortage of efficient underwriting skills the insurers are forced to reinsure considerably. There has been a decline in the cession rates as the health and motor insurance have been made mandatory and maintained by primary insurers. Among the GCC countries, Saudi Arabia has the lowest cession rate but still is high compared to other countries. According to the KSA Reinsurance Regulations, companies must retain not less than 30% of the total written premiums and cannot cede more than 40% of its premiums to reinsurers without SAMA approval. Saudi Arabia had a cession rate of 32% in 2011 which has come down to 17% during 2014. The reduction in cession rates indicates that Saudi Arabia’s insurance have been able to better manage their risks themselves instead of passing them onto re-insurers. While the cession rate has gone down in KSA it is still higher than the global average of 10%.

<strong>Possible consolidation among the insurance players</strong>
The KSA insurance sector comprises of 35 companies. In addition to that, the KSA insurance sector also comprises of 79 licensed insurance brokers, 83 licensed insurance agencies, one licensed actuarial company, 15 licensed loss assessor companies, 10 licensed claims settlement companies, and eight approved insurance advisors (Standard &  Poor’s Ratings Direct).The top three market players dominate the industry with 54% of the total gross premium. Such high level of market concentration and lack of scale for small players could drive consolidation or merger of small players.

		<Title>[:en]Healthcare in Saudi Arabia - Will the future tide move towards private sector?[:ar]الرعاية الصحية في المملكة العربية السعودية - هل ستكون هناك حركة متقلبة في المستقبل نحو القطاع الخاص؟[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">

Saudi Arabia has one of the fastest growing populations in the GCC region, indicating a spiraling future demand for healthcare facilities. Despite huge government spending in healthcare facilities and growth of the sector in the past, health care infrastructure in Saudi Arabia needs to be elevated to match international standards. Apart from the constraints on government expenditure in the current scenario of lower oil prices, healthcare market also needs to overcome challenges such as dependency on imports for medicines and medical equipment, domination of expatriates in the workforce and business environment that is not conducive for the growth of private sector.

<a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/saudi-healthcare/">According to Marmore’s report on Saudi Healthcare</a>, the market share of Saudi Arabia in healthcare sector would be the highest in the GCC region with 54.4% amounting to USD 26bn. Wide range of reforms and measures might be required to cater to the market.

Firstly, private participation in healthcare services can help to bridge the service gap. Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects are expected to be the show starter for improving private participation in various sectors in the Kingdom; healthcare sector would be no different. Saudi Arabian government has planned to establish a unit under the Ministry of Economy that would plan and facilitate ‘Public Private Partnerships’ for execution of the stalled infrastructure projects.

One such PPP project is the Saudi Trans Sadara Company and China International Development and Investment Corporation Limited (CIDIC) joint venture to build hospitals in Dammam, Jubail, Riyadh, and Jizan, at a total project cost of USD 350mn. These hospitals are expected to be fully operational by the end of 2017 and is expected to generate over 2,000 jobs for young Saudi nationals in the fields of nursing, procurement, marketing, administrative affairs, pharmacy, and safety & security.

Secondly, proper regulations and legal framework must be established while introducing Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects in the health care segment to reduce undue competition and increase in costs of services. Private participation can also be channelled in the area of IT-enabled healthcare services in the country. Another concern about the healthcare industry in Saudi Arabia is its fragmented nature. Fragmentation, in terms of service providers, pharmaceuticals and insurance providers paves way for consolidation, both within the business segment and across verticals.

With the future demand almost certain to grow, and the government’s vision to increase private participation by 2030, healthcare could be one of the most sought after industry. Starting from increasing PPP projects and consolidation through mergers and acquisitions, it is quite possible that the healthcare market could witness a sea of change in the coming years. The current situation presents a need as well as an opportunity for the development of private healthcare in Saudi Arabia. Ensuring smooth transition and functioning lies with the policy makers.

Apart from the constraints on government expenditure in the current scenario of lower oil prices, healthcare market also needs to overcome challenges such as dependency on imports for medicines and medical equipment, domination of expatriates in the workforce and business environment that is not conducive for the growth of private sector.

<a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/saudi-healthcare/">According to Marmore’s report on Saudi Healthcare</a>, the market share of Saudi Arabia in healthcare sector would be the highest in the GCC region with 54.4% amounting to USD 26bn. Wide range of reforms and measures might be required to cater to the market.

Firstly, private participation in healthcare services can help to bridge the service gap. Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects are expected to be the show starter for improving private participation in various sectors in the Kingdom; healthcare sector would be no different. Saudi Arabian government has planned to establish a unit under the Ministry of Economy that would plan and facilitate ‘Public Private Partnerships’ for execution of the stalled infrastructure projects.

One such PPP project is the Saudi Trans Sadara Company and China International Development and Investment Corporation Limited (CIDIC) joint venture to build hospitals in Dammam, Jubail, Riyadh, and Jizan, at a total project cost of USD 350mn. These hospitals are expected to be fully operational by the end of 2017 and is expected to generate over 2,000 jobs for young Saudi nationals in the fields of nursing, procurement, marketing, administrative affairs, pharmacy, and safety &amp; security.

Secondly, proper regulations and legal framework must be established while introducing Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects in the health care segment to reduce undue competition and increase in costs of services. Private participation can also be channelled in the area of IT-enabled healthcare services in the country. Another concern about the healthcare industry in Saudi Arabia is its fragmented nature. Fragmentation, in terms of service providers, pharmaceuticals and insurance providers paves way for consolidation, both within the business segment and across verticals.

With the future demand almost certain to grow, and the government’s vision to increase private participation by 2030, healthcare could be one of the most sought after industry. Starting from increasing PPP projects and consolidation through mergers and acquisitions, it is quite possible that the healthcare market could witness a sea of change in the coming years. The current situation presents a need as well as an opportunity for the development of private healthcare in Saudi Arabia. Ensuring smooth transition and functioning lies with the policy makers.

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">

The expats in the GCC region collectively remitted USD 105bn in 2015, increasing at a CAGR of 15% from USD 53bn at the end of 2010. Saudi, UAE and Kuwait have accounted for more than 80% of the outflow during 2010-2015.  Saudi Arabia, with leading outward remittance among the GCC, countries is also consistently ranked second globally after the USA. The robust oil prices and vibrant economic activity in Saudi Arabia led to a surge in urban development, which in turn, increased demand for foreign labor during the 2010-2013 period. Between 2010 and 2013, the remittances from Saudi Arabia grew at a CAGR of 14%. With the drop in the oil prices since-mid 2014, the staggering growth of remittance subdued to a CAGR of 3% between 2013 and 2015. Marmore estimates a 2% drop in 2016 resulting in outward remittances of USD 41.3bn compared to USD 42.3bn in 2015.

Oil prices and capital investment have very direct impact on the expatriate population and outward remittances. The increase in oil prices resulted in increased investments and subsequently led to expatriate population flocking to Saudi to meet the demand in the labour market. With the increase in expatriate workforce in Saudi, increase in remittance outflow was an expected phenomenon.

The increase in oil price (Avg USD 83.6) during the 2005-2014 period compared to the previous 11 years period (Avg USD 22.61), led to significant increase in capital investments. The average capital investment during 2005-2014 was USD 161bn compared to USD 36.3bn during 1994-2004. Bulk of the increase in investments was channelized for capital investments which require intensive manual labor. This resulted in expatriate workforce growing by two-folds, from 3.4mn non-Saudi male expatriates at the end of 1994 to 6.9mn at the end of 2015 and thus, the increased remittance outflow.  During 2005-2015 period the average annual remittance was almost 2.6 times the remittances outflow during 1994-2004 period.

<strong>Oil Price, Investments & Remittance</strong>
The decline in oil prices has impacted the Saudi economy. According to IMF estimates, the real GDP growth of Saudi is projected at 1.2% during 2016, down from 3.5% in 2015. Lower oil revenues are forecasted to culminate into current and fiscal deficits at approximately 9% and 14% of GDP, respectively, in 2016.  Saudi ran a fiscal deficit of USD 97.9bn in 2015 and the deficit for the year 2016 is expected at USD 83bn by IMF. Since the decline of oil prices (mid-2014), the accumulated financial reserves (estimated at USD 608bn at end-2015) served as cushion for Saudi Arabia to manage the deficits. However, with the banks investing in Government debts instruments coupled with Government’s increasing deposits withdrawal, credit available by banks to lend to other sections of the economy such as businesses and retail took a hit. This tightening of liquidity and rise in interbank interest rates, which exerted pressure on credit growth took a hit private sector growth.

Saudi Arabia is also forced to cut investment spending by almost two thirds as it wrestles with the oil price rout. Fund allocation for projects, such as the Riyadh Metro and Jeddah’s King Abdulaziz International Airport, fell to USD 6bn in 2016, down from USD 17bn in 2015. According to press reports, spending on transport and infrastructure is expected to fall by 63% in 2016, as the kingdom axes capital expenditures in a bid to trim deficit. Saudi Arabia is spending USD 9bn a month from its foreign reserves which is almost 1.5 times the reserves spent during 2008-2009 to sustain the budget deficit. This has also constrained the country’s public spending capacity drastically, and as a consequence, Saudi Arabia is reviewing thousands of projects valued at about USD 69bn and weighing plans to cancel more than USD 20bn of projects and slash ministry budgets by a quarter to fix squeezed finances. The construction sector which employs a vast majority of the expatriate population would be hit hard by the cancellation of the projects. The capital investments increased by 4% in 2015 compared to 2014 and is expected to decrease by 10% in 2016 by IMF.

As per IMF’s estimates, the oil price is expected to continue to remain in the mid USD 50 range over the next two years. Despite the economic diversification efforts, embarked on by Saudi, the GDP growth is expected to be constrained in the forthcoming years.  The constrained economic activity would substantially reduce the demand for the expatriate labor force in the country. Investment spending is a key source of employment for both expats and locals. In the past, high levels of investment spending has resulted in the quick expansion and growth of expat population, especially male.

The gloomy prospects of the two strong driving forces i.e. oil price and investments, that create demand for expatriate population, indicate headwinds faced by the remittance industry going forward.

<em>Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it-George Santayana..</em>.

There is not one year that passes by without any crisis. Some are big and tectonic in nature (like the Global financial crisis in 2008) while others have a limited but powerful impact like Asian Financial crisis. When macro crisis hits the economy, it is natural that companies risk management systems are tested to the core. However, a company’s risk management architecture can also be tested without a macro crisis background. This can be simply due to weak risk management systems and processes in the company. History is replete with several company specific examples of financial risk management crisis starting from Bankers Trust derivatives sales scandal in 1994 to LTCM hedge fund failure in 1998 to Libor fixing scandal in 2012. Sometimes the lines can be blurred between a general disaster and a company failure. For eg., 2011 Fukushima and nuclear accident can be viewed as market disaster, while it can also be viewed as  risk management failure of Tokyo Electric Power Co.

As finance professionals and CEO’s, most of us are trained to focus on performance and results. However, extracting performance and showing results is also concomitant with assuming risk. Return and Risk are two sides of the same coin. If we do not have our eyes on risk, we will not be able to distinguish between risks that one can take on a regular basis, risks that one can take occasionally and risks that one should avoid altogether. Without the ability to discriminate in this fashion, focus purely on performance and results either can be short term or can produce side effects that can sink the whole ship.

From a business enterprise point of view, the higher the risk in a proposition the higher the return. However, while the return comes from the core business environment, risks can emanate from various sources. A company can face “financial risks” like market risks (interest rates, exchange rates, and stock prices), credit risk and liquidity risk. It does not stop here. The company also faces “non-financial” risks, which can be hard to quantify. Some examples of this would be operations, accounting, taxes, legal, regulations, and finally model risks. A company stands in the middle between these financial and non-financial risks. Therefore, the main challenge for a financial risk manager is to recognize, measure and manage these risks. Depending on the business in consideration, certain risks may be closer to heart than others may. For eg., a multinational agri business that procures raw materials from different countries and sells the final product in various countries will have currency risk at the heart of its operations. Since the operations are global, it will encounter commodity price risk, foreign exchange risk, equity market risk, and interest rate risk not to mention credit risk ( as its customers tend to purchase on credit) and operational risk where weather related risk can play havoc . Another challenge is to factor risk resulting from environment, social and governance factors what are famously termed as ESG risks.

Once we capture relevant risks, the next challenge is to quantify or measure them. Fortunately, several readymade tools are available to use in this sphere for a financial risk manager. The most commonly practiced is the Value at Risk (VaR) that estimates the minimum loss that a party would expect with a given probability over a specified period. Hence, the key issues here are to estimate appropriate time periods, confidence intervals and methodologies. There are advanced tools as well in the form of Monte Carlo Simulation that estimates VaR by generating random scenarios and can handle complex relationships among risks. For the credit risks, probability of default and recovery rate will be key measures. The agri business example given earlier will have this risk measure for its buyers who buy the product mostly on credit.

The third key challenge after identifying and measuring is to manage the risks. For e.g., once a firm wide VaR is computed and segregated business area wise, the next question to ask is how much risk can the company take? The answer to this important question will tell us if we are properly covered or exposed. Technically, this is termed as “risk budgeting” which enables us to answer questions like “where do we want to take risk” and therefore which unit can be allocated more bandwidth to assume more risks. In the absence of risk budgeting, all business segments can take equivalent risks disproportionate to their contribution to business goals. In most cases, credit risks are managed by limiting exposure to a party and by marking to market the trading positions. It is also possible to manage this risk through collateral. Some companies have also used Special Purpose Vehicles (SPV’s) that have higher credit ratings than the companies that own them.

A related aspect of “risk budgeting” is capital allocation. Risk management has become a key tool for allocating capital across various business units of a risk-taking enterprise. The capital allocation process is a blend of quantitative mathematical process using statistical programs embedded with qualitative decision-making process.

Managing risks also involves hedging risks through derivatives and other instruments. Corporates normally work closely with the treasury department of banks that provide such customized solutions to clients to hedge risks. However, there are steep costs involved in hedging and will constitute insurance premiums that should be constantly paid. The financial risk manager should eventually take the call on managing the risks through hedging or through other business tools explained above.

In conclusion, it is well know that there is no return without risk and rewards certainly go where risks are taken. However, there is a difference between taking known risks and taking unknown risks. It is important to know what we do not know (known unknowns). Risk should be discussed openly so that it can be fully understood and therefore better managed. While many firms do think about risks, few firms show discipline and consistency in terms of a rigorous approach. A good FRM process will ensure there is consistency and disciple in in identifying, measuring and managing risks. Presently two professional organizations are dedicated to imparting education and skills in the area of risk management globally. They are Global Association of Risk Professionals (GARP) and Professional Risk Managers International Association (PRMIA). Companies should encourage CFO’s to acquire these certifications so that best practices can be introduced and followed in the area of risk management.

Last but not the least, financial risk management can easily deduce to a mathematical and statistical process. However, it should be understood that people, not mathematical models, manage risks. Financial risk management, though has rigorous quantitative processes developed over time, has also a good element of common sense embedded. It is better to be approximately right than to be precisely wrong![:ar]<span style="color: #ababab; font-family: futura-lt-w01-book, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;">This article was originally published in</span> The Global Analyst <span style="color: #ababab; font-family: futura-lt-w01-book, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;">November 2017 issue.</span>

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">

<img src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/MENA-Market-Trends-July-2017-MMR.jpg" alt="MENA Market Trends – July 2017" />

Value traded in July reflected the positive sentiments in the market, with volume traded increasing by 8% while the turnover in the market increased by 10%. All MENA markets, barring Abu Dhabi, Qatar and Egypt, witnessed gain in liquidity. Kuwait and Bahrain bourses evidenced 89% and 52% increase in value traded. The increase in liquidity attributed to the base-effect, especially due to poor trading activity in the previous month of Ramadan. In terms of valuation, P/E of Morocco (20.1x), Saudi Arabia (14.5x), and Kuwait (14x) indices were at premium, while the markets of Bahrain and Dubai trading at 10x and 9.6x were relatively cheap among MENA markets.

Blue chips were mostly positive, except the Blue chips from Saudi, which performed negatively in July. Saudi Arabia's stock market declined on the back of weak second-quarter corporate earnings. KFH (10.8%), DP World (9.9%) and QNB (8.7%) were the top performers. Kuwait Food, Al Rajhi and Saudi Electric Company plunged by 14.3%, 10.5% and 6.5% respectively.

<strong>Developments in the Saudi Debt Markets</strong>

<strong>Issuance of Domestic Debt  </strong>
Saudi Arabia is emerging as a prominent player in the region for debt issuances and making significant strides in developing the domestic capital market. Last month, Saudi Arabia's government made its first offer of riyal-denominated Islamic bonds to domestic investors. The yields for the domestic issuance were kept in-line with the yields on the USD 9 billion of sukuk issued in the international markets. Aligning the two yields was imperative to create a deep market in tradable government debt, a long-term objective of Saudi Arabia's economic reforms.

<strong>Moody’s Gets Approval to Rate Saudi’s Corporates           </strong>
Another significant development related to the Saudi’s capital market was that of Moody's obtaining a license to operate rating activities in the Kingdom. With the approval of Moody’s all three major rating agencies – Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody’s now operate in Saudi. The granting of approval highlights Saudi Arabia's Capital Markets Authority (CMA) efforts to develop its corporate debt markets.

<strong>Oil Market Review</strong>
IPE Brent crude gained 9.9% this month, making it the best performing month this year. Several series of events contributed to the rally of the oil price. Saudi Arabia's vow to cut exports in August helped kick off the rally, while a sharp drop in U.S. crude and fuel stockpiles kept the momentum going. OPEC also has announced that some of its prominent members including Saudi and Russia are planning to meet in early August to discuss ways to improve compliance with a deal to limit output.

All MENA markets, barring Abu Dhabi, Qatar and Egypt, witnessed gain in liquidity. Kuwait and Bahrain bourses evidenced 89% and 52% increase in value traded. The increase in liquidity attributed to the base-effect, especially due to poor trading activity in the previous month of Ramadan. In terms of valuation, P/E of Morocco (20.1x), Saudi Arabia (14.5x), and Kuwait (14x) indices were at premium, while the markets of Bahrain and Dubai trading at 10x and 9.6x were relatively cheap among MENA markets.

Blue chips were mostly positive, except the Blue chips from Saudi, which performed negatively in July. Saudi Arabia's stock market declined on the back of weak second-quarter corporate earnings. KFH (10.8%), DP World (9.9%) and QNB (8.7%) were the top performers. Kuwait Food, Al Rajhi and Saudi Electric Company plunged by 14.3%, 10.5% and 6.5% respectively.

<strong>Developments in the Saudi Debt Markets</strong>

<strong>Issuance of Domestic Debt  </strong>
Saudi Arabia is emerging as a prominent player in the region for debt issuances and making significant strides in developing the domestic capital market. Last month, Saudi Arabia's government made its first offer of riyal-denominated Islamic bonds to domestic investors. The yields for the domestic issuance were kept in-line with the yields on the USD 9 billion of sukuk issued in the international markets. Aligning the two yields was imperative to create a deep market in tradable government debt, a long-term objective of Saudi Arabia's economic reforms.

<strong>Moody’s Gets Approval to Rate Saudi’s Corporates           </strong>
Another significant development related to the Saudi’s capital market was that of Moody's obtaining a license to operate rating activities in the Kingdom. With the approval of Moody’s all three major rating agencies – Fitch, Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody’s now operate in Saudi. The granting of approval highlights Saudi Arabia's Capital Markets Authority (CMA) efforts to develop its corporate debt markets.

<strong>Oil Market Review</strong>
IPE Brent crude gained 9.9% this month, making it the best performing month this year. Several series of events contributed to the rally of the oil price. Saudi Arabia's vow to cut exports in August helped kick off the rally, while a sharp drop in U.S. crude and fuel stockpiles kept the momentum going. OPEC also has announced that some of its prominent members including Saudi and Russia are planning to meet in early August to discuss ways to improve compliance with a deal to limit output.

Institutional constraints such as barriers to invest across boundaries, limitations on repatriation of investment income, varying corporate governance standards, higher transaction costs and currency risk have been put forth as possible reasons. Interestingly, closer to home regional mutual funds in GCC markets suffer from home bias as well, despite the region being largely homogenous and frictional costs to invest across the region are largely non-existent.

The primary goal of a fund manager is to maximize returns while minimizing risk. However, the presence of varying country-level exposures among fund portfolios in achieving a common goal – to outperform the benchmark index (S&P GCC Composite Index for conventional equity funds and S&P GCC Composite Sharia Index for Islamic equity funds) – is puzzling, as this bias is a result of conscious and intentional move made by the fund manager. Indeed by overweighting domestic exposure the fund managers are adding on to the risk that they could have diversified away.

Possible explanation for such behaviour could be attributed to the perceived informational advantage of fund managers over their country stocks. Fund managers are more familiar with domestic stocks and thus have a higher degree of confidence in their ability to generate outperformance through active management. For instance, local fund managers could talk with employees, managers, and suppliers of the firm, they could obtain key information from local media, social events, and the close personal ties with senior management, all of which could provide them with better information than their regional peers and provide a distinct advantage. In part, home bias could also be an extension of “<em>confirmation bias</em>” as fund managers may simply feel more comfortable about their domestic investments when they keep hearing about them in local media. Country specific systemic risk factors such as political risk or poor corporate governance practices could also influence the fund manager allocations resulting in home bias.

<strong>An analysis of the GCC funds</strong>
In our analysis we observe that the level of home bias among GCC mutual funds (equity) is heterogeneous in nature. Funds in markets such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait exhibit significant home bias (greater than 10% overweight to home market) while United Arab Emirates (UAE) funds have been observed to exhibit moderate home bias (greater than 5% but less than 10% overweight of home market). Funds based out of Qatar and Oman exhibit relatively minimal home bias. Based on our observation, Bahrain funds did not exhibit any home bias. In fact, GCC funds domiciled in Bahrain had underweighted their domestic country.

Note: Cells denote over weightage of domicile country in fund compared with benchmark;<strong>Liquidity, Trade Costs & Home bias</strong>
In general, home bias, especially by Saudi Arabia and UAE fund managers could be justified due to their larger size and presence of multiple sectors. Greater size and diversified nature of their markets enable them to be relatively liquid in comparison with other markets in the region. Higher liquidity would also reduce direct transaction costs and market impact costs. On the other hand, fund managers based in Kuwait and Oman with home bias should reassess their portfolio allocation due to illiquid nature of their markets on account of relatively smaller market size and concentrated sector exposures.<strong>Impact on Performance</strong>
All the funds considered in our study that exhibit home bias has underperformed their respective benchmark in the past 1year. Though GCC markets are largely inefficient and have greater scope for alpha generation through active management, the results suggest that excessive home bias could take a toll on the fund performance. Interestingly, the Qatar-based fund with least home bias had also underperformed the benchmark.

Note: Performance as of April, 2017<strong>Conclusion</strong>
As per our analysis, funds exhibiting home bias have underperformed the benchmark index. In light of this finding, fund managers of GCC funds should avoid the temptation of overweighting their country of domicile as they run the risk of being over-run by foreign funds that need not have home bias. Additionally, fund investors especially the institutional investors could have home bias as an additional parameter of analysis while selecting regional fund managers.</div>[:ar]<div style="text-align: justify;">

Institutional constraints such as barriers to invest across boundaries, limitations on repatriation of investment income, varying corporate governance standards, higher transaction costs and currency risk have been put forth as possible reasons. Interestingly, closer to home regional mutual funds in GCC markets suffer from home bias as well, despite the region being largely homogenous and frictional costs to invest across the region are largely non-existent.

The primary goal of a fund manager is to maximize returns while minimizing risk. However, the presence of varying country-level exposures among fund portfolios in achieving a common goal – to outperform the benchmark index (S&amp;P GCC Composite Index for conventional equity funds and S&amp;P GCC Composite Sharia Index for Islamic equity funds) – is puzzling, as this bias is a result of conscious and intentional move made by the fund manager. Indeed by overweighting domestic exposure the fund managers are adding on to the risk that they could have diversified away.

Note: Cells denote over weightage of domicile country in fund compared with benchmark;<strong>Liquidity, Trade Costs &amp; Home bias</strong>
In general, home bias, especially by Saudi Arabia and UAE fund managers could be justified due to their larger size and presence of multiple sectors. Greater size and diversified nature of their markets enable them to be relatively liquid in comparison with other markets in the region. Higher liquidity would also reduce direct transaction costs and market impact costs. On the other hand, fund managers based in Kuwait and Oman with home bias should reassess their portfolio allocation due to illiquid nature of their markets on account of relatively smaller market size and concentrated sector exposures.<strong>Impact on Performance</strong>
All the funds considered in our study that exhibit home bias has underperformed their respective benchmark in the past 1year. Though GCC markets are largely inefficient and have greater scope for alpha generation through active management, the results suggest that excessive home bias could take a toll on the fund performance. Interestingly, the Qatar-based fund with least home bias had also underperformed the benchmark.

Note: Performance as of April, 2017<strong>Conclusion</strong>
As per our analysis, funds exhibiting home bias have underperformed the benchmark index. In light of this finding, fund managers of GCC funds should avoid the temptation of overweighting their country of domicile as they run the risk of being over-run by foreign funds that need not have home bias. Additionally, fund investors especially the institutional investors could have home bias as an additional parameter of analysis while selecting regional fund managers.</div>[:]]]></Content>

		<Title>[:en]Dual-Class Share structure: Answer to family business listing[:ar]هيكلة الأسهم ذات الفئة المزدوجة: الحل لإدراج الشركات العائلية في البورصة[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">

Dual Class Share (DCS) structure is a governance structure that provides certain shareholders with voting power or other related rights that is disproportionate to their shareholding. Typically, one share provides one vote; in case of dual class share structure, one class of shares offer one vote, while shares in another class could carry multiple voting rights or absolutely no voting rights. For example, Alphabet Inc. (parent company of Google) has different class of shares: class A ordinary shares that is traded on Nasdaq has one vote per share; and class B shares which is not publicly traded has 10 votes per share. This way, the founders who owned 92.5% of the class B shares, represented approximately 58.5% of voting rights and maintained control over the firm.

Historically, dual-class shares rose in popularity to thwart corporate threats. Dual class shares were used by UK companies in the 1960s to protect themselves from hostile takeovers. Similarly, the start of corporate raiders during 1980’s in the US led New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to reintroduce the structure.

Proponents of dual-class share structures say US newspaper businesses that floated their ventures in the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century majorly utilized the structure to protect editorial integrity from outside shareholder pressure. The ability to focus on building long-term value without worrying about short-term pressures from market is touted as a major advantage in dual class share structures.

In recent times, Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have embraced this structure when they intend to float their business, to prevent investors from interfering in the way they run their business. Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) in technology sector, Google, Facebook and LinkedIn have all had dual share structures; entrepreneurs argue that it would enable them to bring their ideas to the capital markets at an early stage, and simultaneously allow the companies to plan for the long term.

Presently, U.S (NYSE & NASDAQ), Canada & Sweden stock exchanges allow for dual class share structure. In U.K, ‘premium segment’ listing doesn’t permit while ‘standard segment’ listing allows multiple voting structures. Other stock exchange such as Singapore is reconsidering its earlier ban on dual class shares to win IPO businesses from its rival Hong Kong. Hong Kong lost out on an opportunity to list Alibaba in its exchange due to its existing ban on dual class stocks.

Closer to home, we could extend the argument to family businesses in GCC region which could benefit from introduction of multiple share structures in capital markets. Dual class shares would provide the necessary impetus for family businesses in the region to float their businesses; additionally it would also permit different dividend policies for different classes of shareholder thus enabling them to retain control over management and capital. Apart from traditional, family-run businesses, dual share structure would also incentivize start-up companies to consider Kuwait Stock Exchange as a potential listing venue. Greater flexibility in raising and managing capital would provide the market participants with wider range of investment opportunities. As a result, Kuwait Stock Exchange could become a comprehensive, vibrant and dynamic market that could draw both traditional family businesses as well as modern start-ups.

However, not all is rosy and dual share structure has its fair share of opponents. The founders of Snapchat in its recent IPO sold shares that were devoid of voting rights – a first among IPOs in the US. Founders of Google and Facebook have concentrated control by creating different classes of stock, but none have a class structure that has no votes at all. Many passive funds that track indices would be forced to own them, when they are included in major stock indices. These funds have raised an alarm and California pension fund, CalPERS dubbed the move as a banana republic approach to corporate governance.

Opponents of dual class share structure claim that lack of one-share-one-vote would prevent investors from acting as stewards of the company, and also dilute the management performance as there would neither the incentive to perform nor the fear of takeover by rival firm. They further fear that risks of expropriation - owners trying to extract excess private benefits, such as excessive remuneration for themselves to the agony of non-controlling shareholders, could also be exacerbated.

Poor management accountability could also arise from changing ownership structure. Activist investors, who could monitor, engage and hold the management accountable are short in supply. According to research, among OECD nations, structure of listed firms has moved away from direct ownership to intermediary ownership by professional asset managers, such as mutual funds, pension funds, hedge funds, Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) amongst others. Moreover, new class of investors such as high-frequency traders and short sellers have no incentive to engage with management or exercise their voting rights.

Meanwhile, various ideas for broadening the share types while protecting investors are being evaluated such as, setting limits on proportion of voting and non-voting shares, restricting issuance of new dual class structure shares post-listing, mandatory conversion of shares after certain time period or including a sunset clause so that they expire after a set period of time.

There is a need to revive and rejuvenate the Kuwait capital markets, especially after a series of delisting and tepid market performance. In this context, introduction and adoption of dual class share structure could be a progressive step for Kuwait capital markets and to position itself as a leading capital raising venue in the region. Family businesses that intend to publicly list but wouldn’t like to cede control in running their company, should be given a choice to do so.

 	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>When is the inclusion likely to happen: 2018/2019/2020?</strong></li>
</ol>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

MSCI has lauded the progress in Saudi Arabian capital market ushering its entry into the emerging markets. The kingdom will be third in the GCC league after UAE and Qatar that were included in the index in 2014. Thanks to plethora of reforms implemented by the Capital Markets Authority and Tadawul after 2015 when KSA was categorised as MSCI standalone index.

Saudi has progressed swiftly compared to UAE and Qatar that took six years to implement reforms to be a part of the index. Given the fact that MSCI is happy with the progress, let us look back at what they have done till now and why they are not very far from the inclusion.

One major impediment for Saudi Arabia in entering the MSCI EM was the T+0 settlement cycle which it had been following. Capital Market Authority (CMA) and Tadawul have changed the cycle from T+0 to a T+2 cycle on 23<sup>rd</sup> April 2017. This was a longstanding hurdle that has been cleared. Following the change in settlement cycle, Saudi Arabia also introduced short selling in April 2017. Liberalization on foreign ownership limit to 49% from the existing 10% in Saudi listed companies has been initiated and the definition of foreign institutional investors has been broadened to include sovereign wealth funds. Minimum value of assets under management for QFIs was reduced to 3.75 billion Saudi riyals (USD 1bn), compared with the current 18.75bn riyals (USD 5bn). CMA has introduced new corporate governance policies to ensure more accountability and transparency. The new policy is expected to be implemented from February 2018. In most of the other parameters, KSA is at par with the Qatar and UAE. Aramco is expected add USD 50 Bn to the Saudi market and completing the issue with domestic and retail investors alone would be close to impossible. Foreign institutional investors’ have a key role to play in the subscription. Fund managers prefer to invest in stocks and indices that are classified and tracked by agencies such as MSCI. An upgrade of the Saudi market to EM would provide impetus for fund managers to invest in the IPO. It is hence implicit that the CMA has made considerable work on the ground to achieve it. MSCI scheduled to start the review for Saudi’s claim to join emerging markets in June 2017, we can be expected to be a part of the index by 2018 as the review process takes eleven months.

</div>
<ol>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;" value="2"><strong>What will be Saudi Arabia’s weight in the index?</strong></li>
</ol>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

We have estimated the weightage of Saudi Arabia in the MSCI EM index to be 2.57% after considering the possible stocks that would be a part of the EM index and based factors such as free-float market capitalization and liquidity.

Institutional investors have expressed that it would be a perfect time for the index inclusion as Aramco IPO has also been planned during the same period. Provided that the IPO and index inclusion happens together, it is expected to lead to significant inflows from international funds into Saudi market (Source: EFG Hermes). Aramco’s market capitalization can be expected to be USD 50 Bn (5% of USD 1 trillion), which if added to the index would increase the weight to 3.71%.

</div>
<ol>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;" value="3"><strong>How much fund flows can be expected post inclusion?</strong></li>
</ol>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

UAE’ weightage in the EM index was 0.35% in 2014, which must have translated to a fund flow of USD 5.25 Bn.
However, the initial funds (three months after the inclusion) that entered UAE markets was USD 0.85 bn. The weightage of UAE stocks have almost doubled in the last couple of years, though the fund flow is still estimated to be about USD 2 bn.

Going by similar trends and assuming the traction in fund flows happen gradually, our estimates for Saudi Arabia’s fund flows in the initial phases (three to six months after inclusion) is around USD 6 to USD 7 bn and this could increase to USD 9 to 10 bn with the inclusion of Aramco (Source: Estimates based on UAE).

<strong>Concluding Remarks</strong>
2018 would be a year of rejoice for CMA and Tadawul if the MSCI EM inclusion happens as anticipated, but definitely not the time to rest on the laurels. Stories from other emerging markets would tell us why.

Dubai and Abu Dhabi markets soared 107% and 63% in 2013, the time when MSCI announced that UAE stocks would be a part of the emerging markets index in 2014. International investors poured money into UAE markets, especially as it was considered a safe investment destination in GCC. Economic growth was pushed back after the second half of 2014 with oil prices starting to fall as a result of which UAE markets tumbled in 2015. MSCI EM inclusion in 2014 was not enough to hold the investors. Similar was the case with Pakistan, which lost its EM status in 2008 after being a part of the index from 1990’s. Geopolitical tensions and poor economic growth led to the liquidity crunch in the Karachi stock exchange following which it was downgraded to Frontier markets. It has taken nine years since then for Pakistan to improve the liquidity position, instil confidence among the investors and bounce back to the EM status which is very likely to happen by the end of May 2017. These are instances that indicate Saudi Arabia cannot expect money to flow into its markets just because stocks are listed in the MSCI EM. Apart from the larger economic reforms planned which would be fundamental for the growth of Saudi markets, Tadawul and CMA will have to work further to streamline the process of registration for investors, protecting the rights of foreign players and encourage market making.

<img title="MSCI Accessibility Review" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/MSCI_EM_Marmore_Blog_fig1.jpg" alt="MSCI Accessibility Review" />

Looking at Hong Kong and Czech Republic, the two emerging markets that have received positive feedback from MSCI on all parameters used for evaluation in its accessibility review reveals that Saudi Arabia has more work to be done. Saudi Arabia’s regulations have to provide equal rights to foreign investors due to which it has been rated as needs improvement in the ‘openness to foreign ownership parameter’. Aspects of market infrastructure such as establishment of custodian, making provisions for short selling, stock lending and developing products such as exchange traded funds (ETFs) and hedge funds are areas that need focus. Investor registration and account setup will have to be established to ensure ease of market entry.

Saudi Arabia has been restructuring its economy to reduce its dependency on oil. Capital markets reforms and increasing foreign as well as institutional investor participation has been one of its main components. Given the vision Saudi aims to achieve in 2030, the CMA and Tadawul will have to work tirelessly to reform its market and build an investor friendly environment before and even after the inclusion in MSCI emerging markets index.

Foreign institutional investors’ have a key role to play in the subscription. Fund managers prefer to invest in stocks and indices that are classified and tracked by agencies such as MSCI. An upgrade of the Saudi market to EM would provide impetus for fund managers to invest in the IPO. It is hence implicit that the CMA has made considerable work on the ground to achieve it. MSCI scheduled to start the review for Saudi’s claim to join emerging markets in June 2017, we can be expected to be a part of the index by 2018 as the review process takes eleven months.

</div>
<ol>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;" value="2"><strong>What will be Saudi Arabia’s weight in the index?</strong></li>
</ol>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

We have estimated the weightage of Saudi Arabia in the MSCI EM index to be 2.57% after considering the possible stocks that would be a part of the EM index and based factors such as free-float market capitalization and liquidity.

Institutional investors have expressed that it would be a perfect time for the index inclusion as Aramco IPO has also been planned during the same period. Provided that the IPO and index inclusion happens together, it is expected to lead to significant inflows from international funds into Saudi market (Source: EFG Hermes). Aramco’s market capitalization can be expected to be USD 50 Bn (5% of USD 1 trillion), which if added to the index would increase the weight to 3.71%.

</div>
<ol>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;" value="3"><strong>How much fund flows can be expected post inclusion?</strong></li>
</ol>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

UAE’ weightage in the EM index was 0.35% in 2014, which must have translated to a fund flow of USD 5.25 Bn.
However, the initial funds (three months after the inclusion) that entered UAE markets was USD 0.85 bn. The weightage of UAE stocks have almost doubled in the last couple of years, though the fund flow is still estimated to be about USD 2 bn.

Going by similar trends and assuming the traction in fund flows happen gradually, our estimates for Saudi Arabia’s fund flows in the initial phases (three to six months after inclusion) is around USD 6 to USD 7 bn and this could increase to USD 9 to 10 bn with the inclusion of Aramco (Source: Estimates based on UAE).

<strong>Concluding Remarks</strong>
2018 would be a year of rejoice for CMA and Tadawul if the MSCI EM inclusion happens as anticipated, but definitely not the time to rest on the laurels. Stories from other emerging markets would tell us why.

Dubai and Abu Dhabi markets soared 107% and 63% in 2013, the time when MSCI announced that UAE stocks would be a part of the emerging markets index in 2014. International investors poured money into UAE markets, especially as it was considered a safe investment destination in GCC. Economic growth was pushed back after the second half of 2014 with oil prices starting to fall as a result of which UAE markets tumbled in 2015. MSCI EM inclusion in 2014 was not enough to hold the investors. Similar was the case with Pakistan, which lost its EM status in 2008 after being a part of the index from 1990’s. Geopolitical tensions and poor economic growth led to the liquidity crunch in the Karachi stock exchange following which it was downgraded to Frontier markets. It has taken nine years since then for Pakistan to improve the liquidity position, instil confidence among the investors and bounce back to the EM status which is very likely to happen by the end of May 2017. These are instances that indicate Saudi Arabia cannot expect money to flow into its markets just because stocks are listed in the MSCI EM. Apart from the larger economic reforms planned which would be fundamental for the growth of Saudi markets, Tadawul and CMA will have to work further to streamline the process of registration for investors, protecting the rights of foreign players and encourage market making.

<img title="MSCI Accessibility Review" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/MSCI_EM_Marmore_Blog_fig1.jpg" alt="MSCI Accessibility Review" />

Looking at Hong Kong and Czech Republic, the two emerging markets that have received positive feedback from MSCI on all parameters used for evaluation in its accessibility review reveals that Saudi Arabia has more work to be done. Saudi Arabia’s regulations have to provide equal rights to foreign investors due to which it has been rated as needs improvement in the ‘openness to foreign ownership parameter’. Aspects of market infrastructure such as establishment of custodian, making provisions for short selling, stock lending and developing products such as exchange traded funds (ETFs) and hedge funds are areas that need focus. Investor registration and account setup will have to be established to ensure ease of market entry.

Saudi Arabia has been restructuring its economy to reduce its dependency on oil. Capital markets reforms and increasing foreign as well as institutional investor participation has been one of its main components. Given the vision Saudi aims to achieve in 2030, the CMA and Tadawul will have to work tirelessly to reform its market and build an investor friendly environment before and even after the inclusion in MSCI emerging markets index.

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">

While the GCC equity markets came into prominence in the early part of the millennium the bond market took a back seat, primarily due to the lack of urgency to raise funds, ample liquidity in the system at low cost and certain cultural taboos. Family run organisations which control the majority of the economy were reluctant to expose their books to outsiders and sovereigns never had a dearth of capital.

<img style="width: 790px; height: 271px;" title="Outstanding bond/sukuk country wise | Oil price vs GCC Bond market growth" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GCC-bond-market_Marmore-blog-fig1.jpg? width=790&height=271" alt="Outstanding bond/sukuk country wise | Oil price vs GCC Bond market growth" />

The data collated by Marmore clearly indicates an uptrend in the number of issues that have been registered over the past five years. While sovereign issues witnessed huge interest from Europe and US, the corporate issues captured the Asian investors. Most of the sovereign issues were oversubscribed by at least 3X and corporate issues in the range of 3-14x. The strong demand has helped in better pricing and near to the initial guidance. The much talked about $17.5bn issue by KSA clearly evinces the optimism surrounding the market and how much the system is willing to absorb. 2016 was a year that also established the GCC bond market as a meaningful player in the Emerging market (EM) space. The region contributed to over 14% of the total capital raised via debt by EM that year.

Having successfully tested the market in 2016 we can expect repeat issues by all the GCC sovereigns in 2017. This year the corporates and sovereigns have already raised a record of $39bn out of which $15bn came through sukuks. Sukuks were largely ignored initially as regulations and investor awareness were limited and there was urgency to raise money. The recent KSA sukuk garnered $9bn and was oversubscribed by over 3.7x, this has encouraged other GCC countries to follow. Oman has already hired investment bankers for its issue. Aramco recently raised $3bn through a sukuk issuance. Other private corporates are also eager to access the debt market as bank lending becomes costlier. There clearly is a paradigm shift with regulators also providing an accommodative stance. Exchange houses in the region have started listing such issues creating visibility and liquidity.

The GCC bonds offer international investors diversification and a certain premium for its scarcity. They are not completely correlated to the externalities and usual economic problems surrounding other countries. The region is still very highly rated by agencies despite recent downgrades. They currently share a majority of the EM markets secondary trading space as well. With majority of the unknowns behind us, a more stable oil price, fiscal consolidation, rational spending and proactive decision making by governments, the evolution of the GCC bond markets has only begun.

<div style="text-align: justify;">

Value traded and volumes in March reflected a mixed market mood, with volume traded, dropping by 22% while the turnover in the market increased by 34.6%. All MENA markets, barring Saudi Arabia and Dubai, witnessed increase in turnover in March. Dubai and Abu Dhabi witnessed the maximum fall in liquidity with volume declining by 41% and 40% respectively. In terms of valuation, P/E of Morocco (19.18x), Kuwait (16.2x), and Qatar (15.06x) markets were at premium, 8while the markets of Dubai (9.39x), Egypt (9.4x), and Bahrain (10.06x) were the discount markets in the MENA region.

Many blue chips were in the red in April, while few companies such as National Bank of Abu Dhabi (NBAD) gained. The post-merger listing of NBAD and investors focus on specific stocks in the real estate and banking sector pushed the share prices of NBAD up by 7.8%. Mashraf Al Rayan’s stocks increased by 5.1% following positive earnings growth reported in Q1 2017 and increasing revenue from core operations. SABIC’s stocks gained 2.1% last month, as analyst expectations on the petrochemical sector remained positive. Petrochemical companies are expected to benefit from the higher prices of end products resulting in better earnings compared to the previous quarters. Industries Qatar and Kuwait Finance House were the stragglers, down by 11.7%, 7.3% and 7.2% respectively. Selling pressures in Qatar stock exchange especially in the large cap segment by GCC institutions dragged down the prices of many blue chips in Qatar.

<strong>GCC Projects on an uptick in Q1 2017, Saudi Arabia lags behind</strong>
Project awards in GCC reverted back in the first quarter of 2017 after remaining sluggish in 2016. Value of projects in GCC increased by 22.6% in Q1 2017 compared to the last quarter of 2016 while the increase was 16.1% on a year-on year basis. UAE was the star among GCC nations in terms of increase in projects’ spending, though the largest economy in the region, Saudi Arabia failed to cash in on the momentum. It was the only GCC country to report a fall in projects value by 29.3% in Q1 2017 (QoQ). The value of UAE projects awarded surged by 42.6% quarter on quarter in the first quarter of 2017, with both Dubai and Abu Dhabi seeing significant increase.

Oil and gas projects value expanded by 18.5% in Q1 2017 (QoQ), Kuwait being the forerunner followed by UAE in oil, while Oman topped in terms of investments in gas projects during the period. Kuwait has surpassed Qatar in the first quarter of 2017 becoming the third largest nation in the region in terms of value of projects being executed. However, concerns remain in Kuwait over the increasing delays and re-tendering of many big-ticket projects especially in utilities sector.

<strong>Oil Market Review</strong>
Brent crude declined by 2.08% in April 2017 declining to USD 51.73 compared to USD 52.83 at the end of March 2017. Concerns over increasing supply from U.S shale producers and Libya’s restart of production in Sharara oil field rattled the oil markets further in April. The confidence provided by OPEC’s commitments has not been sufficient to curtail the fall in oil prices.

The month witnessed the volume traded hitting the reds with a negative growth of 22%, in contrast with a hike of 34.6% in the market turnover, indicating a mixed market mood. All MENA markets witnessed an increased turnover in March, leaving behind Saudi Arabia and Dubai to battle a negative market environment. Dubai and Abu Dhabi hit the lows in liquidity, with volumes spiraling down by 41 and 40%, respectively. Drawing the limelight on valuation, the market witnessed the P/E of Morocco (19.18´), Kuwait (16.2´) and Qatar (15.06´) markets to be at premium, while their counterparts in Dubai (9.39´), Egypt (9.4´) and Bahrain (10.06´) to be the discount markets in the MENA region.

Blue Chips ended the month on a negative note, with most companies drenched in reds. Shares of Masraf Al Rayan hit the highs, touching down at an impressive 5.1%, the highest among the Blue Chips in GCC, with Ezdan Holdings (3.8%) seconding. Foreign institutional investors roped in fresh money into some Qatari companies while they withdrew from a few in the telecom sector. Fresh investments geared the share prices to clock a hike in Masraf Al Rayan. Ezdan holdings has also blared the roll out of its USD 2 Bn sukuk. The Saudi Telecom Company (STC) nailed five memorandums of understanding (MoUs) for 5G technology with its various compeers on the sidelines of the Mobile World Congress (MWC). It also banded with Oberthur Technologies to fathom the feasibility of eSIM technology that promises users to order, install and activate profiles over the air in a seamless and secure way. Projects and international collaborations announced by STC, the telecom operator tycoon in the MENA region, tipped its share price toward a 1.9% positive growth. The Qatari stocks, Ooredoo Qatar and Industries Qatar, were the laggards among the Blue Chips, shedding 8.9 and 7.7%, respectively. Selling of telecom, insurance and industrials by foreign institutional investors, coupled with the subsequent bullishness of the Qatari and GCC investors, marshaled the share prices down.

<strong>Kuwait International Bond Issuance</strong>
Kuwait has coffered USD 8 Bn through a dual tranche offering of 5- and 10-year notes and has launched a USD 3.5-Bn March 2022 bond at 75bp over Treasuries and a USD 4.5-Bn March 2027 note at plus 100bp. The absence of activity in the past shepherded the bond to being oversubscribed 3.2 times, with bids worth USD 29 Bn received, indicating hawkish investor sentiments toward debt markets. The current transaction surfaces up the fact that Kuwait holds the potential to source funds from the international debt markets in the times ahead, lead to domestic companies following suit and view foreign debt as a source of funding. The inclusion of international debt would make it easy for investors and analysts to estimate the risks of investing in the gulf state and at the same time make it easier for financial services firm to benchmark their products.

The final investor-type apportion for the 5-year bonds was as follows: 22% to banks and private banks; 60% to asset managers and 18% to agencies, pensions and insurance, while the final investor-type allocation for the 10-year bonds was 25% to banks and private banks; 68% to asset managers and 7% to agencies, pensions and insurance.

<strong>Oil Market Review</strong>
March 2017 witnessed the largest dip since July 2016 when Brent crude hit the all-time lows by clocking a slippery decline of 5%, touching down at USD 52.83. Poor commitment from the non-OPEC members to cut production was one of the reasons for the fall in oil prices. An initial jack up in oil prices at the start of the year opened the taps from rigs in the United States, thereby gearing up supply to the market and derailing the reduced production from the OPEC members.

Effect of lower oil prices and their impact on non-oil sectors was evident in the earnings performance of H2, 2016. Key sectors such as banking, telecom, real estate and construction all witnessed a fall in earnings. Banking and Telecom sector’s earnings declined by 7% and 29% during H2 2016 on a YoY basis. Poor performance of the former was due to tight credit and weak economic conditions, while the latter suffered from subdued performance of foreign subsidiaries, increased regulatory costs and network operating costs. Financial services (Earnings H2 2016 – USD 2.1Bn) performed well posting 23% growth in earnings during H2 2016 and an overall increase of 11% for the whole year 2016. Recovery of oil prices in the second half of the year helped Commodities (Earnings H2 2016 – USD 3.8Bn) sector to recover and post 19% growth in H2, 2016 earnings compared with same period in earlier year. For the whole year the commodities sector’s earnings increased by 1%.

Saudi Banks witnessed a 21% decline in earnings during H2 2016 as a result of bad loans, lower government spending and a host of other charges. Commodities sector was the star performer among the Saudi sector with earnings growth of 31% during H2 2016 following the rebound in oil prices post OPEC deal. Non-oil sectors such as financial services and real estate posted healthy growth in H2, 2016 as their earnings grew by 19% and 82%, respectively.

<strong>Kuwait</strong>
Kuwait’s overall earnings were almost flat, growing at 1.8% during H2 2016. Banking sector was a stand-out performer growing at 21.8% during H2 2016 compared to the same period last year.

Barwa real estate (H2 Earnings – USD 111Mn) suffered a loss during H2 2015 compared to the profits witnessed in H2 2016 while United Development witnessed a 22% increase in net profits.

<strong>Oman</strong>
Corporate earnings in Oman declined by 18% in H2 2016 led by poor performance in the banking and telecommunications sector which declined by 8% and 33% respectively. Oman’s commodities sector posted a net loss of USD 56Mn H2 2016 compared to USD 9Mn loss witnessed in H2 2015. Oman’s banking sector, which has the highest impact on overall earnings declined by 8% on the back of sluggish performance of major banks including – Bank Muscat, Bank Dhofar and National Bank of Oman.

<strong>Bahrain</strong>
Bahrain’s corporate profits posted a growth of 58% largely on account of low base effect. Banking, Commodities, Financial services witnessed positive performance during H2 2016.

We expect GCC corporate earnings to expand by 4.7% in 2017 over 2016 and reach USD 63.3Bn by the end of the year. Overall, we expect earnings growth for Kuwait, UAE and Saudi Arabia to be 8.3%, 5.8% and 4.6% respectively. Kuwait’s strong banking position is expected to be positively helped by better credit growth and governments infrastructure push. Saudi Arabia, one of the largest oil producers, is expected to benefit from the positive momentum in oil prices.

Fall in telecom earnings was despite the healthy performance by Ooredoo Kuwait (H2 Earnings – USD 90 Mn) which witnessed a 30% increase in its net profits.

<strong>United Arab Emirates</strong>
UAE earnings were flat during H2 2016. Earnings declined in key sectors such as Banks, Telecom and Real Estate by 3%, 6% and 2%, respectively. Earnings for Emirates NBD (H2 Earnings – USD 959Mn) and Abu Dhabi Commercial bank (H2 Earnings – USD 546Mn) declined by 8% & 16%, respectively. First Gulf Bank (H2 Earnings – USD 923Mn) and National Bank of Abu Dhabi (H2 Earnings – USD 721Mn), witnessed an earnings growth of 8% and 12% during H2 2016. Real Estate sector as a whole declined by 2% during H2 2016. Real Estate prices continued to decline even in the second part of the year. Dubai and Abu Dhabi’s apartment rents declined by 6% and 7% respectively. Commercial property rents in Dubai were comparatively stable.

<strong>Qatar</strong>
Qatar’s banking sector witnessed a 4% decline in earnings owing to tight liquidity and market conditions. Qatar’s real estate sector rebounded in H2 2016 with its overall earnings growing by 167% during the period. Barwa real estate (H2 Earnings – USD 111Mn) suffered a loss during H2 2015 compared to the profits witnessed in H2 2016 while United Development witnessed a 22% increase in net profits.

<strong>Oman</strong>
Corporate earnings in Oman declined by 18% in H2 2016 led by poor performance in the banking and telecommunications sector which declined by 8% and 33% respectively. Oman’s commodities sector posted a net loss of USD 56Mn H2 2016 compared to USD 9Mn loss witnessed in H2 2015. Oman’s banking sector, which has the highest impact on overall earnings declined by 8% on the back of sluggish performance of major banks including – Bank Muscat, Bank Dhofar and National Bank of Oman.

<strong>Bahrain</strong>
Bahrain’s corporate profits posted a growth of 58% largely on account of low base effect. Banking, Commodities, Financial services witnessed positive performance during H2 2016. Construction sector posted a net loss while Conglomerates declined by 59% during H2 2016. Aluminum Bahrain witnessed a turnaround in the H2 2016 earnings as it posted USD 74Mn compared to the loss of USD 19 Mn in H2 2015.

We expect GCC corporate earnings to expand by 4.7% in 2017 over 2016 and reach USD 63.3Bn by the end of the year. Overall, we expect earnings growth for Kuwait, UAE and Saudi Arabia to be 8.3%, 5.8% and 4.6% respectively. Kuwait’s strong banking position is expected to be positively helped by better credit growth and governments infrastructure push. Saudi Arabia, one of the largest oil producers, is expected to benefit from the positive momentum in oil prices.

According to Marmore’s recently released Monthly Market Review, most MENA bourses rebounded from a positive start to 2017, to close the month of February in the red. Bahrain, Jordan and Qatar were the exceptions, with the respective indices closing the month at 3.5%, 2.2% and 1%. Egypt, Morocco and Saudi Arabia were the laggards in February, falling by 4.8%, 2.5% and 1.8%, respectively. Kuwaiti Price and Weighted indices also fell by 0.7% and 0.8%, respectively. Profit taking dragged stock markets down in the region, at the month’s close, after quarterly earnings failed to inspire investors. Shares in Egypt slumped after speculation that the finance ministry would recommend a 0.2% stamp duty on stock transactions for both sellers and buyers. Some analysts attributed the sell-off more to the strengthening of the Egyptian pound, which has spurred foreign investors to take profits. An uninspiring global market environment and no fresh news to stimulate trading, most MENA bourses slumped to post loses. S&P GCC close the month at 100 points, down 0.8% from the previous month.

Value traded and volumes in February reflected the market mood, with volumes and value traded dropping 38% and 26%, respectively. All MENA markets, barring Jordan, Oman and Qatar, witnessed a fall in market liquidity in February, while Oman was the sole exchange to post positive increase in volumes. Value traded in Kuwait continued to rise, and stood at USD 6.7bn for 2016-YTD, compared to USD 9.5bn for the whole of 2016. In terms of valuation, P/E of Morocco (20.2x), Kuwait (16.9x), and Qatar (15.4x) markets were the premium markets in the MENA region, while the markets of Egypt (8.7x), Dubai (9.9x), and Bahrain (9.9x) were the discount markets.

Blue Chips had a mixed month, with most companies posting a gain. Shares of DP World (UAE), Saudi Electric and First Gulf Bank (UAE) posted the largest gains for February, at 12%, 8.4%, and 5.4%, respectively. Kuwait Projects (-10.7%) and National Commercial Bank (Saudi, -5.6%) lagged behind the rest. DP World witnessed rise in annual volume growth, as the company handled 3.2% more containers YoY in 2016, helped by higher volumes in Europe and Asia, but its home terminal processed less cargo amid challenging global market conditions. The company also signed a five-year extended agreement with leading strategic procurement company Tejari following a "highly successful" partnership. Commercial Bank of Dubai recorded a net profit of AED 1bn for the year 2016, 5.9% lower compared to AED 1.07bn for the last year mainly due to prudent provisioning. Dubai-based telecom operator du reported a 9.79% decrease in 2016 profit, despite a 3.16% increase in revenues, due to 10% increase in royalty fee, making this the ninth consecutive quarter the company has reported declining profits. Logistics conglomerate Agility tumbled 6.7% after saying it was seeking to settle by arbitration a USD 380m dispute with Iraq's government over its investment in the Iraqi telecommunications industry.

<strong>Saudi Secondary Equity Market</strong>
Saudi Arabia launched a secondary equity market, for smaller and family-run firms, which aims to improve companies' access to capital and expose them to market disciplines in an economy dominated by small and mid-sized enterprises, most of which are family-owned.

All seven stocks listed on Saudi Arabia’s new Nomu parallel equity market surged during their first day of trading on 26th Feb 2017, as investors flocked to put their money in the exchange. Al Omran Industrial Trading, Development Works Food, Raydan Cuisines and Restaurants, Abdullah Saad Mohammed Abo Moati for Bookstores and Arab Sea Information System all surged 20 per cent – the maximum daily allowed amount – from their IPO prices.

The new index forms part of the kingdom’s economic development programme, and is designed to reduce pressure on banks by providing alternative sources of capital for smaller businesses, while at the same time offering lighter listing requirements than the main Tadawul stock exchange. The new market also allows companies listed on Nomu to move up to the Tadawul, after trading for at least two years.

<strong>Oil Market Review</strong>
Brent crude fell by 0.2 per cent to close the month at USD 55.6 per barrel, having maintained the price level at above USD 50 per barrel since the beginning of the year. Oil prices continued to slip as rising US supplies offset OPEC cuts, which have been surprisingly compliant with the agreed output curbs, and could improve in coming months as the laggards, UAE and Iraq, catch up with their targeted declines.

According to Marmore’s recently released Monthly Market Review, MENA bourses had a positive start to the year 2017, with nearly all markets ending the first month in green. Kuwaiti Price and Weighted indices led the charge, rising by 18.9% and 12.4%, respectively, followed by Bahrain (6.8%). Saudi Arabia and Oman were the only markets to register a fall in January, falling by 1.5% and 0.1%, respectively. Various reasons are being touted for the 14-day consecutive rally in the Kuwait bourses, but a look at the top five stocks by value traded suggest that main activities are largely in large cap companies. The appointment of the new chairman and a series of market reforms may have led to investors hoping that steps might be taken to boost foreign inflows, following the regional peers UAE, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Also, with Pakistan upgraded to MSCI Emerging Markets Index, Kuwait and other countries could see increased representation in the MSCI Frontier Markets Index.
<img title="MENA Market Trends – January 2017" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/MMR_Feb_17_fig1.jpg" alt="MENA Market Trends – January 2017" />

With the fall in oil output, in line with the OPEC agreement, many of the Saudi sectors were affected, with losses posted in Banking, Retail, Hotels & Tourism and Transport sectors. Corporate earnings across all sectors rose by 2% in 2016, but earnings in Banks and Materials companies fell by 5% and 8%, respectively. S&P GCC grew by 1.6% in January, to close the month at 101 points.

MENA markets witnessed an upswing in momentum in January, with volumes rising 53% and value traded 3.7%. All MENA markets, barring Saudi Arabia, witnessed a rise in market liquidity in December, with Kuwait, Bahrain and Abu Dhabi leading the charge. Value traded in Kuwait stood at USD 3.9bn in January, compared to USD 9.5bn for the whole of 2016. In terms of valuation, P/E of Morocco (20.7x), Kuwait (17.9x), and Qatar (15.4x) markets were the premium markets in the MENA region, while the markets of Egypt (7.7x), Dubai (9.9x), and Bahrain (10.0x) were the discount markets.

Blue Chips also had a positive month, with Kuwaiti large caps dominating the best GCC performers in January. Shares of Zain, Kuwait Finance House, National Bank of Kuwait and Kuwait Projects posted double-digit growth, at 20.7%, 14.8%, 12.3% and 12%, respectively. Saudi Telecom (-7.6%) and Emirates Telecom (-4.8%) lagged behind the rest. Kuwait Finance House and National Bank of Kuwait also posted positive growth in 2016 earnings, as revenues grew, while Saudi Telecom witnessed an 8% fall in profits. Q4 profits for SABIC were positive for the first time in ten quarters, which indicated that  the worst might be over for Saudi Arabia's petrochemical sector, since the fall in oil price and government austerity measures raised the cost of gas feedstock. Qatar National Bank has reported a 10% jump year-on-year in net profit to USD 3.4bn for the year ended 2016, helped by stronger core earnings.

<strong>New Year Reforms and Bond Issuances</strong>
Saudi Stock Exchange is set to introduce settlement of trades within two working days of execution (T+2) during the second quarter of 2017. Tadawul also published draft rules for short-selling, and the borrowing and lending of securities. Presently, trades must be settled on the same day, which has inconvenienced foreign investors in particular, as they must have large amounts of money on hand before trading.

The Saudi cabinet approved an IMF-backed value-added tax (VAT) to be imposed across the Gulf, following the slump in oil prices. A 5% VAT will be levied on certain goods, following an agreement with the GCC in Jun’16. The move is in line with the IMF recommendation for Gulf States, to impose revenue-raising measures including excise and value-added taxes to help adjust to the low oil price environment that has slowed regional growth. The GCC countries have also agreed to implement selective taxes on tobacco, and soft and energy drinks this year.

The government of Oman has approached banks for an international bond issue with tranches of 5- and 10-years as the country plugs a budget deficit caused by lower oil prices. Oman's budget deficit is forecast to be USD 7.8bn in 2017, and the finance ministry has stated that it would cover this year's deficit with USD 5.5bn of international borrowing, USD 1bn of domestic borrowing and the drawdown of USD 1.3bn from financial reserves. Last year, the government raised a USD 1bn international syndicated loan in January, and issued tranches of 5- and 10-years international bonds worth USD 2.5bn in June, followed by another issue of USD 1.5bn in September.

<strong>Oil Market Review</strong>
Brent crude fell by 2 per cent to close the month at USD 55.7 per barrel, having maintained the price level at above USD 50 per barrel for all of January. OPEC nations Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria cut production in January more than they had originally committed to, while Russia followed suit and trimmed production faster than was initially agreed. However, rising US rig count and output put a cap on any oil price growth, as the US President had vowed to increase production.

		<Title>[:en]Neutral outlook for GCC stock markets[:ar]التوقعات محايدة لأسواق أسهم دول مجلس التعاون الخليجي[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">

According to Kuwait Financial Centre “Markaz” report on GCC stock & debt market outlook 2017, Boursa Kuwait has started this year on an explosive note. The much followed price index gained 16% while the weighted index gained by 11% as compared to 1.4% for MSCI GCC index and a negative 2.7% for Saudi Arabia. This has been among one of the sharpest rallies for Kuwait main index in recent years as the index posted positive gains for the fourteenth consecutive day. The surge in index is also matched by surge in liquidity.

While in the short run, a quick run up in the market is difficult to explain, in the long run stock market rally can only be sustained if there is concomitant increase in earnings. In the absence of healthy earnings growth, such sudden rise in market valuation will only feed speculators and invite fringe traders who will cause more harm than good for retail investors. It is clear that Kuwait and other GCC markets badly need active participation and support of institutional investors (SWF’s, mutual funds, etc.) in order to avoid hyper speculation. Regulators should engage with such institutional investors more actively in order to broad base their participation and encourage investment companies that manage funds and portfolios for such institutional investors. They will not only professionalize the market but can bring the much-needed stability in market activity, which will ultimately reduce volatility of the market.

There is a need to better align the institutional money in the market, best represented by mutual funds and portfolios managed by CMA licensed non-banking financial institutions. It is clear that KIA has shown a stable commitment to support the KSE since 1990’s when it launched and backed the mutual fund industry and continue to back it since then in many ways including governance. In addition to KIA, the CMA licensed companies manage portfolios and funds that best incarnate the values of CMA best represented by transparent, well governed, and research driven investment, and exceptional  records in anti-money laundering (AML). Yet regulation, reaching the right balance between regulations and restoring market confidence through a spirit of partnership seems to be the missing variable, especially to those investment companies that managed to survive the crisis and grow. Such CMA licensed financial sector companies are the natural gates towards institutional investment to avoid any unwarranted euphoria or speculation.

At the beginning of 2016, we were positive on UAE while being neutral on Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar. UAE (especially Dubai) was the outperformer in GCC markets, which was in-line with our expectations. Saudi Arabia stock market also returned positive helped by the recovery in oil prices towards the end of the year. Kuwait and Qatar ended the year flat. The overall S&P GCC index returned 9.5% in 2016 with better performance coming in the second part of the year. Despite over 50% rise in oil prices, investors seemed to take a wait and watch position before investing in the stock markets. This could be on account of poor corporate earnings growth and lower capital expenditures by GCC governments.

<img title="Table: Expectations 2017" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GCC_Stock_Market_Outlook__Blog_fig1.jpg" alt="Table: Expectations 2017" />

<strong>Economy</strong>
Qatar is expected to have the highest non-oil GDP growth rate (5.2% for 2017) in the region on account of the spending on infrastructure projects. In the recent budget, USD 25 Bn or 47 percent of the budget is earmarked for the completion of projects related to FIFA 2022. As of November 2016, Kuwait has awarded close to $12 Bn worth of contracts. Close to 58% of the projects awarded has been from the non-oil sector.  Kuwait is in a favourable position when it comes to fiscal and current accounts. Overall we are Neutral on Kuwait, UAE & Qatar while Negative on the rest of the GCC on economic factors.

<strong>Earnings</strong>
Growth in the overall earnings for GCC countries is expected to be flat at 0.3% for 2017 as GCC governments cut down on budget and welfare spending. Economic heavyweights of the region – Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar saw their corporate earnings decline by 3.6%, 3.4% and 7.8% respectively while that of UAE remained flat during 2016. Oman’s earnings witnessed a turnaround in 2016 and grew by 5.5%. 2017 could perhaps be seen as a year of consolidation and GCC corporates adjusting themselves to the new normal.

<img title="Figure: Earnings and Growth in GCC region, 2005- 2017" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GCC_Stock_Market_Outlook__Blog_fig2.jpg" alt="Figure: Earnings and Growth in GCC region, 2005- 2017" />

<strong>Valuation</strong>
Stock market returns for the GCC region, in 2016, with the exception of the UAE were either flat or marginally negative. As a result of this, the stock valuation levels have drifted away from the fundamental values. For instance, Price-to-earnings multiple for Saudi Arabia currently stands at 17.5x followed by Kuwait at 17.1x, and, in comparison with other major GCC markets such as UAE (P/E 12.2x) and Qatar (P/E 13.5x) they are trading at a premium. As a result, we are negative on Saudi stock market from a valuation standpoint while we remain neutral on Kuwait, UAE and Qatar.  We are positive on Oman and Bahrain on account of higher dividend yields of 5% and 6% respectively.

<strong>Market Liquidity</strong>
GCC stock markets have had some of the lowest levels of turnover in 2016 clocking in a turnover ratio at 34% despite the emerging market status of Qatar and UAE. Even the recovery in oil price during the 2nd quarter failed to increase the interest of investors in the region. Poor earnings growth in many of the key sectors, especially banks, did not augur well for improving the liquidity in the stock markets. We are Neutral on Saudi & UAE while Negative on the rest from liquidity point of view.

<strong>Overall Ratings </strong>
<strong>Saudi Arabia – Neutral</strong>
Saudi Arabia is entering an interesting phase now. It is undertaking a number of reforms, which are aimed at reducing the fiscal burden and increasing the employment opportunities for its youngsters. These reforms could cause some slowdown in the economy as the citizens adjust themselves to a new normal. Insurance sector continues to grow in the country despite the slowdown and is expected to continue in 2017 while construction related companies could suffer as government increases scrutiny on projects. Consumption could take a hit as a result of reform measures, which is why we have given a neutral rating for Saudi Arabia.

<strong>UAE – Neutral</strong>
Dubai is looking to continue its spending on account of the Expo 2020 as most of the infrastructure projects enter the final phase of the building process by early 2018. Areas like tourism, finance, hospitality, trade should continue to grow in 2017. Abu Dhabi, on the other hand, has been prudent even during boom times and has comfortable reserves to tide through 2017. Despite this, the global market for oil is expected to remain subdued. Real estate, one of the main drivers of UAE’s growth could take a hit in 2017 as sales are stagnating. As a result, we expect UAE to be neutral in 2017.

<strong>Qatar – Negative </strong>
Qatar is an interesting case. On the one hand, the government is spending on account of the 2022 FIFA world cup and targets a budget breakeven while on the other hand the financial sector of the country has suffered the most owing to government drawdowns. Telecom sector has been performing well in Qatar and is expected to continue it in 2017. Banking could take a hit as lower deposits could hamper credit growth. Valuations have not gone down in line with fundamentals, which is why we are negative on the Qatari market.

<strong>Kuwait - Neutral</strong>
Kuwait has seen lot of positive signals going for it during 2017. Its project awards market is witnessing a turnaround as a number of projects were awarded in 2016. The project awards trajectory has been quite positive. Banks in the region are better placed compared to its GCC peers and are likely to perform well in 2017 while real estate could suffer negatively owing to stagnant sales, price declines and negative sentiment.  The market is fairly attractive and there are some capital market reforms that are on cards that is expected to augur well for the market.

<strong>GCC Debt Market Outlook 2017</strong>
The prolonged period of low oil prices has put a strain on government budgets across the region, exposing the dependence that GCC economies have on oil revenues. Saudi Arabia, Oman and Bahrain have all scrambled to raise funds through bond issuances to compensate for the fall in oil revenues. Their sovereign rating was also downgraded in 2016 on back of widening fiscal balance and sluggish economic growth. However, Saudi Arabia with its “A1” rating remains in the investment grade while Oman (BBB-) and Bahrain (BB – Junk) have lower ratings. The ratings downgrade has had a visible impact on the pricing of the bonds. KSA had to pay 185bps over the 10 yr US treasury bond while Oman had to pay 320bps over the 10 yr treasury bond. GCC governments should carefully consider their borrowing and investment decisions while maintaining significant liquidity buffers for protecting themselves against short-term funding risk. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and UAE have significant headroom for borrowing as they have very little public debt outstanding. There is room for taking on more debt; however, it should be done only after careful considerations of the implications of building up debt and the impact of borrowing on domestic liquidity, credit, and central bank reserves. We expect GCC governments to cumulatively issue over USD 74 billion of debt in 2017.

According to Kuwait Financial Centre “Markaz” report on GCC stock & debt market outlook 2017, Boursa Kuwait has started this year on an explosive note. The much followed price index gained 16% while the weighted index gained by 11% as compared to 1.4% for MSCI GCC index and a negative 2.7% for Saudi Arabia. This has been among one of the sharpest rallies for Kuwait main index in recent years as the index posted positive gains for the fourteenth consecutive day. The surge in index is also matched by surge in liquidity.

While in the short run, a quick run up in the market is difficult to explain, in the long run stock market rally can only be sustained if there is concomitant increase in earnings. In the absence of healthy earnings growth, such sudden rise in market valuation will only feed speculators and invite fringe traders who will cause more harm than good for retail investors. It is clear that Kuwait and other GCC markets badly need active participation and support of institutional investors (SWF’s, mutual funds, etc.) in order to avoid hyper speculation. Regulators should engage with such institutional investors more actively in order to broad base their participation and encourage investment companies that manage funds and portfolios for such institutional investors. They will not only professionalize the market but can bring the much-needed stability in market activity, which will ultimately reduce volatility of the market.

There is a need to better align the institutional money in the market, best represented by mutual funds and portfolios managed by CMA licensed non-banking financial institutions. It is clear that KIA has shown a stable commitment to support the KSE since 1990’s when it launched and backed the mutual fund industry and continue to back it since then in many ways including governance. In addition to KIA, the CMA licensed companies manage portfolios and funds that best incarnate the values of CMA best represented by transparent, well governed, and research driven investment, and exceptional  records in anti-money laundering (AML). Yet regulation, reaching the right balance between regulations and restoring market confidence through a spirit of partnership seems to be the missing variable, especially to those investment companies that managed to survive the crisis and grow. Such CMA licensed financial sector companies are the natural gates towards institutional investment to avoid any unwarranted euphoria or speculation.

At the beginning of 2016, we were positive on UAE while being neutral on Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar. UAE (especially Dubai) was the outperformer in GCC markets, which was in-line with our expectations. Saudi Arabia stock market also returned positive helped by the recovery in oil prices towards the end of the year. Kuwait and Qatar ended the year flat. The overall S&P GCC index returned 9.5% in 2016 with better performance coming in the second part of the year. Despite over 50% rise in oil prices, investors seemed to take a wait and watch position before investing in the stock markets. This could be on account of poor corporate earnings growth and lower capital expenditures by GCC governments.

<img title="Table: Expectations 2017" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GCC_Stock_Market_Outlook__Blog_fig1.jpg" alt="Table: Expectations 2017" />

<strong>Economy</strong>
Qatar is expected to have the highest non-oil GDP growth rate (5.2% for 2017) in the region on account of the spending on infrastructure projects. In the recent budget, USD 25 Bn or 47 percent of the budget is earmarked for the completion of projects related to FIFA 2022. As of November 2016, Kuwait has awarded close to $12 Bn worth of contracts. Close to 58% of the projects awarded has been from the non-oil sector.  Kuwait is in a favourable position when it comes to fiscal and current accounts. Overall we are Neutral on Kuwait, UAE & Qatar while Negative on the rest of the GCC on economic factors.

<strong>Earnings</strong>
Growth in the overall earnings for GCC countries is expected to be flat at 0.3% for 2017 as GCC governments cut down on budget and welfare spending. Economic heavyweights of the region – Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar saw their corporate earnings decline by 3.6%, 3.4% and 7.8% respectively while that of UAE remained flat during 2016. Oman’s earnings witnessed a turnaround in 2016 and grew by 5.5%. 2017 could perhaps be seen as a year of consolidation and GCC corporates adjusting themselves to the new normal.

<img title="Figure: Earnings and Growth in GCC region, 2005- 2017" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GCC_Stock_Market_Outlook__Blog_fig2.jpg" alt="Figure: Earnings and Growth in GCC region, 2005- 2017" />

<strong>Valuation</strong>
Stock market returns for the GCC region, in 2016, with the exception of the UAE were either flat or marginally negative. As a result of this, the stock valuation levels have drifted away from the fundamental values. For instance, Price-to-earnings multiple for Saudi Arabia currently stands at 17.5x followed by Kuwait at 17.1x, and, in comparison with other major GCC markets such as UAE (P/E 12.2x) and Qatar (P/E 13.5x) they are trading at a premium. As a result, we are negative on Saudi stock market from a valuation standpoint while we remain neutral on Kuwait, UAE and Qatar.  We are positive on Oman and Bahrain on account of higher dividend yields of 5% and 6% respectively.

<strong>Market Liquidity</strong>
GCC stock markets have had some of the lowest levels of turnover in 2016 clocking in a turnover ratio at 34% despite the emerging market status of Qatar and UAE. Even the recovery in oil price during the 2nd quarter failed to increase the interest of investors in the region. Poor earnings growth in many of the key sectors, especially banks, did not augur well for improving the liquidity in the stock markets. We are Neutral on Saudi & UAE while Negative on the rest from liquidity point of view.

<strong>Overall Ratings </strong>
<strong>Saudi Arabia – Neutral</strong>
Saudi Arabia is entering an interesting phase now. It is undertaking a number of reforms, which are aimed at reducing the fiscal burden and increasing the employment opportunities for its youngsters. These reforms could cause some slowdown in the economy as the citizens adjust themselves to a new normal. Insurance sector continues to grow in the country despite the slowdown and is expected to continue in 2017 while construction related companies could suffer as government increases scrutiny on projects. Consumption could take a hit as a result of reform measures, which is why we have given a neutral rating for Saudi Arabia.

<strong>UAE – Neutral</strong>
Dubai is looking to continue its spending on account of the Expo 2020 as most of the infrastructure projects enter the final phase of the building process by early 2018. Areas like tourism, finance, hospitality, trade should continue to grow in 2017. Abu Dhabi, on the other hand, has been prudent even during boom times and has comfortable reserves to tide through 2017. Despite this, the global market for oil is expected to remain subdued. Real estate, one of the main drivers of UAE’s growth could take a hit in 2017 as sales are stagnating. As a result, we expect UAE to be neutral in 2017.

<strong>Qatar – Negative </strong>
Qatar is an interesting case. On the one hand, the government is spending on account of the 2022 FIFA world cup and targets a budget breakeven while on the other hand the financial sector of the country has suffered the most owing to government drawdowns. Telecom sector has been performing well in Qatar and is expected to continue it in 2017. Banking could take a hit as lower deposits could hamper credit growth. Valuations have not gone down in line with fundamentals, which is why we are negative on the Qatari market.

<strong>Kuwait - Neutral</strong>
Kuwait has seen lot of positive signals going for it during 2017. Its project awards market is witnessing a turnaround as a number of projects were awarded in 2016. The project awards trajectory has been quite positive. Banks in the region are better placed compared to its GCC peers and are likely to perform well in 2017 while real estate could suffer negatively owing to stagnant sales, price declines and negative sentiment.  The market is fairly attractive and there are some capital market reforms that are on cards that is expected to augur well for the market.

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">
According to Marmore’s recently released Monthly Market Review, MENA bourses had a positive month in December, with all markets ending the year in green. Morocco’s Casablanca Index led the charge rising 9.1 per cent, followed by Egypt’s HRMS index (7.2 per cent). Kuwait weighted and price indices had a positive month, with both climbing 3.5 per cent, amid a spurt in speculative trading ahead of the year-end. The Egyptian Index also registered the highest gains in the year, closing nearly 73 per cent higher from the year before. It was followed by Morocco (30.5 per cent) and Dubai (12.1 per cent). Only the Jordan (-3.8 per cent) and Kuwait Weighted index (-0.4 per cent) witnessed a fall in 2016. Among other GCC markets, Qatar was the best performer in December, rising 6.6 per cent, followed by Abu Dhabi (5.5 per cent), Oman (5.4 per cent) and Dubai (5.1 per cent). The OPEC decision to cut oil production by 1.2 million barrels a day from 33.6 million barrels, were deeper than many analysts had expected, and is expected to shrink the supply glut that has been fed in part by the US shale boom, and has depressed oil prices for more than two years. This, along with commitment from non-OPEC members, such as Russia, to cut production levels has improved investor sentiment, and has led to market recovery in the closing months of the year.

<div style="text-align: justify;">

Egypt index was buoyed by the government’s recent decisions, notably the liberalization of the Egyptian pound exchange rate to foreign currencies. Market capitalization of listed companies witnessed a 42 percent leap exceeding USD 33.1billion, the highest in 8 years since the global financial crisis in 2008. Market turnovers posted during the year was the highest in seven years, as the traded values rose over 55 per cent higher over 2015.

MENA markets liquidity continued its downward momentum in December, with volumes decreasing by 20 per cent and value traded by 4.8 per cent. All MENA markets, barring Saudi Arabia, witnessed fall in market liquidity in December, with Abu Dhabi and Egypt leading the charge. Overall MENA liquidity for the year was down 34 per cent compared to previous year’s turnover of USD 551bn. In terms of valuation, P/E of Morocco (19.8x), Kuwait (15.8x), and Qatar (14.8x) markets were the premium markets in the MENA region, while the markets of Egypt (8.0x), Dubai (9.2x), and Bahrain (9.7x) were the discount markets.

Blue Chips also had a positive month, with Saudi Electric and DP World (UAE) ending the month at the top of the pile, gaining 16.7 per cent and 12.7 per cent, respectively. SABIC (KSA) lagged behind the rest of the blue chips, falling by 3.4 per cent. Saudi Electric was also the best performing stock in 2016, rising over 42 per cent, and was followed by Ooredoo (Qatar, 36 per cent) and Industries Qatar (30 per cent). The Saudi Electricity Company announced the launch of 16 innovative projects to start 2017 that aim to enhance power efficiency in the Kingdom.

<strong>Saudi 2017 Budget</strong>
As part of its long-term plan to end its economy’s dependence on oil, Saudi Arabia unveiled its budget for 2017. Saudi Arabia plans to increase spending in 2017 to stimulate economic growth after austerity measures helped shrink its budget deficit, as the kingdom continues to by boost private sector activity. Deficit for 2016 has shrunk to USD 79.2bn, lower than what the government and most analysts had predicted, down 33 per cent from a record USD 97.6bn the previous year. It expects to run a deficit of USD 53bn in 2017, about 7.7 per cent of 2017 GDP estimates, and hopes to balance its finances by 2020.

The government plans to spend USD 237bn in 2017, an 8 per cent increase from 2016The Kingdom is expected to spend USD 71.4bn on National Transformation Plan through 2020; of which USD 11.2bn is allocated in 2017. Oil-income contributed to 62.3 per cent of government revenues in 2016, down from 73 per cent in 2015. Non-oil revenues are expected to total USD 53bn in 2016, still far from the target the government set in June of USD 141bn by 2020. The 2017 deficit will continue to be financed by issuing debt and drawing from reserves.

<strong>Oil Market Review</strong>
Brent crude rose 12.6 per cent to close the year 2016 at USD 56.28 per barrel, having nearly doubled since the low witnessed in January 2016. Prices shot up due to the expectation that production cut from major oil producers will curb oversupply in the market. OPEC and non-OPEC producers agreed to reduce crude oil production by 1.8 million bpd for six months from January 2017.

		<Title>[:en]Paris Climate Accord - Which side will the GCC pick?[:ar]اتفاق باريس للمناخ- أي جانب ستختار دول مجلس التعاون؟[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">
<div style="text-align: left;">

The Paris Accord, hailed as one of the biggest environmental treaties ever negotiated has now hit a roadblock as the U.S has stated its intention to withdraw from the agreement. In terms of size, the agreement supersedes the Kyoto protocol of 1997 signed by 41 nations that set emission targets for the participating nations. Despite countries meeting the expected target, it failed to make the desired impact as China and U.S, the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases were not bound by the agreement. Now with the introduction of the Paris Climate Accord, we analyze what it means for the GCC region and their stance on the deal in the aftermath of U.S pullout.

<strong>What is the Paris Climate Accord?</strong>
The Paris Agreement is a historic breakthrough for world nations with all countries penning down their compliance to the agreement in a bid to combat climate change, which remains as one of the key global issues. Signatory nations are required to take steps to ensure that the Earth’s temperature doesn’t rise above 2 degree Celsius. The highlight of the deal is that it gives freedom for the ratifying countries to independently decide on their emission targets and the course they wish to take to achieve them. This is in contrast to previous attempts that had common denominator judge individual nations without considering the economic, geographic and cultural differences between them.

The deal primarily hinges on voluntary commitments from signatory countries to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and aims to bestow economic incentives for developing nations in order to invest in cleaner technology as cost could be a key barrier for them in migrating from conventional sources of energy that are already in place. Despite being a landmark deal in many ways, it fell short in certain areas like having mandatory emission cuts for individual countries and did not enforce any mandatory donations from participating countries to the fund. But the shortcomings were expected as it took several years to shape up a deal that was palatable enough to be agreed upon by all countries worldwide.

<strong>Why did U.S pull out?</strong>
One of the notable talking points apart from the deal itself was U.S pullout from the agreement under the Trump administration. The U.S, which houses 4.3% of the world’s population, is responsible for about 15.5% of the world’s total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and the decision to back-out from the agreement has drawn criticism from within and outside the country. Despite the criticism on several fronts, U.S justification towards the move was based on economic reasons as compliance to the agreement would have a direct impact on their manufacturing and fossil fuel industries. It was also stated by the U.S President that the agreement would cost America a sum of USD 3 trillion and deprive Americans of 6.5 million jobs in the industrial and manufacturing sector. This came amidst the support from several U.S and international oil companies such as Royal Dutch Shell, ExxonMobil and BP towards the Paris agreement stating that climate change would be a threat to their business.

<strong>Combating climate change in the GCC – Are they on course?</strong>
Due to heavy reliance of GCC economies on hydrocarbon revenues, combating climate change and pollution have remained a persistent challenge. Oil drilling, infrastructure development and rapid urbanization have been the primary causes for air pollution in the region. Qatar ranks 1<sup>st</sup> in the world in terms of CO<sub>2</sub> emission per capita and contributes to 0.25% of the world’s total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions while housing only 0.031% of the world’s population. Domestic energy consumption has also been higher in the GCC countries compared to others with Bahrain consuming more than 20,000 KWh of electricity per capita in 2015. Such high levels of consumption puts pressure on energy generation which in turn has negative effects on the environment.

However, GCC countries are being increasingly aware about the situation at hand and have taken measures to comply with global emission standards. They have incorporated climate change as a key focus area in their future vision plans and have set short and long term renewable energy targets. The move to diversify the source of revenue away from Oil due to the drop in prices is also expected to have environmental benefits as it would mean that emissions could be greatly reduced. Compared to 2014, all GCC countries have improved in terms of diversification of revenues with Qatar having the least share of hydrocarbon revenues as part of total revenues in 2017.

The UAE has been taking substantial steps in addressing the issue of climate change. In 2016, it expanded the role of its environment ministry to encompass climate change and renamed it to the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment thereby signaling it’s commitment towards the cause. As per the UAE Energy Strategy 2050, the UAE targets to 27% of its total energy through clean sources by 2021 and 50% by 2050. With ambitious projects such as the 1,177MW Noor Abu Dhabi Solar Plant and the 5,000MW Mohammad Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park taking shape, UAE’s position towards climate change looks evident. Saudi Arabia as part of its Saudi Vision 2030 has been implementing measures to protect the environment which also aligns with its agenda of economic diversification. By 2040, Saudi Arabia has targeted to achieve 30% share of renewables as part of its total energy mix. Other GCC countries have also stepped foot on a similar path to achieve economic diversification in an environmentally sustainable manner.

<strong>Which side will GCC lean towards?</strong>
All GCC countries have penned down their compliance to the Paris Agreement and submitted their Intended Determined Contributions (INDCs) which outline their mitigation strategies to tackle climate change. However, it is to be seen how things would fare amidst the ongoing diplomatic crisis.

Remaining a part of the Paris Agreement also has economic benefits for GCC countries in addition to the inherent environmental benefits. Putting constraints on the usage of fossil fuels helps in cutting down the supply thereby triggering an increase in price. Due to the exit of U.S, EU-China is expected to take lead in the quest for climate change mitigation. So co-operation with EU-China, who are among the main trade partners of GCC countries, is expected to help them in future relations. Considering all above factors, there is more to gain from the Paris Agreement for GCC countries and it is expected to sway them towards compliance to the deal for the greater good.

Oil drilling, infrastructure development and rapid urbanization have been the primary causes for air pollution in the region. Qatar ranks 1<sup>st</sup> in the world in terms of CO<sub>2</sub> emission per capita and contributes to 0.25% of the world’s total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions while housing only 0.031% of the world’s population. Domestic energy consumption has also been higher in the GCC countries compared to others with Bahrain consuming more than 20,000 KWh of electricity per capita in 2015. Such high levels of consumption puts pressure on energy generation which in turn has negative effects on the environment.

However, GCC countries are being increasingly aware about the situation at hand and have taken measures to comply with global emission standards. They have incorporated climate change as a key focus area in their future vision plans and have set short and long term renewable energy targets. The move to diversify the source of revenue away from Oil due to the drop in prices is also expected to have environmental benefits as it would mean that emissions could be greatly reduced. Compared to 2014, all GCC countries have improved in terms of diversification of revenues with Qatar having the least share of hydrocarbon revenues as part of total revenues in 2017.

The UAE has been taking substantial steps in addressing the issue of climate change. In 2016, it expanded the role of its environment ministry to encompass climate change and renamed it to the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment thereby signaling it’s commitment towards the cause. As per the UAE Energy Strategy 2050, the UAE targets to 27% of its total energy through clean sources by 2021 and 50% by 2050. With ambitious projects such as the 1,177MW Noor Abu Dhabi Solar Plant and the 5,000MW Mohammad Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park taking shape, UAE’s position towards climate change looks evident. Saudi Arabia as part of its Saudi Vision 2030 has been implementing measures to protect the environment which also aligns with its agenda of economic diversification. By 2040, Saudi Arabia has targeted to achieve 30% share of renewables as part of its total energy mix. Other GCC countries have also stepped foot on a similar path to achieve economic diversification in an environmentally sustainable manner.

<strong>Which side will GCC lean towards?</strong>
All GCC countries have penned down their compliance to the Paris Agreement and submitted their Intended Determined Contributions (INDCs) which outline their mitigation strategies to tackle climate change. However, it is to be seen how things would fare amidst the ongoing diplomatic crisis.

Remaining a part of the Paris Agreement also has economic benefits for GCC countries in addition to the inherent environmental benefits. Putting constraints on the usage of fossil fuels helps in cutting down the supply thereby triggering an increase in price. Due to the exit of U.S, EU-China is expected to take lead in the quest for climate change mitigation. So co-operation with EU-China, who are among the main trade partners of GCC countries, is expected to help them in future relations. Considering all above factors, there is more to gain from the Paris Agreement for GCC countries and it is expected to sway them towards compliance to the deal for the greater good.

<strong>UAE – Start-up hub of the GCC</strong>
UAE has been the prime destination for budding start-ups in the Arab region offering a plethora of opportunities for prospective business owners. It is one of the most diversified economies in the GCC and home to some of the most highly valued start-ups in the region like Careem and Fetchr. Prime reasons to it are the measures taken by the government to improve the regulatory and policy frame work to encourage SMEs.

Currently, there are over 350,000 SMEs in the country which contribute to 40% of the GDP while employing 72% of the total working population (Bloovo). The proactive steps taken by the policymakers have helped UAE attain the 26<sup>th</sup> rank in the ‘Ease of doing business index’ for 2017 according to the World Bank and 35<sup>th</sup> rank in the Global Innovation Index. Also the presence of several startup accelerators and incubators in the country have helped entrepreneurs build on their ideas and get the support necessary to make their business a reality.

<strong>GCC start-ups – rising global investments</strong>
Investments in MENA start-ups have been seeing an uptrend over the past few years. Funding activity in the first nine months of 2017 (169 deals) have already surpassed the levels seen in the whole of 2016 (164 deals) (<a href="http://www.magnitt.com/">MAGNiTT</a> Q317 MENA funding report card). Excluding Souq and Careem, start-up funding in the MENA region for YTD 2017 is at USD 254mn and on course to surpass the 282mn raised in the previous year.

The global outreach of GCC startups have also been on the rise, drawing attention from investors worldwide. When profiling the investors of top GCC 10 start-ups from the Forbes list, it is observed that more than half of them are based outside the base country with the majority being Venture Capitals.

The trend is seen in exits as well with companies based outside the MENA region showing interest to acquire GCC start-ups. Some of the major acquisitions in the past few years include Media.net by China’s Miteno (USD 900mn), Souq by global e-commerce giant Amazon (USD 680mn) and Talabat by US based Rocket Internet (USD 170mn).

<strong>Fetchr – The next unicorn start-up from GCC?</strong>
Fetchr is one of many emerging start-ups in the region which show immense promise. It is a Dubai based startup founded in 2012, which uses a smartphone’s location tracking capabilities in order to make product deliveries. The lack of clear addresses and postal codes for many areas in the UAE have made traditional deliveries a tedious process. Therefore, by allowing users to geo-locate the pick-up and drop-off points, Fetchr has come up with an innovative solution to make things simpler for package deliveries. Speed and accuracy of deliveries have been improved with the help of their patented technology in a region where getting things delivered could be quite complicated.

The logistics start-up has had a stellar year in 2017 as it raised USD 41mn worth funding in May, adding to its existing funds which will allow them to venture into other areas across the MENA region in addition to UAE, Bahrain, Egypt and Saudi Arabia where they are currently present. Fetchr was one of the first companies in the region to be backed by a top tier Silicon Valley Venture Capital as it raised USD 11mn in its Series A funding round backed by New Enterprise associates based out of the US.

Providing innovative solutions and understanding the local business landscape have helped Fetchr grow leaps and bounds while there is still scope for scaling up. Learnings from Fetchr’s case is that businesses need to view the pain points of the customer as opportunities and come up with solutions that will make their lives simpler.

<strong>Can they make it big?</strong>
Although the business environment in the GCC is not the most conducive for start-ups at the moment, steps have been taken by policymakers to encourage the development of SMEs. Considering the need for GCC economies to move away from Oil, more such steps are expected from governments to aid the development of the start-up space. With the emergence of global investments, startup activity has considerably risen in the GCC and going by the trend witnessed in the last decade, GCC start-ups are on the right track and several unicorn start-ups can be expected from the region.

Saudi Arabia plans to pump about 9.77mbpd in November, which would be its lowest output since January 2015. According to the Saudi energy ministry, the decrease in allocations for November includes a full 290,000-bpd reduction over and above the 486,000 bpd that Saudi Arabia pledged to cut as part of its commitment.

<div style="text-align: justify;">

Considering Saudi Arabia’s commitment to do whatever it takes to end the oil glut, it is pertinent to understand how far Saudi Arabia can actually go to cut its output. Some of the prominent factors that would influence Saudi Arabia’s production cuts are its market share, global demand for oil and most importantly Aramco’s valuation.

<strong>Market Share</strong>
One bright spot for Saudi Arabia as an outcome of its initial decision of not cutting the production, is that it gained market share by 1% over the last two years. However, with the OPEC proposal to freeze or cut production, the gain receded to some extent. Saudi Arabia’s exports declined from 7.4 mbpd during October-2016 to 6.7 mbpd during September-2017.

Considering that Saudi Arabia’s supply is still in excess compared to that at the end of 2014, it appears there is still some room to cut output albeit at the cost of losing market share by a few more basis points.

<strong>Global Demand</strong>
The oil price woe started with the shrinking gap between demand and supply and eventually leading to the current scenario of excess supply. Consumption was affected due to slowdown in the phase of growth in demand for oil globally and in particular China- the second largest oil buyer. This led to increased gap between supply and demand.  The demand of crude is beyond the vicinity of control for the crude suppliers and hence they can only rely on the supply to influence the price. Excess supply at a lower price is not likely to result in increased consumption, though the oil importers might use this opportunity to stockpile crude. However, considering the long-term storage costs, the increase in the level of consumption is going to be limited unless real demand kicks in.

<strong>Table: Global Demand and Supply (mbpd)</strong>

Saudi which relies heavily on the oil revenue, is better off with higher oil price. Despite increased production levels, Saudi will not be able to push the required additional barrels of oil to compensate for the loss of revenue due to the lower oil price. For instance, Saudi would have to increase the exports volume by 1.5X @ USD 65 per barrel and 2X @ USD 50 per barrel to match export revenue of oil price @ USD 100 per barrel. Now that the gap between supply and demand appears to be diminishing, Saudi would it’s supply cut to further reduce this gap. However, Saudi will also ensure through its dominance in OPEC that all the members to contribute to plug this gap.

<strong>Aramco Valuation</strong>
The significance of oil prices on the Aramco IPO cannot be emphasized enough. Higher price of oil would help the Aramco report stronger realized sales in the financial performance details that it must release ahead of the IPO. According to Sanford C. Bernstein estimates, Aramco would make a net profit of USD 13.3 a barrel on its upstream production with oil @ USD 50, on the contrary its profit would increase to USD 16.90 with oil @ USD 60. This suggested that a USD 10 swing in the oil price could effectively translate into hundreds of millions of dollars to Aramco’s IPO valuation. Considering the coveted USD 2 trillion valuation of Aramco that the Saudi Government is aiming towards, marginal receding of market share is relatively a smaller sacrifice.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>
The Saudi Arabia-led OPEC initiative to control the oil prices have started to yield result with the global oil market improving and stabilizing. The oil price has recovered considerably and global oversupply has nearly halved since the beginning of the year. Saudi Arabia would aim to keep the oil prices around USD 60 per barrel by cutting production, for now as this would help Saudi Arabia maneuver its economy comfortably and at the same time not offer much incentive to US shale producers to increase output drastically.
For Saudi Arabia it may appear that oil price recovery has come at a cost of giving up market share. However, it has two very strong reasons – reducing budget deficit and highest possible valuation for the Aramco, to stick to the cuts. Considering these priorities, historic production and market share levels of Saudi Arabia and global oil demand in the near future, it can be argued that Saudi Arabia production levels haven’t reach the maximum floor levels. We believe that Saudi Arabia wouldn’t hesitate to cut its production by another half a million barrels to achieve its target price.

		<Title><![CDATA[[:en]Saudi Aramco’s India Investment – To where is the oil flowing to?[:ar]استثمارات "أرامكو السعودية" في الهند.. إلى أين يتدفّق النفط؟[:]]]></Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: left;">Saudi Aramco is arguably one of the world’s largest Oil and Gas Company in terms of revenues and reserves that they control. To give an idea of its size, Aramco produces close to 10.3Mn barrels per day and its closest rival, the Russian state-owned Rosneft produces a third of that. Given their relative dominance in this space, it is surprising that only recently Saudi Aramco has opened its office in India and plans to invest in India’s downstream opportunities including refining, pipeline, marketing, and technology know-how. To put things into perspective, Saudi Arabia has been a key supplier of crude to India over the years. As of 2016, imports of crude oil from Saudi Arabia accounted 20% of the total crude imports in India followed by Iraq at 16% and Iran at 11%. Even the strong economic growth witnessed in India during the pre-2007 era was not enough to entice Aramco to open an office in India. Only in 2016 did it establish a skeletal presence in the country which is now being expanded.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">South East Asian countries including the likes of India and China have hitherto been most lucrative markets for Middle East countries owing to their size and their geographical proximity. Together, these countries account for four of every 10 people in the world, combined making them one of the largest consumers of oil and natural gas. India’s oil demand, especially, is forecast to grow from 135,000 barrels a day in 2017 and 275,000 barrels a day in 2018, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). IEA also estimates that India’s refining capacity would lag behind the demand making the country a priority for companies such as Aramco that is trying to expand its global reach and diversify its assets.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>New suppliers rock the Asian boat</strong>
Asian buyers, owing to their higher dependence on crude from Middle East on an average pay more than their Western counterparts. An issue that has largely been under the radar except for occasional requests from Asian government and limited studies undertaken by some governments that put the Asian oil  premium at $1-$1.5 higher than their Western counterparts. In light of this, the emergence of new shale supplies from across the Atlantic has put “Asian Premium” issue in the limelight. In March 2017, India’s oil minister had asked OPEC to look at rationalizing the oil pricing for Asian buyers since they are the major consumers now, also a sign that is reflective of OPEC’s declining clout in fixing oil prices.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">India was one of the latest nations to make a purchase from US after China and Japan. India’s first purchase of oil from the US has been on ex-ship basis (Delivered ex ship (DES) is a trade term requiring the seller to deliver goods to a buyer at an agreed) making their prices very competitive vis-à-vis Middle East. Trade data from Bloomberg shows that, there are 11 full-laden tankers that is expected to arrive Asia during November 2017 with more expected to tank up late October and early November (<a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/usa-asia-oil/asia-oil-buyers-turn-to-u-s-in-hunt-for-cheap-supply-idINKBN1CL1BB">Reuters</a>). This coupled with the increasing price differential for Middle Eastern oil have prompted India and other countries in the region to diversify their supply sources and look at the US as an alternative supplier. US exporters have happily obliged to such increased demand, it’s per day exports reached 1.98Mn barrels by late September and is expected to reach 2.2 Mn barrels in the coming weeks.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Two large –scale investments in Indonesia, Malaysia and potentially another one in India may probably point to Aramco’s efforts at mitigating these price concerns among key clients in key markets and to ensure that future commercial deals are not unduly endangered owing to the price premium.  Besides, these investments also open up opportunities for signing long-term oil supply contracts increasing the revenue visibility.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Aramco’s larger play</strong>
Saudi Aramco already has downstream operations in South Korea (majority equity interest in S-oil), the US (through takeover of erstwhile Motiva), Netherlands (joint venture with German LANXESS) and in China (Fujian Refining and Petrochemical Company).

Saudi Aramco is arguably one of the world’s largest Oil and Gas Company in terms of revenues and reserves that they control. To give an idea of its size, Aramco produces close to 10.3Mn barrels per day and its closest rival, the Russian state-owned Rosneft produces a third of that. Given their relative dominance in this space, it is surprising that only recently Saudi Aramco has opened its office in India and plans to invest in India’s downstream opportunities including refining, pipeline, marketing, and technology know-how. To put things into perspective, Saudi Arabia has been a key supplier of crude to India over the years. As of 2016, imports of crude oil from Saudi Arabia accounted 20% of the total crude imports in India followed by Iraq at 16% and Iran at 11%. Even the strong economic growth witnessed in India during the pre-2007 era was not enough to entice Aramco to open an office in India. Only in 2016 did it establish a skeletal presence in the country which is now being expanded.

South East Asian countries including the likes of India and China have hitherto been most lucrative markets for Middle East countries owing to their size and their geographical proximity. Together, these countries account for four of every 10 people in the world, combined making them one of the largest consumers of oil and natural gas. India’s oil demand, especially, is forecast to grow from 135,000 barrels a day in 2017 and 275,000 barrels a day in 2018, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). IEA also estimates that India’s refining capacity would lag behind the demand making the country a priority for companies such as Aramco that is trying to expand its global reach and diversify its assets.

<strong>New suppliers rock the Asian boat</strong>
Asian buyers, owing to their higher dependence on crude from Middle East on an average pay more than their Western counterparts. An issue that has largely been under the radar except for occasional requests from Asian government and limited studies undertaken by some governments that put the Asian oil  premium at $1-$1.5 higher than their Western counterparts. In light of this, the emergence of new shale supplies from across the Atlantic has put “Asian Premium” issue in the limelight. In March 2017, India’s oil minister had asked OPEC to look at rationalizing the oil pricing for Asian buyers since they are the major consumers now, also a sign that is reflective of OPEC’s declining clout in fixing oil prices.

India was one of the latest nations to make a purchase from US after China and Japan. India’s first purchase of oil from the US has been on ex-ship basis (Delivered ex ship (DES) is a trade term requiring the seller to deliver goods to a buyer at an agreed) making their prices very competitive vis-à-vis Middle East. Trade data from Bloomberg shows that, there are 11 full-laden tankers that is expected to arrive Asia during November 2017 with more expected to tank up late October and early November (<a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/usa-asia-oil/asia-oil-buyers-turn-to-u-s-in-hunt-for-cheap-supply-idINKBN1CL1BB">Reuters</a>). This coupled with the increasing price differential for Middle Eastern oil have prompted India and other countries in the region to diversify their supply sources and look at the US as an alternative supplier. US exporters have happily obliged to such increased demand, it’s per day exports reached 1.98Mn barrels by late September and is expected to reach 2.2 Mn barrels in the coming weeks.

Two large –scale investments in Indonesia, Malaysia and potentially another one in India may probably point to Aramco’s efforts at mitigating these price concerns among key clients in key markets and to ensure that future commercial deals are not unduly endangered owing to the price premium.  Besides, these investments also open up opportunities for signing long-term oil supply contracts increasing the revenue visibility.

<strong>Aramco’s larger play</strong>
Saudi Aramco already has downstream operations in South Korea (majority equity interest in S-oil), the US (through takeover of erstwhile Motiva), Netherlands (joint venture with German LANXESS) and in China (Fujian Refining and Petrochemical Company). Aramco’s signing agreements with Malaysia and Indonesia will add two more locations to its downstream operations. During market downturns, such as the one taking place in the oil market now, upstream earnings suffer significantly more than downstream businesses do. Integrated companies on an average exhibit less earning volatility and high value addition through specialized product developments resulting in higher margins. Aramco’s talks with top India refiners for a stake in a refinery located on the West coast with an annual capacity of 60Mn tonnes fits very well into its downstream play.

Aramco also stated that its goal is to increase its global refining capacity to 8m-10m b/d and it has been scouting for investment opportunities across the globe.

If the deal takes shape it would help Aramco to cement its position as an important player in the Indian market despite it being a late entrant to India.

<strong>Dependency on imports in GCC </strong>
Food security is a perennial issue for the GCC due to the scarcity of arable land and water forcing GCC to rely on import for around 80 percent of its food requirement (The National). Food consumption in the GCC stood at 39 million metric tons (MMT) in 2014 and is expected to rise at a CAGR of 4.5 per cent until 2019 (Wealth Monitor) due to growing population and increase in tourists. These factors will continue to drive the demand for imports in the future. High dependency on imports put forward crucial challenges like fluctuation in global food price and geopolitical rifts for GCC nations to tackle.

<strong>Exposure to Volatility in Food Price  </strong>
Risk to global food price fluctuation was already showcased in 2008 when a global food shortage forced many countries to halt exports due to domestic constraints, causing the price of staples to surge almost 59 per cent (Gulf Business) in the region. Government in GCC have previously insulated the consumer from global food price volatility by providing subsidies and fixed price for certain products as the Gulf nations had huge fiscal buffers from oil revenue. But in the current scenario where nation states are facing fiscal deficit due to oil price crisis, it is no longer a viable solution.

<strong>Frequent Geopolitical Rifts in the region </strong>
The greatest threat to food-importing countries in the region comes from reliance on global trade chokepoints; maritime straits, ports and inland transport networks critical to the global grain trade (Chatham House).  80% of total wheat imports to GCC comes through Suez Canal while same amount of rice is imported through Strait of Hormuz. Over a third of grain imports to the MENA region pass through at least one maritime chokepoint for which there is no alternative route.

The governments have long assumed that agricultural production can be outsourced and domestic demand can be met through investment and acquisitions in neighboring countries. However, the Gulf crisis has shed the light on the reality of chokepoint exposure in the region where a geopolitical crisis can turn into a food security emergency. Qatar that imports roughly 40 percent (BBC) of its food overland through Saudi Arabia, and most of the rest via shipping routes that pass through the UAE ports to refuel revealed such vulnerability.

<strong>How can GCC attain sustainable food security?</strong>
<strong>Investments in Farmlands Abroad</strong>
GCC nations have previously explored various strategies to protect them from vulnerability to food imports. Investing in foreign farmland is one of the most convenient option. Most of the land investments from GCC are focused towards countries like Sudan, Egypt, Ethiopia, Morocco, Philippines and Indonesia. The UAE and Saudi Arabia are among the top investors in land abroad (Land Matrix).

Gulf countries investment in Ethiopia hit USD 3bn between 2010 and 2015. The Philippines hosts agriculture and farmland investments from all six members of the GCC. Saudi Arabia (imports more than 60% of its annual food supply) has entered into a joint venture with a Filipino company on about 5,000 ha of land. Bahrain, too, currently produces bananas on 1,000 ha of land in the Philippines, and Kuwaiti investors are looking at 400 ha for rice cultivation.

Indonesia hosts investors from the UAE and Qatar, Cambodia from Qatar and Kuwait, Vietnam from Qatar, and Laos from Kuwait. The Kuwaiti government is reported to have offered Cambodia loans totaling USD 546Mn for dams and roads in return for 50,000 ha of farmland, possibly on a 99-year lease, to grow crops. However, getting big projects off the ground in places that lack infrastructure is tricky while Gulf States who fund them have sometimes been accused of being neocolonial.

<strong>Expansion of Storage Capacity</strong>
Going forward, one of the most viable solution to safeguard supply from volatility in food prices and geopolitical risks would be to significantly boost the warehouse storage capacities. The costs of infrastructure development and storage in this region will be lesser than the cost of increasing domestic production. The government should aim at expanding their storage capacity to at least a year’s consumption to ensure a more sustainable management of resources that would contain these risk to an extent.

For example, Saudi Arabia Grains Organization (SAGO) owns and operates silo complexes in major cities around the Kingdom. The organization had total combined wheat storage capacity of 3.2 MMT (equivalent to approximately 10 months of consumption) at the end of 2016 and has signed contracts to build five additional silos that will increase the total storage capacity to 3.7 MMT by the end of 2017 (USDA).

In early 2016, a strategic grain storage terminal called “Etihad Mills” opened within the Fujairah Free Zone to help ensure food security within the UAE. It operates 20 silos and has a total storage capacity of roughly 2.7 TMT.

Recently in 2017, Qatar has also planned to build USD 440Mn strategic food security facilities and warehouses at Hamad Port having capacity of providing stockpile of processed and stored food for 3 million people for two years.

Along with expansion of food storage capacity, GCC government should also focus on simultaneously containing the social expenditures, diversify their economies and broaden their revenue base to lower their exposure from petroleum sector. Thus decent food security ranking may be psychologically satisfying, GCC countries have a challenging road ahead to transform the dream of sustainable food security into reality.

<strong>Exposure to Volatility in Food Price  </strong>
Risk to global food price fluctuation was already showcased in 2008 when a global food shortage forced many countries to halt exports due to domestic constraints, causing the price of staples to surge almost 59 per cent (Gulf Business) in the region. Government in GCC have previously insulated the consumer from global food price volatility by providing subsidies and fixed price for certain products as the Gulf nations had huge fiscal buffers from oil revenue. But in the current scenario where nation states are facing fiscal deficit due to oil price crisis, it is no longer a viable solution.

<strong>Frequent Geopolitical Rifts in the region </strong>
The greatest threat to food-importing countries in the region comes from reliance on global trade chokepoints; maritime straits, ports and inland transport networks critical to the global grain trade (Chatham House).  80% of total wheat imports to GCC comes through Suez Canal while same amount of rice is imported through Strait of Hormuz. Over a third of grain imports to the MENA region pass through at least one maritime chokepoint for which there is no alternative route.

The governments have long assumed that agricultural production can be outsourced and domestic demand can be met through investment and acquisitions in neighboring countries. However, the Gulf crisis has shed the light on the reality of chokepoint exposure in the region where a geopolitical crisis can turn into a food security emergency. Qatar that imports roughly 40 percent (BBC) of its food overland through Saudi Arabia, and most of the rest via shipping routes that pass through the UAE ports to refuel revealed such vulnerability.

<strong>How can GCC attain sustainable food security?</strong>
<strong>Investments in Farmlands Abroad</strong>
GCC nations have previously explored various strategies to protect them from vulnerability to food imports. Investing in foreign farmland is one of the most convenient option. Most of the land investments from GCC are focused towards countries like Sudan, Egypt, Ethiopia, Morocco, Philippines and Indonesia. The UAE and Saudi Arabia are among the top investors in land abroad (Land Matrix).

Gulf countries investment in Ethiopia hit USD 3bn between 2010 and 2015. The Philippines hosts agriculture and farmland investments from all six members of the GCC. Saudi Arabia (imports more than 60% of its annual food supply) has entered into a joint venture with a Filipino company on about 5,000 ha of land. Bahrain, too, currently produces bananas on 1,000 ha of land in the Philippines, and Kuwaiti investors are looking at 400 ha for rice cultivation.

Indonesia hosts investors from the UAE and Qatar, Cambodia from Qatar and Kuwait, Vietnam from Qatar, and Laos from Kuwait. The Kuwaiti government is reported to have offered Cambodia loans totaling USD 546Mn for dams and roads in return for 50,000 ha of farmland, possibly on a 99-year lease, to grow crops. However, getting big projects off the ground in places that lack infrastructure is tricky while Gulf States who fund them have sometimes been accused of being neocolonial.

<strong>Expansion of Storage Capacity</strong>
Going forward, one of the most viable solution to safeguard supply from volatility in food prices and geopolitical risks would be to significantly boost the warehouse storage capacities. The costs of infrastructure development and storage in this region will be lesser than the cost of increasing domestic production. The government should aim at expanding their storage capacity to at least a year’s consumption to ensure a more sustainable management of resources that would contain these risk to an extent.

For example, Saudi Arabia Grains Organization (SAGO) owns and operates silo complexes in major cities around the Kingdom. The organization had total combined wheat storage capacity of 3.2 MMT (equivalent to approximately 10 months of consumption) at the end of 2016 and has signed contracts to build five additional silos that will increase the total storage capacity to 3.7 MMT by the end of 2017 (USDA).

In early 2016, a strategic grain storage terminal called “Etihad Mills” opened within the Fujairah Free Zone to help ensure food security within the UAE. It operates 20 silos and has a total storage capacity of roughly 2.7 TMT.

Recently in 2017, Qatar has also planned to build USD 440Mn strategic food security facilities and warehouses at Hamad Port having capacity of providing stockpile of processed and stored food for 3 million people for two years.

Along with expansion of food storage capacity, GCC government should also focus on simultaneously containing the social expenditures, diversify their economies and broaden their revenue base to lower their exposure from petroleum sector. Thus decent food security ranking may be psychologically satisfying, GCC countries have a challenging road ahead to transform the dream of sustainable food security into reality.

The first round of production cuts was agreed in November 2016 and was effective during January 2017 and was aimed at cutting down 750,000 barrels of oil per day from the global supply. Second round of the production cuts announced in May 2017 is aimed to take out 1.8 Mn barrels per day which is aimed at balancing the market. While most of the countries have agreed to the cut, some of critics of the plan point out that the efficacy of the previous plan, saying that this planned cut in output cannot achieve in nine months what the plan could not achieve in the previous six months. OPEC’s influence seems to be waning with the rise of alternative supplies, it is no more able to influence prices through production cuts alone as shale producers are more than eager to fill the void and make any production cut exercise null and void. To counter this, we feel the OPEC should do two things.

<strong>Monitoring the output</strong>
Getting the non-OPEC countries to play along would be first and foremost challenge for the OPEC members. Drastic cuts in production might not be welcome by all of the participating nations; Non-OPEC countries that participated in the previous cut fell well short of their production targets while OPEC countries cut production by more than what they promised at 111% (During April and Mar 2017 it was at 111% during; During February and Jan 2017 they were 97% and 99% respectively). It’s the output from larger players that really count - Russia and Mexico, being the two largest producers outside of the OPEC region. While Mexico has exceeded its agreed commitment, Russia fell well short of its reduction commitment at 78%. However given their renewed commitment to extend the cut till March 2018 indicates that low oil prices is causing trouble there as well, Russia could very well nudge its companies to fall in line.

Another way to ensure compliance with the given targets is by making the oil production data more transparent. A weekly data of production submission among the OPEC and non-OPEC members would help in speedier correction and in ensuring better compliance with the agreed plan. There could be executive level meetings that could be held on a monthly or fortnightly basis in order to share production data and generally be aware of each other’s production activities.

<strong>Talking with the U.S shale players on co-operating and co-existing </strong>
Shale oil producers are here to stay and their rise as an alternative supplier in the market seems inevitable and even welcoming for countries like India, the third largest consumer of the commodity. India recently even announced that they are looking forward to have more supplies from new market such as the US. In such a scenario, this would be right time to open a dialogue with the shale producers. Information asymmetry across both these groups is leading to a zero-sum game, any loss of OPEC’s market share is a potential gain for Shale oil suppliers.

Shale firms need OPEC to achieve its objective of reducing global oil stockpiles and raising prices. And OPEC needs shale producers to be cautious in enormously growing output to avoid undermining its policy of supply restraint. Warming up to each other through frequent meetings and dialogues are the only way to ensure that both the opposing parties are working towards the fulfilment of a larger goal instead of their own self-interest. The U.S shale producers could also use some of the critical insights into OPEC method of thinking to better develop co-operation strategies. While a full-fledged co-operation might not be possible owing to the sheer number of companies and the legal penalties involved it could be a small start that possibly could set out a new path for oil.

OPEC could use this opportunity to revisit some of its strategies in oil pricing and might as well increase its cooperation with traders and hedge fund managers. Given the rise of alternative supplies from US and other unconventional source, OPEC’s influence on over oil supply and price might have waned but it still remains at the centre a new dawn for global co-operation on oil.

The GCC region too has caught-up with this global phenomenon and has some successful start-up stories to boast about. Start-ups are being projected as forerunners of economic growth through job creation and also pursued as the solution for job creation. However, to what extent this presumption about start-ups holds well is debatable.

Prior to answering the question-if start-ups can be key to the growing concern of unemployment in the region, the effectiveness of start-ups in job creation has to be assessed.  The Y-o-Y increase in jobs and establishment in the UAE across sectors most cases has resulted in incremental jobs. It is however obvious, that the growth in the jobs on the account of newer establishments coming into existence has be not been consistent within/across sectors.

For instance, the educational sector employment strength increased by 2,571 employees while 61 new establishments were set-up in 2013. Similar level of job creation was witnessed in 2015 in the financial sector but there were only 20 new establishment set-up.

Contrary to the trend in the financial sector discussed above, in the construction sector 1,086 new establishments were set-up in UAE in 2012, yet, the industry employment strength decreased by 28K. Similarly, the transportation sector witnessed a drop in number of establishments during the years 2012 and 2013, but this didn’t result it drop in the growth in employment, rather the sector employee strength increased by c.30K.

<strong>Start-ups a solution for job creation?</strong>
Looking at start-ups as a solution for job creation may not be a very wise stand. Based on the employment-established Y-o-Y growth/decline trend across sectors, it is evident that in most cases newer establishments have led to job creation. Though the newer establishments would have led to job creation, in some cases, they have failed to make an impact and the industry on the whole witnessed drop in employment.

The inherent high failure risk of start-ups could cause significant volatility in the job the market. The solution for the job creation should be more stable and consistent and not something which is unpredictable. Moreover, the early stage of start-ups would limit the employment generation, as they tend to run leaner operations to preserve cash and invest it in the business. The employee strength of the start-ups discussed in the table below establish the idiosyncratic nature of start-ups. Depending on the nature of the start-up, a five-member startup could create a much larger impact than a 50-person startup. Therefore, start-ups should be considered as potential source of innovation rather than solution for employment generation.

The GCC region too has caught-up with this global phenomenon and has some successful start-up stories to boast about. Start-ups are being projected as forerunners of economic growth through job creation and also pursued as the solution for job creation. However, to what extent this presumption about start-ups holds well is debatable.

Prior to answering the question-if start-ups can be key to the growing concern of unemployment in the region, the effectiveness of start-ups in job creation has to be assessed.  The Y-o-Y increase in jobs and establishment in the UAE across sectors most cases has resulted in incremental jobs. It is however obvious, that the growth in the jobs on the account of newer establishments coming into existence has be not been consistent within/across sectors.

For instance, the educational sector employment strength increased by 2,571 employees while 61 new establishments were set-up in 2013. Similar level of job creation was witnessed in 2015 in the financial sector but there were only 20 new establishment set-up.

Contrary to the trend in the financial sector discussed above, in the construction sector 1,086 new establishments were set-up in UAE in 2012, yet, the industry employment strength decreased by 28K. Similarly, the transportation sector witnessed a drop in number of establishments during the years 2012 and 2013, but this didn’t result it drop in the growth in employment, rather the sector employee strength increased by c.30K.

<strong>Start-ups a solution for job creation?</strong>
Looking at start-ups as a solution for job creation may not be a very wise stand. Based on the employment-established Y-o-Y growth/decline trend across sectors, it is evident that in most cases newer establishments have led to job creation. Though the newer establishments would have led to job creation, in some cases, they have failed to make an impact and the industry on the whole witnessed drop in employment.

The inherent high failure risk of start-ups could cause significant volatility in the job the market. The solution for the job creation should be more stable and consistent and not something which is unpredictable. Moreover, the early stage of start-ups would limit the employment generation, as they tend to run leaner operations to preserve cash and invest it in the business. The employee strength of the start-ups discussed in the table below establish the idiosyncratic nature of start-ups. Depending on the nature of the start-up, a five-member startup could create a much larger impact than a 50-person startup. Therefore, start-ups should be considered as potential source of innovation rather than solution for employment generation.

		<Title>[:en]SME Startup Stories in GCC - What can we learn?[:ar]ماذا يمكننا أن نتعلم من - قصص بدء المشاريع الصغيرة والمتوسطة في دول مجلس التعاون الخليجي؟[:]</Title>

These success stories highlight the value SMEs deliver to GCC economic imperatives. Even a cursory glance at the case studies reveal that these companies have shown remarkable prowess in identifying ideas that speak to customer pain points and have turned them into practical companies through actionable business models.

Another notable characteristic is that, in keeping with trends in the rest of the world, these companies have harnessed digital business platforms to drive their revenues, growth and scalability. Coinciding with the rise of the internet and information age, the success stories demonstrate that GCC has the potential, skills and the generic ecosystem to promote innovative small businesses that can go on to stake a place in the international trade architecture.

A striking feature of success in most of these companies profiled is the endeavor to customize products or services for users. Be it Talabat or Fetchr, the idea is to promote technological designs and greater investments into their services that will allow them to compete confidently with international competitors.

For some of the startup stories, there is at times the implication that they are regional clones of successful international companies. For e.g., Careem gets constantly compared to Uber. Bayt.com too gets compared with international players like Monster. However, these regional companies are at pains to explain that they are not just duplicates, but well-thought value adding services that cater to the diverse range of regional nuances and needs.

In general, there is the feeling that in many parts of the GCC, tough rules and prescriptive regulations stifle entrepreneurship. Yet, the featured success stories have, so far, shown what is possible. Thus, their models and histories need to be studied for developing a view of the SME ecosystem in the GCC, including the variations by country.

Moreover, these companies are a call to relevant authorities in the GCC to invest in innovation and people, so that SMEs that contain has the potential to be global companies can rise via sustainable business practices. In many ways, these companies have shown expertise in not only identifying trending or new opportunities in the larger environment, but have shown the capability to connect the needs of customers with satisfactory offerings. For e.g., Bayt (the online recruitment portal), was an early mover in the field of internet-based recruitment in the GCC. Over the years, the company has consistently innovated new services to keep adding greater value to clients, both in terms of recruiters and job seekers.

A key takeaway for GCC policymakers is that such SMEs can generate revenues and profits that can be ploughed back into the local economies, serving to strengthen the economic foundations with respect to private sector participation. Moreover, over time, if investment opportunities are available in such successful SMEs, an ecosystem of investors will develop in the buying and trading of stakes in SMEs, providing SMEs a viable source of funding.

In due course, to encourage emerging entrepreneurs, GCC governments may back the development of a separate segment for SMEs on the capital markets, similar to the ones already existing in Qatar and Dubai (UAE). The profiled SMEs have more than just connected sellers to products or services, but, they have raised the profile and significance of the SME segment in the overall economy. This will, over time, generate a web of supply chain relationships, thereby linking firms and even public sector entities into a sustainable cluster framework.

Often, innovators and entrepreneurs are isolated from a support system and face difficulties to find funding, partners or collaborators. Concrete social innovation requirements and possibilities must be communicated to entrepreneurs and institutions set up to support SMEs. The success of the profiled SMEs indicate that there are a large number of small businesses engaged in the field of social innovation that will enable them to find new markets, create new jobs and fine-tuning of innovative business models.

The profiled SMEs indicate that the GCC region is fertile ground for entrepreneurs to experiment and prosper. However, the regulations and the ecosystem is not very conducive for SMEs to start and continue. There are ample funding constraints and private sector investments in the form private equity or venture capital is scarce. Though there are models of crowdfunding coming up across the GCC, there are no structural legislations that will regulate and have oversight over them. Thus, for sustainable development of SMEs, there is a need for the development of a suitable ecosystem from the ground up. Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) act as the key source of job generation and economic value addition across the world. In the GCC, the ongoing economic changes will mean that SMEs will receive more persistent attention from governments and policymakers. Though there is a widespread feeling that SMEs do not face a conducive environment in the GCC and the wider MENA region, there are still a crop of SMEs that have done well. Let us learn from them.

The article originally appeared in The National | Business.

Traditional business models are being challenged by new disruptive technologies whose speed of development makes the "catch-up" act very difficult. However, if something can provide solutions to problems encountered by businesses and individuals, it is most certainly welcome. One of the biggest problems is faced by the large expat population in the region, which relies on remittances to transfer cash across borders. For an industry worth nearly US$100 billion in the GCC, and $19bn in the UAE alone, the process is quite time-consuming and expensive, with the banks, exchange companies and central banks functioning as intermediaries.

The remittance process is carried out through certain models – pre-fund models, post-fund models and subsidy models. The pre-fund model works on a corridor basis, for example, India-UAE, UAE-Pakistan, UAE-China etc, the pre-fund model allows the sending agent to quickly be able to settle the net amount with the beneficiary agent or bank, so that their customers can get the money quickly. In the post-fund model, the beneficiary bank advances the amount to the beneficiary and as a result they have to absorb the loss if the sending bank defaults.

All of these models add to the cost which is borne by either parties. For instance, in the pre-fund model, the transfer agent has to keep a certain sum of money as deposit with the receiving bank, in most cases, without interest to speedily complete the transaction. It also needs to have physical cash of the equivalent amount being sent to be present at their centres to settle the transaction, which again does not pay any interest.

Typically, the remittance process takes one to two days, involves a lengthy digital trail and has to go through the clearing process of central banks.

The costs for using such intermediaries has always been an issue for cross-border remittances. For instance, money transfer agents such as Western Union, MoneyGram etc, charge a flat fee of Dh10 to Dh20 irrespective of the amount being sent. Such transfer agents give the option of collecting the cash at their business centres in the receiving country or credit the amount to the receiver’s bank account. The former transaction takes about an hour, while the latter might take a day or two depending on the tie-ups that these transfer agents might have.

Enter Blockchain technology. And just what is that? Blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently, and allows users to verify transactions in real time without the need for a central authority.

Every new transaction is checked by the network and, when approved as valid, is added to the Blockchain.

So how could Blockchain disrupt the remittances industry? Reduced time – a typical Bitcoin transfer takes close to 10 minutes to be confirmed by the Blockchain network; imagine sending money to your relatives from abroad in that time as against one or two days in the present scenario.

Reduced cost – remittances from abroad typically cost about 5 per cent of the transaction; sending bank, receiving bank, clearing central banks all receive a cut in it; while Blockchain avoids these intermediaries, thereby reducing costs significantly.

According to Ripple, moving to Blockchain technology could reduce costs by up to 60 per cent in case of cross-border transactions. In the past, disruptive technologies have shown the capability to transform both business models across the spectrum.

Uber and Airbnb have disrupted traditional business models and have made incumbent players to change strategy at a rapid pace or risk irrelevance.

The remittances industry could very well find itself in that position should Blockchain start-ups succeed in convincing country regulators. Gearing up to the knowledge and adapting quickly is the only way out. Shape up or get shipped out.

According to Ripple, moving to Blockchain technology could reduce costs by up to 60 per cent in case of cross-border transactions. In the past, disruptive technologies have shown the capability to transform both business models across the spectrum.

Uber and Airbnb have disrupted traditional business models and have made incumbent players to change strategy at a rapid pace or risk irrelevance.

The remittances industry could very well find itself in that position should Blockchain start-ups succeed in convincing country regulators. Gearing up to the knowledge and adapting quickly is the only way out. Shape up or get shipped out.

		<Title>[:en]Who should worry most about VAT in the UAE?[:ar]من الذي يجب أن يقلق أكثر بشأن ضريبة القيمة المضافة في دولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة؟[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">

The article originally appeared in The National | Business.

By January 1, 2018, it is expected that value added tax (VAT) will be applied at a rate of 5 per cent on most goods and services in the UAE and wider GCC region.

The GCC governments will face a combined fiscal deficit of about US$350 billion over the next five years, according to the IMF, which bases its estimate on an oil price of $56 per barrel. This means that unless a government finds non-oil revenue to plug its deficit, it will be forced to borrow. VAT is an important source of non-oil revenue as it can bring in at least 1.5 per cent of GDP, or one-fourth of deficit.

While VAT is an indirect tax applied at every stage of the supply chain, the end effect of the levy is on consumers who finally pay the tax while buying a good or service. There are four important stakeholders in this VAT episode – governments (beneficiary), businesses (tax collectors), consumers (taxpayers) and consultants (VAT experts). So the question is who will be affected the most?

First, let us look at the government that will receive this VAT. Obviously being a beneficiary means that it need not worry about VAT. In fact it should be celebrating. However, as tax administrator, it may have to worry to see that it collects all the VAT that is collectible. It needs to create the necessary infrastructure and manpower to supervise and collect the VAT, and make sure that this does not dent the GCC’s image of a tax-free haven.

Second, consider the businesses that are supposed to collect the VAT and deposit it with the government. They should be the most worried since they will be the ones that have to perform an extra function, which could result in additional hiring and costs, although they do not receive a dir­ect economic incentive. If it is a question of simply collecting and remitting, then it may not be a big issue. However, being in the middle brings several complexities.

Most of the goods and ser­vices consumed in the UAE are imported, mostly from Eur­ope and Asia, and in some cases from other GCC countries. Countries can either exempt certain goods and services (VAT exempt) or can have a zero rate on some products. While exempt categories can remain exempt, zero-rated products can be increased in future. Here comes the problem. What if something VAT exempt in one country need not be VAT exempt in the GCC, and vice versa? Also, what is set as 0 per cent VAT in a recipient country need not be 0 per cent in UAE, and vice versa. So if a good is taxed in the source country and VAT-exempt in the UAE, then businesses in the middle may be stuck in that they may not be able to claim a VAT refund.

For example, goods classified as foodstuffs have a VAT range of 7 to 19 per cent in Germany, 4 to 10 per cent in Spain, and 0 to 20 per cent in the UK.

Meanwhile, for books the VAT is a flat 7 per cent in Germany, 4 to 21 per cent in Spain, and 0 per cent in the UK.

In these cases, companies will have to take a call on either absorbing the VAT (which will reduce the margin) or passing it on to consumers (which will reduce the market share). Such a squeeze can also affect working capital and cash flows. In summary, cost of doing business will go up for companies.

In order to collect and remit VAT, companies have to incorporate VAT systems in their accounting. There are several challenges that UAE companies will face here – updating of IT systems, training of staff to be VAT-compliant, renegotiation of supply contracts, inadvertent errors that could prove costly, etc. Such complexities will warrant employing VAT professionals fam­iliar with the process. The region with deep VAT experience is Europe and, hence, sourcing VAT professionals from Europe can add to cost.

Third are the end consumers who pay the VAT. Since this is a tax that is added to the product cost, the consumer has a choice to ­either buy the product or defer the purchase. Since the VAT rate is only 5 per cent, initially the consumers may not even notice it and may confuse the increase with inflation (presuming the price increases are passed on to consumers rather than being absorbed by companies). However, as the VAT rate goes up over time (the average VAT rate in the world is around 15 per cent), consumers may resist buying the end product. If oil prices remain low, there is a good possibility of VAT rates moving up over time. Consumers might resist this by deferring a purchase, whether it be a house or a fridge.

Finally, what does it mean for the consultants that help companies set up the VAT systems and enable them to be VAT-compliant? Given the complexity associated with administering VAT, businesses will have to engage these consultants. VAT opens up a huge new line of business opportunity for consultants. Already the big four have a dedicated VAT division to help companies. It is certainly party time for them.

Hence, the stakeholder that should worry the most about VAT will obviously be businesses. But there is one small mercy – it is expected that SMEs will be exempted from VAT administration.

		<Title>[:en][Gulf Business] Alternative financing options for the GCC[:ar]]أعمال الخليج[ خيارات التمويل البديل لدول مجلس التعاون الخليجي[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">

The article originally appeared in <a href="http://gulfbusiness.com/alternative-financing-options-gcc/">Gulf Business.</a>

Traditional financing options, such as bank funding, continue to rule the roost in the Gulf region.

Rising oil exports led to large government revenues, which usually ended up as deposits in the region’s banking system and constituted a significant source of low-cost funds. However, the current lower oil price environment and the resulting budgetary deficits have forced market participants to look at alternative sources of funding, such as private equity, venture capital, peer-to-peer lending, crowdfunding, and project bonds among others.

In the GCC, banks constitute the lion’s share of financing – not only for corporates, but also for government project financing. Recently, however, funding by banks has lost steam due to a host of factors, such as a liquidity squeeze, regulatory constraints and the need to support government bond programmes.

Interest rates have increased during the past year across the region – more so in the major economies of the UAE and Saudi Arabia – and are likely to rise in tandem with a hike in US Federal Reserve rates to facilitate the maintenance of currency pegs.

Consequently, the interbank rates, a key benchmark used for pricing loans, have continually increased in the past 12 months. Increasing fund raising activities of the government to pay back debt and to bridge burgeoning deficits have squeezed domestic liquidity, thereby crowding out the private sector.

According to Marmore’s report on financing options in the GCC, large corporates in the region have taken a clue from the government issuances and started to tap bond markets – local as well as international.

<img src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Alternative-Financing-Options-GCC-for-the-GCC-fig1.jpg" alt="GCC Equity Risk Premia" />

However, GCC markets lack an active secondary market for bond issues, which acts as a constraint for investors. And while there is demand for sovereign issuances, corporate issuances have faced withdrawals after liquidity dried up in the primary markets. Add the fact S&P credit rating agencies downgraded the ratings of Saudi Arabia, Oman and Bahrain, citing pressures created by drop in oil prices on their finances, and you can expect fiscal and external balances to weaken further. This will increase the cost of funds for corporates.

Besides having access to bank loans at competitive rates, issuance of corporate bonds (including sukuks) in the GCC are also largely restricted to the bigger companies.

Credit default swap (CDS) spreads have widened in the recent past, which also reflects the deteriorating credit outlook for GCC sovereigns. In the past two years, the CDS spreads of Oman, Qatar and Bahrain have doubled while those of Saudi Arabia have tripled. Bond investors are demanding wider spreads, which implies significant deterioration of the liquidity in the banking sector and adversely affects the loan market. The uncertain outlook for GCC economies has resulted in volatile equity markets. And this in turn has led to increased equity premium for GCC markets.

Since the highs witnessed in 2014, the initial public offering (IPO) market has remain muted owing to poor investor participation following subdued valuations and depressed market sentiment.

Last year saw only six IPOs, compared to 16 in 2014, and the decline in investor confidence has led to the cancellation of many listings.

Instead, the rights issue of shares has gained popularity in the region, with 97 rights issues that were either closed or listed during 2010-15, raising close to $20.7bn. Whereas, preference shares in the region have not been able to achieve critical mass owing to two major factors – regulations and long lock-in periods.

Most GCC countries allow the issuing of preference shares only through the form of private placements, which combined with lock-in periods of up to three years discourages investor interest.

In the GCC, private equity (PE) is still at a nascent stage, and has been subdued with single digit fund closures in the last five years – barring 2014 – which witnessed the closure of 11 PE funds. In 2015, PE funds raised in the region declined by 78 per cent, and the number of issues fell by 81 per cent. Marmore estimates more activity in the private equity space as an alternative form of financing going forward.

In 2016, it was estimated that there was close to a $26bn gap in small and medium enterprise (SME) funding, at a time when SMEs in the region are increasingly pessimistic about the outlook for growth, as oil prices remain unusually low.

<img src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Alternative-Financing-Options-GCC-for-the-GCC-fig2.jpg" alt="Alternative Forms of Financing has gained prominence" />

Credit penetration to SMEs in the GCC, as measured in the form of bank loans, is among the worlds lowest and hovers around 2 per cent, compared to 26 per cent in Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. Banks in the region demand higher collateral, stricter documentation and shorter tenors from the smaller players.

SME exchange is a relatively new concept in the GCC region, with simpler listing laws than the main exchange, which not only facilitates SMEs to access alternative sources of funding but also improves corporate governance among SMEs. It also provides an option to move onto the main stock exchange – when minimum requirements are met – without an IPO.

Saudi Arabia is working to finalize rules for a new SME stock exchange, which it could launch by early 2017. The new exchange is expected to have lower minimum capital requirements in the single digits, as opposed to the main Tadawul exchange. In the UAE, to facilitate bond issuance by SMEs, the minimum issue size of bonds has been decreased from $13.5m to $2.7m, which could increase SME participation in the bond markets.

Alternative financing forms such as project bonds and IOUs have gained prominence in the past two years as lower oil prices have altered the financing landscape in the GCC region.

In addition, crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending have also caught the region’s fancy, with an increasing number of technology start-ups relying on crowdsourcing to start their business or to expand their operations.

New lending platforms are set to transform credit evaluation and loan origination, as well as open up consumer lending to non-traditional sources of capital. This will intensify competition in the financial services sector and narrow spreads between deposits and loans, thereby affecting the profitability of financial institutions.

The world of finance has seen asset bubbles every few years and the occurrences of a crisis seem to have a shortened cycle in the past eighty years. Since the 1960’s, the world has seen some extended and protracted asset bubbles – Japanese real estate (1980-2003), Japanese stocks (1982-1992), Tech Bubble (late 90’s to early 2000), U.S subprime crisis (2003-2011), Chinese stock market (2005-2008), Oil (2005-2008) are arguably some of the crisis that vaporised millions of dollars’ worth of wealth. Some of the other historically remarkable crisis in the history includes Tulip mania (1619-1622), Mississippi Bubble (1716-1719) and South Sea Bubble (1719-1722). All of the crises share a similar trait – investor euphoria, hubris followed by an equal disbelief when prices comes crashing down. In all of these bubbles, investors strongly believe that they have made a good investment regardless of the price that they pay and there would always be someone to buy at a higher price.

In this light, bitcoin rally is nothing short of spectacular despite the warnings from industry watchers of bitcoin being a bubble. Some analysts called it a bubble when the bitcoin was trading at USD 1,000 but were left in the dust by the bitcoin’s relentless rally. An interesting fact about bitcoin is that the rally has mostly been fuelled by individual groups without much participation from the stalwarts of Wall Street, which we see as being consistent with the currency’s founding principles of being anti-establishment and fully decentralized.

Search “Bitcoin” on google and you’ll be welcomed by a stream of advertisements that would most likely contain the phrases “Are you looking to invest in bitcoins?”, “Bitcoin investment at low fees?” and “How to buy bitcoins?” Bitcoin started off as an utopian experiment that was aimed at solving the problem with fiat money and reducing the mechanics that go onto put the trust that fiat currencies have (central banks, treasury, full faith of the government etc. costs money and not always explicit). But the palpable enthusiasm with which bitcoin is trading now seems to undermine all that qualities that made it appealing in the first place and now risks being seen as merely speculative investment which could very well turn out to be a bubble.

Bitcoin enthusiasts argue that cryptocurrencies are rapidly transforming into mainstream currency and that it will offer serious competition and eventually replace the existing national currencies issued by central banks. Further, the current euphoria surrounding the rally is seen as a validation of bitcoin’s claim as the currency of future. Finite supply and the disruptive technology that underpins its functioning – ‘block chain’ has added to its exotic appeal.

On the other hand, financial commentators have been quick to point out the dot com bubble as a cautionary example. Acceptance of bitcoin as a widespread medium of exchange for the purpose of trade and commerce is yet to be seen. Recent research by Morgan Stanley noted that the bitcoin’s acceptance is “virtually zero” and declining. It pointed out that only three of the top 500 online merchants accept bitcoin as a form of payment.

<strong>Are bitcoins in a bubble?</strong>
In financial markets, bubbles are spotted by comparing the traded price of an asset to its fair or fundamental value. For stocks, the earnings are compared to its stock price. For commodities such as oil or metals, the cost of production along with demand/supply dynamics dictates the price trends. For currencies, real effective exchange rates are of help. The primary problem with valuing or pricing bitcoin is the lack of a mechanism for valuing them or pricing them based on fundamentals; none exists.

Bitcoin also does not fit in the framework of a conventional investment. With no clear cut way to establish valuation using the fundamental parameters, and no observable relationship with economic or other parameters, bitcoin price is established purely based on demand/supply dynamics. Price rise defy gravity when limited supply is met with insatiable demand. Bitcoin supply is capped at 21million and an estimated 16.7million has already been mined. Even among the existing supply, a few million is expected to have been lost forever due to hard disk damages and forgotten passwords. Scarcity premium and lack of means to establish fair value offers a fertile ground for speculators.

<strong>What explains the stellar rally?</strong>
The fear of missing out on stellar gains that could be achieved within a short span of time, days or even hours, has likely pulled people from all walks of life towards bitcoin. Traditional assets offering minimal yields in a low interest rate environment could have pushed investors into risky bets such as bitcoin. Those who have experienced the burst of dot com bubble could recollect the eerie similarities in bitcoin rally that is fuelled by emotion rather than underlying fundamentals.

But the palpable enthusiasm with which bitcoin is trading now seems to undermine all that qualities that made it appealing in the first place and now risks being seen as merely speculative investment which could very well turn out to be a bubble.

Bitcoin enthusiasts argue that cryptocurrencies are rapidly transforming into mainstream currency and that it will offer serious competition and eventually replace the existing national currencies issued by central banks. Further, the current euphoria surrounding the rally is seen as a validation of bitcoin’s claim as the currency of future. Finite supply and the disruptive technology that underpins its functioning – ‘block chain’ has added to its exotic appeal.

On the other hand, financial commentators have been quick to point out the dot com bubble as a cautionary example. Acceptance of bitcoin as a widespread medium of exchange for the purpose of trade and commerce is yet to be seen. Recent research by Morgan Stanley noted that the bitcoin’s acceptance is “virtually zero” and declining. It pointed out that only three of the top 500 online merchants accept bitcoin as a form of payment.

<strong>Are bitcoins in a bubble?</strong>
In financial markets, bubbles are spotted by comparing the traded price of an asset to its fair or fundamental value. For stocks, the earnings are compared to its stock price. For commodities such as oil or metals, the cost of production along with demand/supply dynamics dictates the price trends. For currencies, real effective exchange rates are of help. The primary problem with valuing or pricing bitcoin is the lack of a mechanism for valuing them or pricing them based on fundamentals; none exists.

Bitcoin also does not fit in the framework of a conventional investment. With no clear cut way to establish valuation using the fundamental parameters, and no observable relationship with economic or other parameters, bitcoin price is established purely based on demand/supply dynamics. Price rise defy gravity when limited supply is met with insatiable demand. Bitcoin supply is capped at 21million and an estimated 16.7million has already been mined. Even among the existing supply, a few million is expected to have been lost forever due to hard disk damages and forgotten passwords. Scarcity premium and lack of means to establish fair value offers a fertile ground for speculators.

<strong>What explains the stellar rally?</strong>
The fear of missing out on stellar gains that could be achieved within a short span of time, days or even hours, has likely pulled people from all walks of life towards bitcoin. Traditional assets offering minimal yields in a low interest rate environment could have pushed investors into risky bets such as bitcoin. Those who have experienced the burst of dot com bubble could recollect the eerie similarities in bitcoin rally that is fuelled by emotion rather than underlying fundamentals.

UAE has been at the forefront of technology adoption in the GCC region. From its adoption of open data to making block chain mandatory for government transactions by 2020, UAE perceives technology as a great enabler in propelling its country forward. It has kick-started initiatives from time to time in sync with the progress of the technology. Dubai announced its first ICT (Information and Communication Technology) strategy way back in 1999 and has followed it up with the launch of Dubai Internet City, Dubai e-government, Dubai Smart Government and more recently the smart Dubai Initiative in 2014. Abu Dhabi’s initiatives came almost half a decade later in 2005 when the Emirates adopted Information technology in its government departments, authorities and administrators. UAE has always been ranked high among the Middle East countries owing to these initiatives and given the fact that consumption side of digital technology has been higher while supply side lags behind which the government is addressing through its push via its pursuit of digital initiatives.

What makes UAE stand out from the rest of nations in the GCC region is the fact that the digitisation has been one of government’s major prerogative and not an afterthought. As part of UAE Vision 2021, the National Innovation Strategy identified digital technology as one of the top seven primary national sectors. This strategy focuses on the development of smart cities, software, and applications including advanced technology in areas of global interest such as artificial intelligence, semiconductors, nanotechnology, and 3D printing, as well as the quick adoption of technology across various industries.

UAE sees embracing digital as the way forward for providing increased job opportunities for its population. UAE’s population increased more than any other region in the world during the second half of 20th century. McKinsey estimates that the UAE captures close to 16.4% of the digital potential compared to 18% for the U.S; the UAE government is clearly focused on bridging and even surpassing that gap. Its Smart Dubai initiative encompasses projects that include Happiness Meter, Smart District, Dubai Data, Smart Dubai and Dubai Blockchain. UAE’s citizens have seamlessly adopted to new trends and technologies, for example UAE has one of the highest mobile phone penetration rates at close to 70 to 80% of the population, one of the highest globally. Social media usage is also widespread – WhatsApp and Facebook is used by 97% and 89% of the population respectively followed by YouTube at 73% making them one of the highest in the world.

Two of the UAE’s projects standout in its digital pursuit – the Dubai Open Data and Dubai Blockchain project.

<strong>Dubai Open Data </strong>
Data has transformed the way the world has moved in the past few years. Google, Facebook , Amazon etc. have all chalked up and used these data to create huge amount of values for the users as well as the company . Using Artificial Intelligence (AI), Google and Amazon have been able to spot trends that are not immediately obvious – such as the recording consumer buying patterns and suggesting new products based on the purchasing pattern. Governments have only been undertaking pilot projects when coming to Big data and AI in this aspect, UAE has been one of the pioneers in trying to utilize the data to transform the nation.

Dubai’s open data is one of the most ambitious project undertaken by the government of UAE. Estimates by KPMG states that by 2021, open and shared data has the potential to add USD 2.8Bn to the economy every year in terms of Gross Value Added. This estimate includes the impact of publishing and sharing both private and government sector data. That’s an additional USD 1,080 per person added to the economy.

The big value drivers of impact for Dubai are the transport, storage and communication sector; the public administration sector; wholesale, retail trade, restaurants and hotels sector; and the real estate sector. Opening up the data in these sectors would be a great value addition. These four sectors account for approximately three-quarters of the estimated potential GVA impact of open data in Dubai. Opening up the government data alone will result in an added value of in the range of USD 1.1 to 1.7Bn annually as of 2021. This is equivalent to approximately 0.8% to 1.2% of Dubai’s forecasted GDP for 2021, a significant addition. The high level estimates set out above provide an indication of the potential overall impact at the aggregate Dubai economy level.

One of the most important parts of the Dubai Data Initiative is Dubai Pulse, the centralized platform which will host all of Dubai’s data. The platform, announced earlier this year, is a single repository and platform for all data from government and private sector sources. The platform is intended for all users, from government personnel through to academics, and start-ups to access the data. Data in Pulse is organised into three layers of free open data, analytics for academic, professional, commercial, and economic purposes which will be available for a fee, and a third layer of data which will be available only to Dubai government entities.

<strong>Dubai Block Chain Strategy</strong>
Blockchain is a distributed ledger system that relies on a decentralized data validation and secured using cryptography. Banks have shown tremendous interest in developing and adopting the blockchain within their systems seeing the obvious benefits of the technology. While currently the most popular usage of block chain has been related to the digital currency “Bitcoin” but the idea has been adopted by a number of other developers to develop private block chain which could be used in other areas as well.

The Dubai Blockchain strategy is another pioneering project from the government of Dubai to digitize the government archives. Dubai has been targeting to use the digital ledger to efficiently share and track information related to contracts and transactions, the records of which are permanent, verifiable and secure. With most of the government records currently being done through paper, it takes a lot of time and money to process, store and retrieve them. In addition to this, it also affects the government efficiency.

Under this blockchain strategy the government plans to reduce the documentation required for visa applications, bill payments and license renewals, which account for over 100 million documents each year. Real estate has been the first department to go ahead with the implementation of the plan. It would allow investors residing in Dubai and abroad to verify property data which would be backed by a timestamp. Real estate transactions in Dubai have a huge load of paperwork that is needed to scrutinize before the purchase could be made. Block chain allows for enhanced data accuracy, credibility of transactions and transparency in the market. In October, the Dubai Land Department (DLD) announced that it was developing a system that would record all of the local real estate contract on a blockchain.

Leasing is another part of the problem that is being addressed through this shift to a block chain model. Renters would be able to link up landlords as well as utilities such as electrical, water and telecommunications. Most of the transactions currently takes place through checks and this project aims to help the renters pay them through electronic channels. In order to help achieve this goal, the Dubai legal department has tied up with Asset Management Group, Emirates NBD, IKEA and Emirates Identity Authority.

Given that UAE has one of the most important event, the Expo 2020, coming up, successful adoption and implementation of the above projects would help the showcase the technical prowess of the UAE in a very positive light. Both of these projects could help start a more open approach to sharing data and adopting new technologies by governments globally. Perhaps it might even help shackle the image that government sector are the ones that are most afraid of change and are bloated with bureaucracy. On successful adoption these projects has the potential to even serve as benchmarks for other cities which is planning to build a city of its own with technology built right in the foundation.

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">

This fright has turned into a reality in many developed markets like US, where the accelerated shift of Americans shopping via internet has pushed several retail companies into bankruptcy. Approximately 8,640 stores with 147mn square feet of retailing space is expected to close down in US during 2017 (Source: Credit Suisse).  The fact that number of stores expected to close in 2017, surpasses the level of closures after the financial crisis and dotcom bust, signifies the enormity of the threat the conventional retail industry faces from the e-commerce segment.

The current state of the US conventional retail segment prompts the need to address the following questions in the GCC context.

</div>
<ul>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Is this fear for real and can the GCC malls face a similar scenario in the near future?</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Does this present a great opportunity for the GCC retailer to transform and embrace technology to improve their business?</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

We delve into this incongruity and try to understand if online can really beat offline sales in the GCC as it is feared in the developed markets.

<strong>Size matters… </strong>
The GCC e-commerce industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 30% to reach from USD 5bn in 2015 to USD 20bn at the end of 2020. While, the conventional retail market size in GCC is expected to be at USD 206 billion by 2020 registering a CAGR of 4% during the same period. Though the pace at which the regional e-commerce industry is expected to grow is commendable, it would only account for 10% of the entire regional retail sales. Given the size of the conventional retail industry in the region, it would take the e-commerce segment considerable duration before it poses a major threat. We believe there is enough space for both segments currently and physical stores have time to pull up their socks and think of ways to beat the online competition. The fear is not so near as generally perceived.

<strong>Malls yet to reach saturation levels</strong>
The conventional segment in the region is still in its growth stage. Some of the factors that testify that the industry is yet to reach saturation are the steady supply of the retail real estate, lower concentration of the market, limited presence of international players and consumer spending.

The numerous mall developments in the pipeline are a testament to immense opportunities in the sector. Unlike, the US market which witnessed dramatic overbuilding of stores resulting in excessive retail space, the retail space density in most of the GCC countries is still sparse. The GLA retail space per capita in US is around 2.3sq m (4.6 sq m, if small shopping centers and independent retailers are added)(Source: Forbes) as against 1.39sq m in Dubai and 1.48sq m in Abu Dhabi. These numbers indicate that there is still enough room for conventional retail space to grow.

<strong>Cultural Influence</strong>
The divergent cultural and climatic aspects of the GCC region from the US and European markets, emphasize the need to gauge the regional retail industry differently. Larger and well bonded families, regular outings, high per capita spending and lack of other entertainment avenues make malls an exciting place to be. Mall of Emirates is the seventh most productive shopping centre across the world earning USD 1,423 per square feet per annum (Source: International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC)). Emaar Malls collectively had 125 million visitors during 2016, similar to annual footfall during 2015. While, Dubai Mall being the most visited shopping destination attracted over 80million visitors for third consecutive year since 2014 compared to 65 miilion visitors in 2012. This is higher than the total number of visitors to Niagara Falls & Central Park (NY) put together. Going to the mall is an integral part of the region’s culture. Malls offer a unique proposition of entertainment plus shopping and continue to be the choice of destination for shoppers as it offers a wholesome experience.

<strong>The other side of the story-challenges faced by online retailers</strong>
While the customers are gradually favouring online purchases there are region specific impediments to the growth. The biggest hurdle for the growth of E-commerce industry in the region is the lack of consumer trust and awareness. The GCC consumers are still wary of shopping online, fearing fraud, data security and privacy issues. Moreover, the e-commerce ecosystem such as digital banking distribution and logistical infrastructure is largely underdeveloped. The GCC banking industry is facing huge challenges in meeting customer expectations in digital experience, relatively few people have credit cards and online payment systems are in their infancy. The region still relies heavily on cash-on-delivery which makes an online shopping operation even more difficult to manage. Cash-on-delivery can result in problems with returns or undelivered items, and often means higher costs, making it an unattractive option.

<strong>To adapt or perish</strong>
For now e-commerce industry doesn’t pose considerable threat to the GCC region’s physical retail. However, if conventional retailers are too complacent and fail to react to the changing trend, they are likely to lose their market share as witnessed in developed markets. A viable option for the conventional retailers is to adopt to the hybrid retail model, which involves having both an online and offline store presence. Using a brick and click model, retailers can leverage upon their e-commerce sites by providing information about the latest products, sales, and deals in a physical store. This in return attracts customers to the physical store either to look at the product or to collect their purchased product. This way the hybrid model is a win-win arrangement for both the conventional retailers and the customers.

While, Dubai Mall being the most visited shopping destination attracted over 80million visitors for third consecutive year since 2014 compared to 65 miilion visitors in 2012. This is higher than the total number of visitors to Niagara Falls &amp; Central Park (NY) put together. Going to the mall is an integral part of the region’s culture. Malls offer a unique proposition of entertainment plus shopping and continue to be the choice of destination for shoppers as it offers a wholesome experience.

<strong>The other side of the story-challenges faced by online retailers</strong>
While the customers are gradually favouring online purchases there are region specific impediments to the growth. The biggest hurdle for the growth of E-commerce industry in the region is the lack of consumer trust and awareness. The GCC consumers are still wary of shopping online, fearing fraud, data security and privacy issues. Moreover, the e-commerce ecosystem such as digital banking distribution and logistical infrastructure is largely underdeveloped. The GCC banking industry is facing huge challenges in meeting customer expectations in digital experience, relatively few people have credit cards and online payment systems are in their infancy. The region still relies heavily on cash-on-delivery which makes an online shopping operation even more difficult to manage. Cash-on-delivery can result in problems with returns or undelivered items, and often means higher costs, making it an unattractive option.

<strong>To adapt or perish</strong>
For now e-commerce industry doesn’t pose considerable threat to the GCC region’s physical retail. However, if conventional retailers are too complacent and fail to react to the changing trend, they are likely to lose their market share as witnessed in developed markets. A viable option for the conventional retailers is to adopt to the hybrid retail model, which involves having both an online and offline store presence. Using a brick and click model, retailers can leverage upon their e-commerce sites by providing information about the latest products, sales, and deals in a physical store. This in return attracts customers to the physical store either to look at the product or to collect their purchased product. This way the hybrid model is a win-win arrangement for both the conventional retailers and the customers.

Trading at a premium would be an understatement to refer to FAANG stocks as they trade at stratospheric valuations (price to earnings ratio). Analysing all possibilities, we could for sure say one thing, what is driving the valuation is the frenzied investor behaviour of paying too much today for earnings that are likely to accrue in the distant future. So, what are we paying for? – Investor irrationality.

History tells us that investors have similar investment patterns in the past when it comes to US tech stocks. This kind of overexcited investing in tech stocks was the root cause of the catastrophic collapse of the stock markets after the dotcom bubble in 1999. Technology itself seemed to be an impressive business plan for the investors those days. Hence, these tech companies also spent more money on marketing their company to investors. However, markets turned to reality sooner, leading to the crash right at the start of the millennium. Poor financial management, lack of profit generating activities and no vision for the future business pushed investors to realize that tech companies can no longer be their exquisite investments. Many tech firms delisted, closed their offices and some even went bankrupt. In 1999, there were more than 200 companies that filed for an IPO in NASDAQ and vanished after the markets crashed in 2001.

Analysts who have either given a strong buy/buy recommendation for Amazon estimate that 92% of the price paid is for earnings that would be reaped after 2020(The Economist). In a decade, it is estimated that Amazon would trade at a PE of 10x. Amazon’s customer base is expected to reach 788 mn by 2025 generating a revenue of USD 3 trillion (almost the size of India’s GDP). Amazon’s valuations can be only justified by the exponential growth in its revenue, never with the earnings the company has made in the past nor with that anticipated for the future. Technology is an arena where ten years is too large a time horizon. 10 years before, products that were pioneers in use are no more existent today. With iPhone having being introduced, Apple was forced to kill its one master innovation, the iPod. Nobody thought of cloud hosting and the widespread use of internet two decades before. Technological breakthroughs generally disrupt the existing business models and can change the landscape of a sector/ companies that were till then operating quite successfully. This threatens the basis of estimating earnings for the future, especially in the longer term.

Net income has never moved in line with the revenues of the company, rather stayed divergent for almost 25 years. The chart above conveys the business model of Amazon, their focus has been to drive down prices and gain market share, which they have quite successfully done in the past three decades. Investors still believe that Amazon is in its nascent stages, and it could turn around to make profits and generate returns for the shareholders. This can happen only if the utopian dream of creating a monopolistic retail and web services market comes true. What would happen if Amazon increases the price of its services when it feels there are no more competitors? This strategy of cannibalising market share by reducing price has never worked out in the long term. The prospect of future earnings cannot happen just by holding market share. For now, Silicon Valley majors seem to have lost ground of their unique proposition – ‘Innovation’, which was at the heart of their organizations when they were incubated.

Similar stories seem to appear on many walls of Silicon Valley. Google and Facebook depend on their advertising revenue to a larger extent. When there is another technological innovation threatening their business, these tech giants have engaged in acquisitions at unimaginable valuations. The large tech companies are unable to innovate new income generating activities in-house, and with a huge cash reserve they have all decided to look for inorganic growth. The classic example would be the acquisition of Whatsapp by Facebook after facing tough competition from Google. The private messenger service ‘Whatsapp’ was valued at USD 19 Bn and acquired by Facebook in 2014. Apple has acquired more than 20 companies in the last two years. It is a qualm if these firms could run for years like these, without innovating in house and focus on profit making activities. Technology has too many competitors to acquire and to enter into price wars.

Snapchat’s IPO listing defeats it all, where the loss making company offered no voting rights to investors and the prospectus stated that it has no intention of paying cash dividends for the foreseeable future. The prospectus states that the company expects operating losses to continue in the future and may never achieve or maintain profitability in the coming years. The company is yet valued at $18.5bn. This displays the passivity of investors towards tech investing, owing which US tech companies afford to lack corporate governance, claim to make losses, deny rights to shareholders, and yet attract investments.

Majors in the Silicon Valley, Apple, Microsoft and Google have been more attractive in terms of their valuations compared to companies such as Amazon, Netflix and Facebook. Product and service line diversification of Microsoft and Apple have generated consistent profits for these companies, unlike in case of the others. Not all tech stocks run similar risks and are not equally overvalued. However, a majority of them, especially those struggling to generate profits are stocks that thrive on the promise of glorious tomorrow.

All said and done, Amazon is just a classic case of fundamentally weak but an overvalued stock. The situation may not be indicating another bubble in the stock markets as in 1999, though nothing much has changed about the way investors have picked companies. In the long run, disconnect between the revenues and the ability to generate profits is a risk that many tech companies have embedded in their business models. Investors have unfortunately failed to take notice of the same.

Bottom line for investors – ‘Look for bottom line numbers before investing’.

 	<li>Exchange fees – Basic fees for exchange operations. It is calculated depending on currencies and coins exchanged.</li>
 	<li>Trade fees – This is the fee to trade between currencies on the exchange. The Maker fee is the cost to make an offer to sell a currency on the exchange. The Taker fee is the fee to take an offer someone else has made.</li>

 	<li> Bitcoins available in the wallet can be sold through the exchanges at spot rate.</li>

</ul>
<strong>Bitcoin ATMs</strong>
A bitcoin ATM is an internet machine that allows a person to exchange bitcoins and cash. Some Bitcoin ATMs offer bi-directional functionality (both buying and selling is allowed). In some cases, Bitcoin ATM providers require users to have an existing account in order to transact on the machine. Bitcoin ATMs are the most private way of obtaining them, as the purchaser, in general, does not require to furnish any details. However, some bitcoin ATMs now require users to register themselves with the service providers.

There are 1,369 bitcoin ATMs installed across 56 countries in the world. In GCC, there is a buy-only bitcoin ATM in Jubail International Market. Most of the ATMs are located in the US, Canada, and Europe. There are online websites and mobile apps that help to find out the bitcoin ATMs across the world (<a href="https://coinatmradar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coinatmradar</a> ). Each ATM has its own transaction limit and permissible currency that can be used for the transaction.
<ul class="rdetails_list">
 	<li> Bitcoin ATM machines collect cash (usually local currency or USD) and in exchange provide equivalent bitcoins. Bitcoins are dispensed either to the buyer’s own Bitcoin wallet (via scanned QR code on the buyer’s mobile device or paper wallet), or to a paper wallet generated and printed by the ATM at the time of purchase.</li>
 	<li>In some ATMs, bitcoins can be deposited and cash can be collected in return.</li>
</ul>
Genesis, BitAccess, and Robocoin are some of the popular bitcoin ATMs. All these ATMs charge a service fee for every transaction.

<strong>Direct buying and selling:</strong>
Though a rare mechanism in use, it is possible to transfer bitcoins to other persons directly for a price. As cryptocurrencies are not regulated, such direct buying and selling without the need for exchanges can happen. It is anticipated that such transactions could be popular among those using cryptocurrencies as these exchanges do not offer any counter-party risk either. The only advantage of using the exchanges in place of direct transactions is the reputation they have earned in the past, due to which exchanges are perceived to be less riskier compared to one-to-one transactions.

<strong>Risks involved:</strong>
Not only are cryptocurrencies risky due to their volatile nature, the nascent stages of their development, the lack of clarity on who’s who as in the case of bitcoins and many other cryptocurrencies are some other major risks that are inherent. Few countries such as the US, Canada, Australia, and the UK have legalized the use of cryptocurrencies. However, they remain outside the purview of regulations for their transactions and exchange operations. The chance of default, dishonor of payments and insolvency is high for the trading parties and exchanges.

Apart from the above-mentioned risks, there have been allegations of misuse of bitcoins for illegal purposes. As most nations are compliant with treaties such as anti-money laundering and are a part of the financial action task force (FATF), there is a possibility that nations may take the direction against cryptocurrencies provided allegations are proved.

Cryptocurrencies offer a high-yielding and attractive investment option for investors in GCC and elsewhere, despite the bundle of risks associated.

Threat of disruption of a business now extends to almost all of the divisions – finance, operations, customer data, sales, R&D, IP. While this should make cybersecurity a mandate of the board and stakeholders, in many of the organizations the threat is still dealt by the IT department solely. Experts shake their heads in disapproval and opine that cybersecurity risk requires an institution-wide approach and better harmony between cybersecurity and business strategy.

The problem with cybersecurity is its complexity and heterogeneity. There are companies that offer or specialise in one particular service and there are companies that offer the entire gamut of services. Cyberattacks too range from easily identifiable phishing mails – “Well know Nigerian prince with a lot of money” to sophisticated ransomware attacks – “Wannacry” and DDOS “Denial of Service Attacks”. Phishing, the most common form of email attacks tries to trick the victims into paying a small transaction fee, in return for a reward. DDOS attacks are used to bring a site down by generating an unusually large number of requests from computers.  The most recent and the most damaging of these cyberattacks has been that of ransomwares. Ransomware attacks involve the hackers taking control of a computer system, encrypting it and holding it hostage until a ransom is paid.

Ransomware attacks begin as a harmless attachment that comes in email or other means. Once the ransomware is opened, there is not much that happens in the foreground, instead it activates the encryption software that starts to encrypt these system files one-by-one. Big companies have robust detection  mechanisms that isolate encrypted files and prevent any further encryption. Smaller companies unfortunately don’t have such capabilities to detect such attacks at an earlier stage. Instead they end up paying their ransom and recovering data or in worst case scenarios lose their data. The ransomware attacks are so well organised that they even own dedicated customer support with a live person at the other end helping out victims to recover their files and pay-out the ransom as well.

Business – big and small are now putting their minds together to solve the issue of cybersecurity. Investment and M&A activity in this space has gathered pace since 2014 which is a sign of more demand in for such services in the future. Estimates vary widely as to the extent of spending on cybersecurity, some analysts expect the cumulative spending on cyber security to surpass USD 1 Tn by 2021.   When the spending is expected to be of that magnitude, investment from the PE and VCs cannot be far behind.

The privately held companies saw a flutter of activities in 2016.  In 2016 alone there were close to 400 deals that took place in that space, up from 378 deals that took place in 2015. There were four deals in 2016 that exceeded the USD 100 Mn mark - StackPath (USD 180 Mn private equity), LogicMonitor (USD 130Mn growth equity), Cylance (USD 100Mn Series D), and Mobi Magic (USD 100Mn Series B). 2016’s flurry of deals shows that cybersecurity remains a hot investment opportunity in the wake of persistent security attacks and hacks faced by business and government. Investors are still predominately making bets in early-stage cybersecurity companies (seed & Series A), an indication that in an evolving cyber-threat landscape, new solutions are still needed that can help mitigate, and perhaps even predict, attacks. The amount of investment and the activity in the space seems to suggest that this industry is still in a growth phase which might not be suitable investment option for investors with low risk appetite.

Analysing the cybersecurity stock performance over the past three years we are able to find out that the most of the mid and large cap companies have had positive revenue as well as stock performance. Nine companies have had double digit revenue growth in the past three years. Demand for cyber security awareness about the products have been an important reason behind the revenue blitzkrieg.

<img src=" https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Increasing-cyberattacks-blog-fig1.jpg " alt="" />

The revenue growth notwithstanding the net income performance of most of these companies have not been so spectacular. Out of the 20 companies that featured in our analysis 15 of the companies had faced losses in 2016. 14 of those companies also had negative net income during 2015 as well. This is what makes identifying target using the traditional method a big challenge in this sector. Technology obsolescence is major concern for the technology industry, disruptions are the norm in this business making things more challenging.

Investors ideally should have some idea about the major global trends that is shaping the industry such as the advancement of technology in terms of computing power and how they intertwine with business IT needs, bring your own device trends, redesigning of the entire computer eco-system (quantum computing) etc.,. PE and VC involvement in the sector suggests that there are still quite a huge quantum of early stage risk that is involved in this sector.  Lawsuits, in case of failure to protect cyber-attacks or failure to recover the lost data could result in huge losses to the tech firms which could run into millions of dollars.

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Financial Sector-Status quo to be punished</strong><br />
Although, the evolution is still pretty nascent, Fintech has the potential to revolutionize how financial services are delivered in the GCC, and around the world. While the fintech ecosystem in the Middle East is less developed than in other regions, it is expected to grow swiftly, aided and abetted by the young, tech-savvy demography in the region. In fact, most fintech products are aimed at capturing the &ldquo;millennials&rdquo; (The term Millennials is usually refers to individuals who reached adulthood around the turn of the 21st century, consisting of individuals born between the early 1980s and early 2000s) market, as they usually decide on the trends that stick. For instance, Commercial Bank of Dubai (CBD) launched &ldquo;CBD Now&rdquo;, Dubai&rsquo;s first digital-only bank, targeting millennials and digitally connected customers. GCC fintech companies now account for 7% of all fintech business in the MENA region, and are reaping the benefits of catering to the ever-connected millennials. These emerging technocrats aim to attract the attention of millennials, by providing convenient, easy-to-use, cost- & time-effective solutions that minimizes human interaction, and cuts through old-world problems, such as nepotism, red-tape and bureaucracy.<br />
<br />
Companies in the financial sector still rely on old legacy systems and deep rooted traditions, with apathetic customer service. These conditions make the industry particularly vulnerable for disruption, allowing software and technology to potentially play a large role in the delivery of more efficient services. The value propositions presented by these novel digital technologies threaten the status quo of the banks and financial institutions eco-system. According to Boston Consulting Group (BCG) over the next five years, corporate banks that remain digital laggards could see profits drop by as much as 15%-30% relative to their digitally fast-moving competitors.<br />
<br />
According to PWC, consumer banking and payments segment are most susceptible to the disruption caused by fintech, followed by insurance and asset management. Arrival of online insurance marketplaces is expected to lead to homogenization of risks and a complete overhaul of traditional channels of distribution. Fintech companies have now entered the remittance space, despite regulatory hassles, and are cutting out the middlemen (i.e.) the banks, thereby reducing costs for the remitter. With advancements in technology, advisory function will become more automated (eg. Robo-advisors), which will affect the margins of traditional financial services firms. Algorithm trading will also gain a significant boost, as FinTech will enable investors to build, test and execute trading algorithms, with limited technical knowledge.<br />
<br />
The success of various crowdfunding platforms have indicated the big gap that exists in the supply and demand of capital. While they may not replace the traditional sources of funding, such as banks, PEs and VCs, crowdfunding has provided another option for a region that is facing severe liquidity-crunch.<br />
<br />
<strong>Islamic Finance</strong><br />
As in conventional finance, Fintech&rsquo;s penetration into Islamic finance is still in its infancy with very few participants. However, the potential positive disruptions to traditional Islamic finance cannot be underestimated. From a consumer perspective, fintech provides more choices that suit individual needs at competitive cost and easier access, over the internet, mobile devices and social media. SMEs that find it hard to obtain bank funding from Islamic Financial Institutions (IFIs) could look to fintechs to fill that gap, via sharia-compliant P2P lending and crowd funding platforms. Lenders also enjoy higher returns by directly investing in businesses via an online platform, than through a third party.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Therefore, the biggest potential impacts of fintech on Islamic finance would be the increase in reach of Islamic financial services, as an alternative to conventional finance, especially in places, where it is yet to enter and the standardization of rules and regulations, which currently vary across borders. Fintech will have a positive impact on consumers of Islamic finance, while the current providers of sharia compliant products and offerings will have to adapt, or face obsolescence.<br />
<br />
<strong>Payment Solutions</strong><br />
At present, payment solutions account for approximately 40% of all financial technology (fintech) business in the GCC, followed by crowdfunding and P2P lending, and the region is poised to experience the most explosive growth, despite receiving the lowest funding.<br />
<br />
Supplementing the growth of fintech, blockchain technologies have the potential to revolutionize the rapidly growing financial services sector in the GCC, with multitude of applications, including retail payments infrastructure, remittances, trade finance and syndicated loans, capital markets, and compliance activities. A prominent application of the blockchain technology would be the move towards digital currency, unrestricted by national borders. Although the GCC has a mixed record in payment virtualization, developments in payments technology are paving the way to wider adoption of digital currencies, which would throw up new challenges in cross-border transactions, investment flows etc.<br />
<br />
<strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
The Fintech Companies can broadly be classified into two different types of namely the competitive and the collaborative. The competitive companies pose a direct challenge to the financial services institutions, on the contrary, the collaborative segment, offer solutions that complement the position of existing market players. The reason for the collaboration is because, the conventional players are finding it difficult to make the transition to digital, and are hamstrung by slower pace of response, which has led to skyrocketing interest in technology start-ups in the BFSI domain. The interest in fintech is driven both by conventional players and by new startups, with the former seeking to safeguard their interest against potential disruption, and the latter trying to reduce cost and improve customer convenience. Disruption of business models is a certainty, but traditional players may yet survive the fintech onslaught.</div>[:ar]<div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Financial Sector-Status quo to be punished</strong><br />

		<Title>[:en]These are the 3 areas AI will impact GCC[:ar]هذه هي المجالات الثلاث للذكاء الاصطناعي التي سوف تؤثر على دول مجلس التعاون الخليجي[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">Simply put, artificial intelligence is a sub-field of computer science. Its goal is to enable the development of computers that are able to do things normally done by people -- in particular, things associated with people acting intelligently. Even within the AI, there are strong AI, Weak AI and the somewhere in between AI. We are yet to see strong AI, AI that can think like a human being himself, in existence. Weak AI, These are AI that are adopted to perform a single function like playing chess or scrabble. AI falls somewhere between these two extremes, a middle path, is the where most of today&rsquo;s research is going on.<br />
<br />
Given the reach of disruptive potential and the reach of AI, it could arrive at GCC shores before long. We see three major areas in the GCC region in which AI could be used.<br />
<br />
<strong>Healthcare &ndash; AI Based Health Assistants </strong><br />
Similar to Siri or Google Now, AI based health assistants can be used for initial diagnosis of patients. These chat bots enquire user symptoms and provides easy-to-understand information about their medical conditions. It would also provide steps and measures to remedy the illness and could possibly even warn the users as to when to see their doctors. GCC region is predisposed to type-2 diabetes and it requires managing food intake and constant monitoring of patients. AI based health assistants could take care of patients by monitoring their food and medicine intake at regular intervals thereby removing uncertainty. Your.MD and Babylon Health are two London based startups that are currently developing such chatbots. Even Microsoft has developed one of its own called Microsoft Tay.<br />
<br />
<strong>Early Diagnosis</strong><br />
The treatment and prevention of rare and dangerous diseases often depends on detecting the symptoms at the right time. In many cases, early diagnosis can result in complete cure. Conversely, a late or wrong diagnosis, in case of cancer, can have damaging or potentially fatal results. AI networks can scan through millions of CT scans that have been uploaded to its server and compare that with the patient&rsquo;s one. It can help identify tumour and cross-check it with its database to check if it is a malignant one or a non-malignant one. GCC region is expected to have 150-200 percent increase in cancer rates by 2030 owing to changes in diet and lifestyle. This region is also expected to have considerable shortage in medical personnel as most of them come from other countries. While the prospects of AI replacing a trained radiologist, with decades of experience under his belt, is extremely unlikely, it can definitely serve as an ideal tool in helping him identify tumours and other illness with remarkable accuracy.<br />
<br />
<strong>Traffic Management and identifying violations</strong><br />
Two people die in accidents on a daily basis in the UAE everyday according to the latest information from country&rsquo;s Ministry of Interior. While the number of accidents in the UAE has come down from 4,796 in 2015 to 4,788 in 2016 the number of road death have increased by 7.4% during the same period. Rash and negligent driving has been a major cause of concern for the authorities. With the GCC countries trying to increase tourism revenue by attracting more tourists to the country incidences of rash or negligent driving could damage the country&rsquo;s reputation. AI could help in traffic management by simultaneously analysing data from various traffic junctions which in turn could be used to regulate traffic and manage traffic signals. In 2016, a pilot programme was conducted in Pittsburgh, USA by a company named &ldquo;Surtrac&rdquo;. In the limited tests, the startup was able to reduce. &nbsp;travel time by 25 percent and idling time by over 40 percent.<br />
<br />
<strong>Stock trading and increasing liquidity</strong><br />
GCC countries stock markets have the lowest liquidity in the world. Computer aided trading or algorithm based trading could help in improving the volumes of the stock market. To start with the region could look at algorithm based trading whereby the computers would take the decision to trade depending on pre-defined rules. This would improve liquidity and help the regional investors with easy entry/ exit from the market. Improvement in liquidity would also help the region in attracting international capital.<br />
<br />
Given the disruptive nature of AI, the application could possibly enter other fields as well. Areas such as air traffic control are for the most part automated and we could see AI extending its capabilities and completely taking over the operations of the ATC. Given the Middle East region&rsquo;s status as a transport hub, this could open up opportunities for tech firms in the region. Manufacturing is another area that could very well be disrupted by automation. We already have robots that possess the dexterity of human hands and these robots are trained by human workers who currently do the job. Manufacturing has never been GCC&rsquo;s forte mainly due to the size of Oil and gas sector and shortage of the available skill. Automated manufacturing could change all this and it would also go very well with the government&rsquo;s objective of diversifying the economy.<br />
<br />
GCC countries, the UAE in particular, has shown lot of interest in emerging technologies such as Block chain and Hyperloop. AI could very well turn out to be the next big interesting technology for the region. The healthcare needs of the people of the region and the higher fatality rate associated with them could very well be tackled with the help of AI. It could even help the GCC countries reduce the dependence on expat medical professionals. The GCC region is expected to witness two mega events &ndash; Dubai Expo 2020 and Qatar Fifa 2022- both of which are expected to bring in foreign visitors by the droves. Crowd control, temperature control (within stadia and exhibition centres), traffic management etc., needs constant monitoring and quick decisions. AI can very well shoulder most of its burden reducing the stress on authorities. Authorities in the region have tried to bring in foreign investors in order to prop-up the capital market&rsquo;s liquidity and to put them on the map of global investors. AI and Bot trading have started to gain popularity among investors now and they could be used to improve the popularity of GCC markets. In recent years, funds globally have moved towards real machine learning where artificially intelligent systems can analyse large amounts of data at speed and improve themselves through such analysis. Given the poor participation of institutional investors in these markets encouraging artificial trading could be a great way to boost the sagging liquidity in the region.</div>[:ar]<div style="text-align: justify;">Simply put, artificial intelligence is a sub-field of computer science.

In recent years, funds globally have moved towards real machine learning where artificially intelligent systems can analyse large amounts of data at speed and improve themselves through such analysis. Given the poor participation of institutional investors in these markets encouraging artificial trading could be a great way to boost the sagging liquidity in the region.</div>[:]]]></Content>

		<Title>[:en]Mobile payments are a great business opportunity for GCC banks[:ar]ُعد الدفع عبر الهاتف فرصة كبيرة لمصارف دول مجلس التعاون الخليجي[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">The article originally appeared in The National | Business <br />
<br />
Cash is still king in the GCC. But that is soon to change. The beauty of disruptive technology is it disrupts, no matter what. Either companies adapt quickly, or get swamped under.<br />
<br />
Consider the case of mobile payments.<br />
<br />
Sweden opened its first unmanned convenience store in March last year. Amazon is testing a grocery store in Seattle with no checkout lines. Customers check-in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed and when they are done shopping, they just walk out. Amazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep-learning technologies.<br />
<br />
After barter and money, plastic cards represented the third generation of payment systems. However, the world is already moving to the fourth-generation concept, viz mobile payments. It is surprising that the GCC enjoys one of the highest mobile penetration rates (about 175 subscriptions per 100 population) but is yet to embrace mobile payments, which account for a paltry 1.3 per cent of global transactions compared with about 37 per cent in Asia- Pacific.<br />
<br />
The GCC has a poor track record of adapting to the third-generation plastic card era, with only 25 per cent of its population using them (and frankly, the reasons for the region&rsquo;s adherence to cash are not entirely clear). However, here is a great opportunity to leapfrog into the fourth generation of payment systems, with some help.<br />
<br />
Combine a tech-savvy youth demography with very high mobile penetration, and this leap to the fourth generation, mobile payment system is just waiting to happen in the GCC. In a study commissioned by Cards and Payments Middle East, 77 per cent of people polled said they needed more convenience and less hassle in their transactions. That opens up a US$3 billion market in the UAE alone by next year, according to Research Moz. But who will capitalise on this opportunity?<br />
<br />
Banks are the usual suspects, but they run the risk of viewing this as another add-on service and may miss the trend completely. The GCC banks have so far demonstrated a lackadaisical attitude about embracing digital banking and are now under considerable pressure to innovate digital services. The dent the global financial crisis had on their balance sheets kept them busy restructuring and cleaning up, leaving little time to focus on technology investments.<br />
<br />
Banks that beat this trend and focus on digital technology can create huge shareholder value. Some banks are offering digital wallets powered by MasterPass, which was launched by MasterCard, and lets smartphones store credit and debit card information in digital form, enabling users to make purchases with their phone instead of a card.<br />
<br />
However, a delay on their part will enable non-bank players to swiftly move in and capture the market. The substantial success of the UAE-based Beam Wallet is a case in point. While this competition between banks and non-banks plays out, regulators will also catch up with the trend. The Central Bank of the UAE has already approved mobile wallets and it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before other central banks recognize this trend and introduce norms for orderly growth.<br />
<br />
The rapidly evolving mobile payment architecture will affect key stakeholders such as service providers (credit card companies and banks, for example), retailers, customers and regulators. Among them, customers are the most ready and will drive the change while others will catch up. Who knows, in about three years you might be able to forget your wallet at home &ndash; but not your smartphone</div>[:ar]<div style="text-align: justify;">The article originally appeared in The National | Business.<br />

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]Recently I unearthed two interesting but opposite views on Amazon:
<ol>
 	<li><a href="http://www.vox.com/new-money/2016/12/28/13889840/amazon-innovation-google-apple">Amazon is a great company and is poised for more success as success begets success</a></li>

</ol>
Since I am an eternal optimist let’s take the first “premise”
<div style="text-align: justify;">

<strong>Amazon is a great company it is poised for more success, as success begets success.</strong>
Since its IPO in 1997 Amazon’s share price increased by an astounding 45,965% or a CAGR of 36%. In other words, a hundred dollar invested in 1997 is worth USD 46,064. Although the net income was mostly negative across the years Amazon, must have been doing something right to command such returns.

“The everything store” as Amazon likes to call itself started as an online bookshop that transformed into a Media, IT and retail giant and it’s all thanks to Jeff Bezoz’s  audacious and relentless dream  along with his team to create a multinational brand that has customer service and customer satisfaction at its heart.

Now let’s list the things that have worked for Amazon.
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
 	<li>Today  Amazon is the leader in the E-book market  thanks to Kindle, Amazon raked in USD 12bn from Kindle alone</li>
 	<li>Amazon prime subscription is building strong brand loyalty. Services such as free delivery and 1 hour delivery have boosted subscribers. Based on the letter to shareholders Prime Members increased 51%.  Member in prime are in the 10s of million across the world according to Amazon data</li>
 	<li>Amazon is opening online stores in Key markets such as India; the sheer population alone and its position in Asia will drive amazon’s growth for years to come.</li>
 	<li>Amazon Web Service (AWS) continues to gain traction and analysts are estimating that AWS alone is worth USD 160 bn and growing.</li>
 	<li>Echo is a new innovation that could be the center piece of the internet of things revolution, Amazon did not release actual numbers however they announced that in 2016 echo sales were 9x last year’s sale. If echo managed to position itself as a centerpiece conducive to the internet of things, Amazon will capitalize on a relatively new market.</li>
 	<li>Human resources and management skills, despite being a behemoth Amazon prides itself  as being run as a startup, the teams are usually small and they are free to experiment new ideas while other tech giants tend to acquire  startups and try to integrate the startup in its own work environment thus  usually leading to atrophy and failure.</li>
 	<li>As mentioned earlier research and development is the cornerstone of Amazon’s growth. In 2015, USD 12.5 bn was spent on research and development while revenues for the year reached USD 107 Bn that’s more than the GDP of Morocco</li>
</ol>
<strong>Amazon’s numbers are inflated, its over-valued and it’s time to jump ship</strong>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
 	<li>Amazon Stock is overvalued,  The P/E ratio is around 183, while the P/E  ratio of S&P technology sector is at 22.2x and the S&P 500 P/E ratio is hovering around 20.8x. At around 183x investors are expecting that the bottom line will increase by 183% each year for the foreseeable future. looking back from 2012-2013 Amazon posted a negative net income in 2012 then positive in 2013 then back to negative in 2014 before posting USD 596 mn in profits in 2016</li>
 	<li>The share price grew at 36% annually since 1997. If this pace continues, Amazon’s market value will have to exceed USD 5 trillion by 2025 since the inception of S&P 500 and the Dow Jones index no company exceeded the USD 1 Trillion mark. Just to keep the number USD 5 trillion in context the 4<sup>th</sup> largest country in the world in terms of GDP (Germany) has a GDP of around USD 3.5 trillion.</li>
 	<li>Amazon is a volatile stock  16 out  of the 20 years Amazon managed to produce a double digit draw down ( Stock decline post a new high) not  a large proportion of investors will be able to go to sleep at night with that kind of odds</li>
 	<li>Amazon’s share growth is a black swan event, trying  this kind of growth will deplete your portfolio in the long term. Even if you managed to find it, it will be a rare event for you to captured the whole 38,115% return, as, once the stock doubles or triples or even increase 10x you are more likely to book profits than wait!</li>
</ol>
Having a balanced view between the pros and the cons is one of the best ways to make an informed decision, that said regardless of my views on Amazon as an investment. I raise my hat to the commendable growth story of Amazon . In 1995 Amazon posted USD 511,000 in revenues 20 years later Revenues of Amazon reached USD 107 bn a growth rate of 195,000 times or an annual growth of 83%.  That said investors need to do their due diligence and research companies thoroughly, yes,  in hindsight an investment in amazon would have been the mother of all investments( if you invested near the start and sold today)  and would have been the golden ticket to financial security, however, one must remember that for every amazon there are thousands of busted companies and just to cite some examples  in efforts to ground you back to reality.
<ol>
 	<li>Webvan an online grocery delivery  was valued at USD 1.2 billion in 1999 the company  failed and closed shop in 2001</li>
 	<li>Etoys.com retailer was the most visited site for holiday shopping, in 1999 it hit an all-time high of $84 16 months later the stock  flopped and was deemed worthless</li>
 	<li>Blockbuster a home movie and game rental giant was worth $ 5 bn failing to innovate turned this success story from the front seats to bankruptcy court.</li>
 	<li>Geo cities a web hosting service had 19 mn unique visitors per month. In 1998, Yahoo purchased the company  for USD 3.6 bn in 1999 one year later  Geo cities ‘was no more’</li>
</ol>
The list goes on and branches into all business sectors, but since we were discussing technology stock we only mentioned tech flops or companies that flopped due to new technology. Investors that have booked some profits on Amazon can ride the bull, however, late comers beware.

		<Title>[:en]Sharia Gold Standard - A new Opportunity?[:ar]هل معيار الشريعة الذهبي - فرصة جديدة؟[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">

Strict norms have hindered the development of gold related investable products in the Islamic finance world and restricted the investment only in the form of bullion and jewelry. A few gold related Islamic investment products which supported investors to buy and sell precious metals in a bulk form at competitive rates while, managing the supply chain to ensure secure vaulting existed prior to the introduction of the Gold Standard. However, lack of understanding and harmony of Sharia law with regards to gold product offerings kept investors away from these investments.

According to Islamic tradition, gold is one of the six “ribawi*” items, along with silver, dates, wheat, salt and barley and is subject to the Sharia rulings for currency exchange (al-Sarf). And hence, very stringent rules apply to the transactions involving these items to ensure that the transactions remained riba-free. Contrary to traditional paper based precious metals contracts that are traded on exchanges worldwide, Sharia law compels that constructive possession be taken for both gold and silver. This creates a unique problem for clients that of being able to store their gold or silver bullions securely until the time comes to exit. Alongside being unable to access precious metals in a bulk form, the storage conundrum has prevented Sharia conscious clients from trading in precious metals. Additionally, financial assets (such as sukuk, mutual funds, ETFs), which are wholly backed by physical gold are to be construed as gold and therefore, must be dealt with in accordance with the Sharia principles governing the dealings in gold.

Since gold is fungible, Sharia also mandates both segregation and allocation for the establishment of definitive ownership of physical gold. Ownership of physical gold requires the actual segregation of that gold from all other gold holdings stored at the same location. The Sharia requires this segregation to establish the precise loss and liabilities of a particular owner of the gold in case of the partial damage to the place where all the gold is kept. However, in case of non-segregation of gold, the gold owners are required to share risks proportionate to their ownership in the holding.

The new AAOIFI gold standard opens up the following avenues:

</div>
<ol>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">It is permissible to buy the shares of a Gold mining company provided that the transaction complies with the AAOIFI’s standard 21 (Financial Paper – Shares and Bonds)</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Gold Savings Schemes: Provided the savings schemes comply with the rules related to payment and possession.</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">ETFs and Gold Certificates:  Provided these instruments are backed by real gold and constructive possession is realized by allocation of gold or by holding a certificate that represents ownership of a specified gold that is distinguishable from others, by serial numbers or other distinct marks. Moreover, the certificate is issued the day the contract is concluded [Trade Date “T+0”].  However, it restricts the sale of unspecified gold without physical possession. According to the standard, possession of a gold certificate is as good as the constructive possession, provided the gold certificate is as good as taking physical possession of the gold in terms of legal effect, transfer of risk and benefits.</li>
</ol>
<div style="text-align: justify;">With the growth of Islamic financial services, the need for harmonized understanding on use of gold by the financial institutions was imperative. AAOIFI has addressed this concern with its new gold standard, which would harmonize practice across borders and has addressed issues including collateral, set-off, screening and the exchange of gold in spot and deferred transactions. This standard is expected to have a considerable constructive impact as it addresses several issues covering current applications and crucial Islamic jurisprudence developments in relation to the product, its application by financial institutions and the investors.

		<Title>[:en]Regulations governing liquidity risk in Islamic Banking[:ar]Regulations governing liquidity risk in Islamic Banking[:]</Title>
		<Content>[:en]This article was first published in Islamic Finance news Volume 16 Issue 48 dated the 4th December 2019

Given the systemic importance and the pivotal role played by banks in a country’s economy, banking regulations are of paramount importance for all stakeholders. Guidelines and regulations enable all banks to maintain stability and monitor their risk. In the context of Islamic Banking, liquidity risk is challenging because of limited availability of Shariah compliant short term liquidity instruments and a shallow markets for these instruments.

While the implementation of regulations is left to each country’s Central Bank, Islamic Financial Stability (IFSB) has set out guidelines, CPIFR (Core Principles for Islamic Finance Regulation), for various aspects of Islamic Banking including liquidity risk. IFSB has endorsed Basel III guidelines and has set out Shariah compliance guidance as required. These serve as references to countries’ regulatory bodies when they set their own regulations. International Monetary Fund (IMF) also goes by these guidelines while assessing the stability of Islamic banks. These guidelines include quantitative ratios and qualitative principles.

CPIFR contains 23 guiding principles for liquidity risk management. The guidelines range from identifying all sources of liquidity risks, modelling behavioural profiles of fund providers to issuance of more Shariah compliant short term instrument and provision of Shariah compliant deposit insurance. Quantitative aspects cover Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) that are to be maintained by the banks to monitor liquidity risk. Both these ratios have to be equal to or greater than 100%.The timeline for implementation is same as that stated in Basel III – LCR could be implemented in phases starting at 60% in 2015 and reaching 100% in January of 2019 and NSFR to be implemented from 1st January 2018.

LCR and NSFR of countries like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar are well above the prescribed threshold of 100%. UAE has taken up a phased implementation of these guidelines, where it approves banks on a case to case basis to follow these metrics. It currently uses the Eligible Liquid Assets Ratio (ELAR) as the liquidity risk measure and has prescribed banks to maintain it above 10% (UAE Central Bank Liquidity Regulation 2015). As of December 2018, according to UAE Central Bank data, Islamic banks are comfortably above the benchmark. Bangladesh has implemented these ratios and the values are above 100% as required. LCR of Malaysian banks are above the threshold of 100%. NFSR was in observation period since January 2018 and its implementation has been mandated from 1st July 2020.

Despite IFSB issuing guidelines in 2015, many countries are yet to incorporate these regulations or are currently implementing it in phases. Wider implementation and adherence would enhance soundness of Islamic Banks, especially at a stage when Islamic Banking has been exhibiting growth.[:ar]This article was first published in Islamic Finance news Volume 16 Issue 48 dated the 4th December 2019

While the implementation of regulations is left to each country’s Central Bank, Islamic Financial Stability (IFSB) has set out guidelines, CPIFR (Core Principles for Islamic Finance Regulation), for various aspects of Islamic Banking including liquidity risk. IFSB has endorsed Basel III guidelines and has set out Shariah compliance guidance as required. These serve as references to countries’ regulatory bodies when they set their own regulations. International Monetary Fund (IMF) also goes by these guidelines while assessing the stability of Islamic banks. These guidelines include quantitative ratios and qualitative principles.

CPIFR contains 23 guiding principles for liquidity risk management. The guidelines range from identifying all sources of liquidity risks, modelling behavioural profiles of fund providers to issuance of more Shariah compliant short term instrument and provision of Shariah compliant deposit insurance. Quantitative aspects cover Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) that are to be maintained by the banks to monitor liquidity risk. Both these ratios have to be equal to or greater than 100%.The timeline for implementation is same as that stated in Basel III – LCR could be implemented in phases starting at 60% in 2015 and reaching 100% in January of 2019 and NSFR to be implemented from 1st January 2018.

LCR and NSFR of countries like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar are well above the prescribed threshold of 100%. UAE has taken up a phased implementation of these guidelines, where it approves banks on a case to case basis to follow these metrics. It currently uses the Eligible Liquid Assets Ratio (ELAR) as the liquidity risk measure and has prescribed banks to maintain it above 10% (UAE Central Bank Liquidity Regulation 2015). As of December 2018, according to UAE Central Bank data, Islamic banks are comfortably above the benchmark. Bangladesh has implemented these ratios and the values are above 100% as required. LCR of Malaysian banks are above the threshold of 100%. NFSR was in observation period since January 2018 and its implementation has been mandated from 1st July 2020.

Despite IFSB issuing guidelines in 2015, many countries are yet to incorporate these regulations or are currently implementing it in phases. Wider implementation and adherence would enhance soundness of Islamic Banks, especially at a stage when Islamic Banking has been exhibiting growth.[:]</Content>

<strong>Sizable issuances</strong>
The emergence of GCC bond markets have been a fallout of the low oil prices and decline in foreign reserves, which has forced the regional governments to look for alternative routes to fund their diversification plans. Recently, debt issuances has been an important avenue for fund raising activities of the government. Out of the USD 38.5Bn that has been raised in the Middle East region since the beginning of 2017, 61% has come from the GCC countries. Saudi Arabia has raised close to USD 9Bn in 2017, while Kuwait, Oman and Bahrain came out with bond issuances close to USD 8Bn, USD 7Bn and USD 1.6Bn respectively(CBonds). In 2016 alone, the GCC region raised close to USD 71Bn. Favourable financing conditions and significant investor demand encouraged a rebound in bond issuance throughout the MENA region, and particularly in GCC countries. This could be inferred from the fact that most of the government and commercial issuances from the region have been oversubscribed consistently. Oman’s recently issued USD 5Bn bond issuances was oversubscribed by almost four times (NBAD).

<strong>Rising investor interest </strong>
GCC region has found quite a bit of interest from the Asian investment community mainly owing to the low interest rate environment prevailing in the developed economies. This new sprouted interest for GCC issues from Asian investors has been due to the familiarity of GCC markets.  Asian investors have become better attuned to GCC credit and their institutional knowledge has grown considerably; roadshows conducted by GCC countries in major Asian financial hotspots like Hong Kong and Singapore have received brisk investor interest. The strengthening of US currency has also led lot of investors to choose dollar denominated bonds. Close to USD 9Bn of bonds issued in the USD dollar denomination were subscribed by Asian investors during 2016, twice the amount of funds that were placed in 2015 (<a href="https://www.thenational.ae/business/markets/gcc-debt-draws-asian-investors-1.76056">The National</a>).

<strong>High credit rating and better yields</strong>
GCC countries offering local currency issuances have also increased in the recent years; Korean won-denominated paper leads Asian currency sector lately, with a 43% share (USD 1.3 billion equivalent) of such paper issued since 2015. The offshore Chinese renminbi market is also a good indicator of the increasing interest for GCC companies to issue local currency bonds, currently equivalent to USD 796 million. The local currency issuances of GCC papers/ bonds grew by more than 25 percent in the year 2016. Year to date, it is seven times that of the same-period volumes last year.

GCC nations for their part offer better yields than other developing economies of similar credit rating. For example, Kuwait and Abu Dhabi’s ten-year sovereign bonds have Yield to Maturity (YTM) that is higher by 20 and 45 basis points respectively compared to South Korean government bonds (NBAD).  Similarly, Qatar’s ten-year bonds which is rated as AA- yields almost as much as China’s ten year bonds despite the fact that latter’s rating being one level below at A+. Attractive yields and relatively safe economies make it even more appealing from an investor point of view.  The GCC region currently offer a mix of credit ratings – Abu Dhabi and Kuwait have the highest AA rating while Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Dubai and Oman have ratings that range from AA- to BBB- providing investors with wide investment opportunity.

<strong>Outlook for bond issuances in the region</strong>
Funding requirement in the region by sovereigns and corporates is on the rise and bank liquidity is not enough to absorb the entire demand. Moreover, as the countries look for diversification of the economy there is impetus on growth. In addition to the sovereign issues, there is ample scope for private company issuances in the region that will offer higher yields. Spending by corporates on M&A and investment projects will grow and have a direct impact on fixed income issuances. From 2007 alone, there has been 225 corporate issues that has hit the GCC market with more than half of that (137 issues) coming up after 2013.  There has been 17 companies that have come up with bond issuances in 2017 double the number of companies that issued bonds in 2016.

GCC region has been trying to harmonize the regional banks’ capital requirements to be in line with BASEL – III. In 2016 alone the size of the bonds issued by banks in the region increased by 36% to USD 11.7Bn. This trend is expected to continue in the near future. One advantage that GCC banks have is that they have been relatively conservative in their business and operational strategy, as a result they have strong balance sheets which is expected to be positive for such issuances. Basel III implications for liquidity are fairly significant in GCC countries as banks have a substantial contractual maturity mismatch between medium-term lending and very short-term customer deposits. Some banks have started to issue longer-tenor debt to reduce this mismatch, but this remains limited (Fitch Ratings).

Still near zero interest rates have made investors (not only in Asia, but also in US and Europe, where interest rates are low) willing to increase their exposure to GCC sovereigns and banks. They are gradually becoming cognizant of the high quality papers available in the GCC region, and the interest is set to continue for good part of 2017. GCC nations have also reached out to investors in the Asian market by offering issuances in Asian bond markets. Formosa market in Taiwan is a notable example of quality bank issuances released abroad; QNB raised USD 625 Mn in 2016 and both NBAD (USD 1.5Bn) and ADCB (USD 230Mn) have followed suit this year. GCC banks have also tapped the international syndicated loan market to refinance maturing debt and are expected to continue to raise money throughout the year. In the current environment, GCC region remains the sole bright spot that promises to give higher yields with relative stability.

		<Title>[:en]GCC Petrochemical Industry: Move beyond cheap feedstock[:ar]صناعة البتروكيماويات الخليجية: تتجاوز المواد الخام الرخيصة[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">

The main source of current GCC feedstock is ethane which, along with methane, is naturally found in associated gas. Other significant feedstocks includes propane and butane, both of which are derived from LPG. Lastly, there is naphtha, which is a product of crude oil refining. In contrast it is important to highlight that Naphtha’s contribution in Global feedstock consumption is around 70% in the year 2015, according to Platts.

<img src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GCC_Petrochemical_Industry_Marmore_Blog_Fig1.jpg" alt="Figure 1: GCC Petrochemical Feedstock Consumption 2016" />

GCC has a significant cost advantage in feedstocks as compared to US and Europe wherein Ethane and Naphtha are the major feedstocks used to produce petrochemicals. Ethylene is the most produced and consumed petrochemicals globally. Cheap availability of Ethane also provides high margin when compared with the price of Ethylene.

Ethylene and its derivatives are the most widely used products in the global chemical industry. GCC petrochemicals mainly use ethane to produce ethylene, whereas other regions, such as Europe and Asia, rely on crude-oil derived naphtha. The generally lower cost of ethane versus crude oil has lent a historical cost advantage to GCC particularly during the period of elevated oil prices.

<img src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GCC_Petrochemical_Industry_Marmore_Blog_Fig2.jpg" alt="Figure 2: Cash cost for production of Ethylene ($/ton)" />

Due to the availability of cheap feedstock, GCC petrochemicals companies have achieved significantly higher margin as compared to Global Players. However recently due to constraints on availability of cheap feedstock on account of depleting resources and demand from other industries, profit margins have started to decline over the years. Whereas global competitors have seen slow but steady growth in both Operating and Net profit margins as a result of availability of new cheaper sources of feedstock.

<img src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GCC_Petrochemical_Industry_Marmore_Blog_Fig3.jpg" alt="Table 1: Net Profit Margins for Petrochemical companies" />

Petrochemical producers in the GCC are currently at the juncture where several trends could significantly affect their industry. Multiple market disruptions—including the shale gas discovery in the United States, low oil prices worldwide, and a capacity expansion drive in China and Iran are reshaping the petrochemical industry. These disruptions are shifting the balance of power among major regional players and expose many Middle Eastern producers to the risk of losing competitive edge which they have long enjoyed from cheap feedstock. In addition, GCC is also experiencing a regional shortage of natural gas, due to supply–demand imbalances.

Regardless of their negligible impact in the short term, these new feedstock sources in US, China, and Iraq can present threats to the profitability of GCC players in the long run. The shifts in the cost curve could lead to more competitively priced feedstocks and new petrochemical capacity in all three markets: the U.S., China, and Iraq. Capacity additions from these sources could ultimately result in excess supply, and new feedstocks will likely replace older sources pushing traditional players out of the market. At a time when gas prices within the GCC are likely to rise, GCC will have to explore alternative growth strategies to conventional cheap feedstock in order to remain globally competitive.

In order to ensure growth of the petrochemical sector, as it faces an ethane supply crunch, other feedstocks are required to be increasingly brought into the mix, the most prominent being naphtha. Although more costly than ethane, when naphtha is processed (cracked) it yields both olefins and aromatics (both are basic chemicals which are used to produce other more refined chemical products), whereas ethane yields mainly the former. Naphtha crackers are more efficient and the output produced is of higher quality. Although the higher cost of cracking naphtha vis-à-vis ethane had discouraged its use previously, with an ethane shortage looming, naphtha’s use has become increasingly viable. As a result of the higher use of naphtha, the GCC will see total aromatics output rising by 2020. This new value chain of chemical products will open up a downstream manufacturing and conversion industry.

Alternatively, GCC producers can opt for joint ventures to set up projects in the U.S., China, and Iraq. They can also expand into performance or specialty products, or consolidate the industry and build scale. Each of these options entails building on existing capabilities—or implementing capabilities that are new to the enterprise. Industry leaders in the Middle East are of the opinion that integration with refineries and downstream consumers has become increasingly crucial not only for establishing a higher value adding manufacturing base, but also for pushing the GCC’s non-oil exports.

To achieve a sustainable competitive advantage in the future, companies in the region must also develop capabilities aimed at strengthening their commercial, operational, and innovation prowess. Capability building takes time; however, petrochemical companies in the region should embark on their transformation journey now.

In order to ensure growth of the petrochemical sector, as it faces an ethane supply crunch, other feedstocks are required to be increasingly brought into the mix, the most prominent being naphtha. Although more costly than ethane, when naphtha is processed (cracked) it yields both olefins and aromatics (both are basic chemicals which are used to produce other more refined chemical products), whereas ethane yields mainly the former. Naphtha crackers are more efficient and the output produced is of higher quality. Although the higher cost of cracking naphtha vis-à-vis ethane had discouraged its use previously, with an ethane shortage looming, naphtha’s use has become increasingly viable. As a result of the higher use of naphtha, the GCC will see total aromatics output rising by 2020. This new value chain of chemical products will open up a downstream manufacturing and conversion industry.

Alternatively, GCC producers can opt for joint ventures to set up projects in the U.S., China, and Iraq. They can also expand into performance or specialty products, or consolidate the industry and build scale. Each of these options entails building on existing capabilities—or implementing capabilities that are new to the enterprise. Industry leaders in the Middle East are of the opinion that integration with refineries and downstream consumers has become increasingly crucial not only for establishing a higher value adding manufacturing base, but also for pushing the GCC’s non-oil exports.

To achieve a sustainable competitive advantage in the future, companies in the region must also develop capabilities aimed at strengthening their commercial, operational, and innovation prowess. Capability building takes time; however, petrochemical companies in the region should embark on their transformation journey now.

		<Title>[:en]Consolidation among UAE brokerages is the need of the hour[:ar]يعتبر الدمج بين شركات السمسرة الإماراتية هو المطلب في الوقت الحالي[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">

The article originally appeared in The National | Business.

Some sectors are more stressed than others and the brokerage sector in the UAE is one of them. Just as the UAE is overbanked, it is also overbrokered.

Built on soaring volumes and value traded before the global financial crisis, the industry was aided by heavy retail participation mostly trading for speculative purpose than investing reasons. Lack of investor sophistication meant more volume and value traded and, hence, juicy commissions. No wonder more than 100 players were attracted to set up in what was thought to be a super growth industry. The narrative has changed completely now thanks to the global financial crisis and low oil prices.

Despite its recent rally, the price of a barrel of Brent crude, at US$55.25 yesterday afternoon, is still more than half its peaks of mid-2014. And the Dubai Financial Market General Index is about 43 per cent below its peak level in 2008.

UAE stock-trading value peaked at US$150 billion in 2007. From that peak, the industry fell to a low point of $15bn in 2011 and was about $50bn last year. Of course, the industry got a boost in 2013-14 thanks to the inclusion of the UAE in the MSCI Emerging Market Index, opening doors for foreign investment interest.

Imagine a market size as small as $15bn in value traded to be shared by more than 100 players. That obviously leaves very little on the table. As the pie size decreases, the money one company can make also dwindles. Since this is a service industry requiring high level of human capital, fixed-cost factor will make the business model quickly unviable if we witness such contraction in value traded.

As a consequence, the number of players halved to 49 last year. Despite this contraction, the sector still looks overbrokered.

According to a recent study by Marmore, the consultancy where I am managing director, the industry will experience a value traded of about $112bn by 2020, a level at which more players will close shop. From a revenue point of view, the brokerage sector is estimated to have earned about $155 million last year and this is now expected to reach about $336m by 2020, according to our study. Given the anaemic growth in revenue, the fixed-cost intensive nature of the industry will drive more players to seek consolidation.

The case for consolidation is also strong for reasons beyond liquidity.

All GCC stock markets, including those in the UAE, have low institutional participation. Attracting institutional investors – domestic and foreign – requires market mechanisms on par with other developing and developed markets, including corporate governance and transparency. Institutional investors also look for greater and deeper research coverage on companies, a key service provided by sell-side brokers. Only about 30 per cent of stocks listed in the UAE are covered by analyst research. The dearth of avenues to hedge risk through derivatives and low product diversity also discourages investors.

Brokers who would want to successfully navigate in this environment should seek to attract institutional investors through roadshows and research capabilities. They must use technology to deliver services. They must lobby with regulators to introduce hedging instruments. They need size to do all of this and, hence, consolidation after all is not a bad idea in this scenario.

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">

The article originally appeared in Wealth Monitor.

The housing market in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) continues to face the crisis of supply shortage and ever-increasing demand. High population growth and rising per capita income fuelled the growth of demand for residential units over the past decade. With the population expected to reach 35mn in 2020 from 31mn in 2014, and average household size estimated to reduce from 5.6 to 5.28 as per current declining trends, aggregate demand for housing units is forecasted to be 1.6mn units over 2015-20. As of 2015, less than half of the population of KSA were homeowners compared to 64% for the U.S. which has a similar per capita income.

Affordability and access to mortgage finance are the key barriers to home ownership. Lack of regulations on foreclosures and absence of securitization of housing loans has increased cost of financing and thereby, making it unaffordable for the majority of medium-income households.

Only 2% of all home purchases in the Kingdom are financed through mortgages compared to 17% in the U.A.E and 70% in the U.K. Currently majority of mortgages are provided by Real Estate Development Fund (REDF).

In order to meet the rising demand for housing, affordable mortgage financing must be made available to the currently underserved middle market segment. Taking into account the growing demand and subsequent impact on house prices, providing affordable housing will be a considerable challenge for the KSA Government. The mortgage financing activity was carried out mostly by the 14 banks and five licensed real estate finance companies. In addition to the existing finance companies, in December 2015, Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) granted mortgage finance license to Bidaya Home Finance. Additionally, the Ministry of Finance for similar purpose has established the Real Estate Development Fund (REDF).

<strong>Bank Lending</strong>
<img title="Retail and Corporate Real Estate Lending (USD MN)" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Saudi_Mortgage_fig1_1.jpg" alt="Retail and Corporate Real Estate Lending (USD MN)" />

The total loan extended by banks to real estate segment which includes retail and corporate lending was at USD 14.5bn at the end of 2009.  However, it grew at a CAGR of 23% during the 2009-2015 period to reach USD 50.3bn. The retail lending grew at a CAGR of 24% compared to corporate lending which grew at a CAGR of 22% during the same 2009-2015 periods. The retail real estate lending which grew at the Y-o-Y rate of 17% and 28% in 2010 and 2011, with the introduction of mortgage law in 2012 witnessed a sharp increase of 31% in 2013 and 34% in 2014. The demand for mortgage loans triggered by reasons such as housing demand and supporting mortgage law was expected to increase at the higher rates in the coming years. However, the growth rate lost momentum primarily due to the affordability factor.

<strong>REDF Lending</strong>
The REDF is the largest Specialized Credit Institution (SCI) and provides personal and investment loans for housing development. Given the shortage of housing stock in Saudi Arabia, real estate development has been receiving significant attention from the Government. This included USD 67bn allocation by the Saudi King in 2011 to build housing units (not yet utilized) and the use of REDF loans as down-payment to meet the 70% LTV requirement for mortgages that was introduced in 2014. Real estate lending has increased significantly in recent years, with the outstanding volume at end-2015 reaching USD 40bn for REDF (compared to USD 21bn in 2011) and USD 50bn (compared to 19 billion) for banks.

<img title="REDF Disbursement, Repayment & Net Lending (USD Mn)" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Saudi_Mortgage_fig2.jpg" alt="REDF Disbursement, Repayment & Net Lending (USD Mn)" />

Despite the existence of REDF from 1974, the disbursement of funds by REDF have been very sluggish. Until recently the waiting list for an REDF housing loan was estimated at a staggering 18 years.  Between 1987 and 2010 the total disbursement by REDF was USD 20bn. Taking into account the repayment, the net lending by REF during the same period was approximately USD 2bn. However, in 2011, the government unveiled a plan to build 500,000 homes, allocating large amounts of state funds. Progress has been slow, partly because of ownership rights over land. However, subsequently the REDF became more active with increasing loan disbursements. Between 2011 & 2015, REDF disbursed real estate loans worth USD 26.7bn and the net lending during the same period stood at USD 21bn.

<strong>Mortgage Loans Outstanding – Outlook</strong>
As per Marmore’s report on the Saudi Mortgage Industry, starting from 2015, the mortgage loans is expected to grow at a CAGR of 24%. The Housing Ministry is anticipating the bank’s mortgage loan book to increase by USD 5bn to 8 bn a year till 2020, and, has set in motion several initiatives such as reduction of down payment required by mortgage seekers to 15%, introduction of white land tax. However, given the liquidity tightening in the banking sector and economic slow-down due to drop in oil revenue it is likely to impact the mortgage sector’s performance on the whole.

Over the coming years the REDF lending is also expected to continue to increase to reach USD 73bn by 2020 as against USD 40bn at the end of 2015. REDF was allocated USD 67bn billion in 2011 to be spent on half a million new houses. As a result there has been a significant increase in roll-out of loans by REDF in the recent years and it is expected to continue in the coming years. REDF disbursed loans worth USD 7.4bn in 2015, and loans worth an average of USD 8bn is expected to be issued by REDF on yearly basis. Apart from the capital boost received from the government, the growing interest in issuing Islamic bonds and securitizing the portfolio of the REDF loans can substantially increase the liquidity position of the fund and assist in rolling out more mortgage loans.

Inititives such as the Housing Ministry’s plan to create its own development company and start a mortgage-guarantee fund is expected to encourage banks to increase lending. Moreover, starting a state-owned mortgage firm similar to the U.S.’s Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to develop the secondary market for the mortgage industry would go a long way to boost liquidity.  In November 2015, Saudi Arabia approved proposals for a 2.5% ‘white land tax’, which will apply to undeveloped residential and residential/commercial plots within urban boundaries. The implementation of this new tax in late 2016 is expected to culminate into several benefits. In simple terms it is expected to increase the real estate development activity and simultaneously resulting in reducing further appreciation of land values. Additionally, the Government may opt to allocate the supplemental revenue for the development of affordable housing. Once the new tax law comes in effect, this could result in increased partnership between developers and land owners to develop their land banks. The law could also stimulate further development to address the severe shortage of middle income housing across the Kingdom.

Dubai markets have 49% restriction on the ownership for REITs while in many advanced countries 100% foreign ownership is allowed.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Islamic REITs can be a popular investment option for traditional investors who wish to invest in Sharia complaint products in assets other than equities such as real estate. However, GCC countries do not have any clear regulations in place for Islamic REITs and their listing. Countries such as Malaysia and Singapore have enlisted regulations for Islamic REITs due to which two UAE companies are expected to list their REITs in Malaysia worth RM 2 billion (USD 0.49 Bn) (Lancaster University).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Tax benefits for investors is found to be the major advantage of investing in REITs as dividends are not taxed. This advantage does not add much value to the GCC investors.<br />

Emirates REIT is the only listed REIT in GCC. It manages 1.8 million sq.ft leasable area with a portfolio of 8 properties. Its occupancy rate has been 77%, quite lower compared to the occupancy rates in the US that are mostly above 85%. Portfolio market value of Emirates REITs is AED 2.5 Bn (USD 0.68 Bn).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In Bahrain, Inovest REIT was launched in 2009 and got listed in the Bahrain bourse in 2015. Delays in implementation of regulations and approvals for the REITs are challenges in GCC countries including Bahrain. Inovest raised funds worth USD 79.5 mn for the iREIT with the main aim of purchasing income generating properties within GCC region.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Al Mehrab Tower REIT is the first sharia complaint REIT established in 2007 in Kuwait and was formed by Munshaat Real Estate Projects Co. K.S.C.C. Kuwait was the first GCC country to launch an Islamic REIT, though it is not listed in the stock exchange. Al Mehrab REIT was worth USD 100 bn in 2013 and was estimated to have generated an Internal Rate of return (IRR) of 24% during the same time.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Where is the opportunity for REITs in GCC?</strong><br />
The recovery of the real estate market in most of GCC countries, especially UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait after the Global financial crisis in 2008 is attracting investors again to invest in asset classes such as REITs. The new segment of affluent investors who wish to generate higher income from diversified income sources would prefer liquid investments such as REITs().<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Islamic REITs are one type of investment that capital market authorities in GCC can focus to develop regulations and popularize it with cues and studies from countries such as Malaysia and Singapore. With huge appetite for Islamic investment products within the GCC region, affluent and HNW investors as well as Government owned entities such as pension funds, investment funds and sovereign wealth funds might invest in such REITs to diversify their portfolio. If Islamic REITs are popularized and listed in GCC exchanges, institutional investors such as takaful companies might also invest in these products.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
GCC region is a place of attraction with large scale and world class malls such as the Dubai Mall in UAE, The Grand Avenues in Kuwait and many more across the region. Most of these malls are developed by real estate players or holding companies who rent or lease out commercial space to the retailers. Their income is generated in the form of rent or lease. With major events such as the World Expo 2020 and Qatar World cup 2022 lined up, activity in malls construction is on the increase in GCC. REITs can be formed by the mall owners, in order to capitalize the opportunity and diversify their sources of funding. HNW and affluent investors from GCC and across the globe might be interested to invest in Commercial REITs in GCC, as the outlook for luxury retail sector in GCC is positive till 2022(GCC Luxury Retail, Marmore). However, regulatory agencies must provide a proper framework for the REITs to develop in the GCC region.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
For both conventional as well as Islamic REITs to be popularized and listed in GCC, there is a pre-requisite that there is must be regulations in place for their operations. Capital market authorities can consider implementing broadly followed regulations such as the US model for conventional REITs and Malaysian model for the Islamic REITs after analyzing their suitability to the local market conditions.</div>[:ar]<div style="text-align: justify;">Though UAE and KSA, the major markets in GCC have regulations for REITs, restriction on foreign ownership of property, with the exception of few places in Dubai, and restrictions for foreign investments in capital markets pose challenges to the development of REITs in the region.

REITs can be formed by the mall owners, in order to capitalize the opportunity and diversify their sources of funding. HNW and affluent investors from GCC and across the globe might be interested to invest in Commercial REITs in GCC, as the outlook for luxury retail sector in GCC is positive till 2022(GCC Luxury Retail, Marmore). However, regulatory agencies must provide a proper framework for the REITs to develop in the GCC region.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
For both conventional as well as Islamic REITs to be popularized and listed in GCC, there is a pre-requisite that there is must be regulations in place for their operations. Capital market authorities can consider implementing broadly followed regulations such as the US model for conventional REITs and Malaysian model for the Islamic REITs after analyzing their suitability to the local market conditions.</div>[:]]]></Content>

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">

The article originally appeared in The National | Business.

Is this the perfect time for GCC private equity and venture capital to scale up?

After the global financial crisis, private equity activity in the GCC declined tremendously. Fundraising became anaemic, despite the sizeable amount of dry powder accumulated over the boom years, and deals had stalled as acquisition finance became expensive and difficult to obtain. After a long hibernation, value raised under private equity experienced a quantum leap from US$900 million in 2013 to $2.4bn in 2014, but fell to $500m last year.

The recent entry of UAE and Qatar into the MSCI Emerging Markets index has led to many market reforms across the region aimed at improving disclosures and standardising corporate governance. But nascent legal and regulatory framework, with stringent foreign ownership restrictions, weak bankruptcy laws and high set-up costs, continue to dampen investor enthusiasm.

So what has changed in the recent past? Last year marked one of the worst years for oil prices and revenues – the backbone of most of the GCC economies. And the consensus forecast for the next two years indicates only a modest increase in prices, at less than $60 per barrel, a consider­able fall from the high of $115 per barrel in June 2014.

Such a drastic drop in revenues has triggered a liquidity fall, affecting several sectors of the GCC, especially in banking and financial services industry.

Growth in deposits are lagging behind credit growth and this deficit is accentuated by falling government deposits and continued remittance outflows.

Government borrowing has also been on the rise, which crowds out the private sector and deprives them of credit facilities. S&P has already forecast that Saudi Arabia is expected to tap international debt markets by 2016-17, as the domestic banking system can lend only up to $100bn, which comprises only one-third of their borrowing needs.

In addition, the looming rate hikes from the Fed could increase cost of capital, which makes it more difficult for the private sector to access funds. The IPO market, which in 2014 had 14 new issues worth $9.7bn, including the listing of NCB, the largest IPO in the region, had a dull year last year, with fewer than five new issues.

Most companies are staying away from floating shares in the GCC markets, owing to the oil price volatility and weak global cues. This hurts small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups, which were already facing stringent collateral requirements, including personal guarantees.

Banks are reserved about funding SMEs because of their limited size and higher risks as SMEs are more vulnerable to eco­nomic fluctuations. Larger corporations in the GCC also rely heavily on bank financing, as it allows them to be less transparent and maintain greater control over their operations. But this leads to crowding out of funds as SMEs compete directly for capital with large corporations. For example, in Kuwait, the percentage of total bank loans given to SMEs is as low as 2 per cent. Fewer options in terms of Sharia-compliant products also imply that many SMEs find themselves excluded from the banking sector.

The number of start-ups have also risen in recent years and require strategic guidance to expand during the early stages. It is in this setting of challenging economic situations coupled with growing number of start-ups that PE & VC funds cannot only provide the required capital but also leverage on their industry contacts to share their domain expertise, streamline operations and thus create value for these businesses.

For example, Saudi Arabia’s STC Ventures provided a $3m venture capital funding for Compareit4me.com, a Dubai- based finance comparison start-up, which is expanding into Saudi Arabia. STC would also facilitate expansion by getting local support, and access to untapped sectors.

Many major sectors in the GCC are set to grow in the coming years, as rising disposable incomes will inevitably lead to higher consumption of goods and services. Expanding retail businesses, from jewellery, beauty and cosmetics, clothing, supermarkets and restaurants are expected to intensify investor interest, with significant opportunities in online retail (general and discount) space, as mobile penetration continues to rise in the region.

Luxury retailing is already a thriving business in the GCC – propelled by affluent locals, splurging expatriates, growing brand-aware youthful population and deep-pocketed tourists. Rising public spending in education has been driven by the need to develop skills of a rapidly growing population in the GCC countries and offer considerable opportunities for PE players.

Similarly, health care has attracted a lot of investments in the PE space, as the need to tackle the effects of lifestyle issues and newly introduced mandatory insurance are driving industry growth. In the en­ergy sector, GCC states have also started exploring alternative sources of energy including ­solar power, nuclear and natural gas to boost capacity and diversify the energy mix.

Governments are also focused on modernising their transport and infrastructure, in partnership with the private sector. The entry of PEs into the family businesses can help in the greater flow of ideas, realign focus on core assets and competency, and can generate lead to better sustainability.

Private equity funds could fill the existing funding gap and take advantage of the growing regional economy.

		<Title>[:en]Saudi Arabia seeking alternative transportation[:ar]تسعى المملكة العربية السعودية إلى طرق نقل بديلة[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">Expenditure on the transportation sector in Saudi Arabia has primarily been focused on road networks. Larger land area and higher density of vehicles per Km are one of the important factors behind the increased investments in transport and infrastructure over the years.<br />
<br />
Saudi Arabia stands first among the GCC nations, when compared on the grounds of investments made in road sector. Of all investments made in GCC in road projects, close to half of the investment share comes from Saudi Arabia followed by Kuwait and UAE.<br />
<br />
Huge investments are being made into the sector both in maintenance and to cater to new demands. From 1990 to 2015, the total length of asphalted and paved agricultural roads implemented by Ministry of Transport has grown by a CAGR of 10%. In 2015, total length of asphalted roads stood at 134,498 Kms, which forms more than half of the total road network in Saudi Arabia.<br />
<br />
The budget for 2016 has allocated a sum of USD 6.45bn for Infrastructure and Transportation sector, a decrease of 63% from previous year. Oil price decline has forced the government to cut down spending on key infrastructure projects marking a biggest shakeup in the economic policy of the country.<br />
<br />
According to the report, Railways never really made inroads in the GCC; in fact, most countries do not even have railway networks. However, the region&rsquo;s growing population is increasing the demand for transport infrastructure. Moreover, congestion on roads and increasing trade has spurred a demand for an alternative. Saudi Arabia aims to change it by constructing a vast array of railway station at important cities &ndash; Riyadh, Makkah, Medina and Jeddah. Some large railway projects that are being planned or executed in Saudi Arabia are the Land Bridge, the Haramain High Speed Rail Project, ADA - Riyadh Light Rail Transit (Riyadh Metro), MOT-Jeddah Metro: Orange & Blue Line, Medina Municipality - Medina Monorail, SAR - Minerals Railway.<br />
<br />
Railway network in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia extends for a total length of 1,412 Kms and it links Eastern Province and Riyadh. Riyadh is home to 40% of the country&rsquo;s population and 50% of the economic activity. The trains carry annually more than million passengers each year and 300,000+ containers. Majority of the containers are directed to Riyadh Province through Dammam Port. Passengers carried by Saudi&rsquo;s railways reached 1 Mn in 2015 increasing at a CAGR of 4.82%. Passenger numbers are expected to go up on completion of the Haramain High Speed Rail (HHSR).<br />
<br />
The challenge for railways in the region is to attract patrons. The culture of travelling in train is something that is relatively new to the region unlike in the EU or Asia. Shifting citizens to travel by trains is essential for the government&rsquo;s long term plans of shifting away from oil-based economy. With oil prices already forcing Saudi government to cut down on its expenses it might also be a good time for laying the foundation for acceptance of large-scale public transport among the citizens.</div>[:ar]<div style="text-align: justify;">Expenditure on the transportation sector in Saudi Arabia has primarily been focused on road networks.

		<Title>[:en]Why Saudi Arabia Requires Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?[:ar]لماذا تطلب السعودية فاني ماي وفريدي ماك؟[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">

Mortgage penetration rates (mortgage debt as a percentage of GDP) in Saudi Arabia are low at 2%, compared to 5-10% in the neighboring GCC countries. In contrast, developed countries like the US and UK, have mortgage penetration rates of more than 70%. However, various efforts such as introduction of mortgage law, tax on vacant land and establishing Saudi Real Estate Development Fund (REDF) to increase home ownership helped mortgage loan book to grow by about 40% annually between 2011 and 2014. However, the requirement of a 30% down payment by the buyer on a property’s value introduced in late-2014 almost dried up demand for mortgages. In response, Saudi Arabia’s central bank slashed the down payment needed by half to 15% for house buyers to obtain a mortgage. Though this is a cheering move, the attractiveness of this benefit could be curbed by factors such as potential higher cost of borrowing for borrowers due to ongoing liquidity tightening faced by the regional banks. Moreover, the affordability of  the 15% down-payment limit can be debated considering the disparity between the average home costs and average national salary.

Taking into account the challenges hampering KSA’s vision to increase the level of home ownership amongst its citizens, KSA’s move to start a state-owned mortgage firm similar to the U.S. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could be a game changer. Though these government-sponsored enterprises’ (GSEs) are criticized for being responsible for the 2008 financial crisis, their role in fulfilling the “American dream” of owning a home is undeniable.
An assessment of the role of these institutions in the U.S. market would lend better perspective in understanding the need for similar enterprises in Saudi Arabia.

<strong>The role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac </strong>
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were created for the important role of supporting and enhancing the U.S housing finance system. The primary objective of these government-sponsored enterprises’ (GSEs) is to provide liquidity, stability and affordability to the mortgage market.

<img style="width: 723px; height: 691px;" title="KSA-Requires-Fannie-Mae-and-Freddie-Mac-Fig1.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/KSA-Requires-Fannie-Mae-and-Freddie-Mac-Fig1.jpg" alt="KSA-Requires-Fannie-Mae-and-Freddie-Mac-Fig1.jpg" />

<strong>Liquidity</strong>
They provide liquidity to the banks, savings and loans, and mortgage companies that make loans to finance housing. These GSEs provide liquidity or in a way fund these mortgages by purchasing loans directly from primary market mortgage originators, such as banks and mortgage companies, and holding these loans in portfolio, or by acting as a channel and issuing mortgage-backed securities (MBS), which are then sold in the capital markets to a wide variety of investors. Lenders use the cash raised by selling mortgages to these GSEs to engage in further lending.

The GSEs’ purchases ensures stability to the mortgage industry by providing ample liquidity to the mortgage lenders. The spillover effect is that individuals and families looking to buy homes and investors that purchase apartment buildings and other multifamily dwellings have a continuous, stable supply of mortgage money.

<strong>Secondary Market and Reduced Cost of Borrowing</strong>
The federal guarantee backing these GSEs provides investors a lot of confidence in the packaged mortgage securities offered by these institutions and thus increasing the attractiveness of these MBS instruments. The assurance of timely payment of principle and interest has attracted investors who might otherwise refrain from investing in mortgages, thereby expanding the pool of funds available for housing. The liquidity enjoyed by these instruments coupled with federal credit guarantee reduces the investor’s return expectations and thus lowering the interest rates paid by homeowners and other mortgage borrowers.

<strong>Promoting Affordable Housing</strong>
Besides encouraging a stable supply of mortgage financing, federal housing policy aims to make home ownership more affordable for low and moderate income households. The government subsidizes the cost of housing through its support of the secondary mortgage market by being willing to purchase and guarantee mortgages. They have passed a mortgage interest rate subsidy of 25–50 basis points to homebuyers through their interventions in the housing market (The Role of GSEs in the Housing Market (Heritage.org)). The federal government has also tried to improve access to mortgage financing through annual targets for the percentage of mortgages bought by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that were made to low and moderate income borrowers(Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Role in the Secondary Mortgage Market). Additionally in an effort to increase lending to low income and first time home buyers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are backing mortgages with down payments of as little as 3% of the home's price( CNNMoney).

<strong>KSA – Precautions to be adopted</strong>
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are criticized for creating the demand for subprime loans which was the root cause for the financial crisis. As of June 2008, the 78% of the 31mn risky subprime loans were on the books of these GSEs. These GSEs prior to 1992 were only accepting prime mortgages in which the borrower had a FICO credit score of 660 and above,  made a down payment of 10%-20% and had low levels of debt to income. However, with the affordable housing goals program adopted in 1992, these GSEs were mandated to acquire 30% of loans made to borrowers below 80% and 60% of median income. Between 1993 and 2000, The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) raised the 30% goals to 50%, and between 2001 and 2008 it raised the goals to 56%. Considering the challenge to meet these quotas, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac started accepting increasing numbers of subprime mortgages.

The relaxing of underwriting standards to meet the affordable housing quotas by GSEs was subsequently adopted by other mortgage lenders. This liberalization of lending norms led to loans getting approved with zero down payment. All these factors collectively led to creation of the housing bubble which then culminated into one of largest global financial crisis. A surface level assessment substantiates the role of these GSEs in facilitating mortgage lending in the US market by addressing the core issues such as liquidity and affordability. Establishing similar institute is the answer to achieve the goals of improving higher levels of home ownership and affordable housing. However, the mortgage company should avoid the error in the form of excessive liberal underwriting process motivated by aggressive affordable housing goals committed by the US GSEs.

<div style="text-align: justify;">Urbanisation and rising disposable income has resulted in many of the younger citizens adopting a “Western Lifestyle” which is characterized by an aversion to exercise and consumption of processed foods leading to increasing instances of diseases such as diabetes, coronary problems and other obesity related illness that were not prevalent in the region previously.</div>
<div></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Dubai is gaining popularity as a medical tourism destination due to its low cost, English speaking medical staff and virtually no queues for treatment. According to Marmore’s UAE Healthcare report, Medical tourism is a highly profitable business and UAE attracts attention owing to its proximity to Europe and Africa.</div>
<div></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Mandatory health insurance was first introduced in the country in Abu Dhabi in 2007 in a pilot project and it was followed by Dubai which introduced mandatory health insurance in 2014. Across the region mandatory health insurance is expected to be a major driver of expansion and investment in the healthcare sector. While the mandatory health insurance in Abu Dhabi is fully implemented, Dubai’s mandatory health insurance scheme is expected to be completely rolled out in 2016. There are also talks of similar mandatory insurance programme to be implemented in the Northern Emirates of the country. Insurance has played an important role in attracting the private healthcare providers to the market.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">

The UAE pharmaceutical market is a relatively well-developed market in the GCC region. According to Marmore’s UAE Healthcare report, UAE Pharmaceutical market size is projected to rise from USD 2.4 billion in 2013 to USD 3.7 billion in 2020 at a rate of 5.3% (Source: <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/uae-pharmaceutical-market-at-37b-by-2020-healthcare-industry-in-united-arab-emirates-forecast-to-show-significant-growth-potential-274356961.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here</a>). The UAE market continues to lure manufacturers and traders to the region and Dubai has experienced a strong growth in pharmaceutical trade. Currently the UAE market is driven primarily by branded medicines, with generic medicine consumption at only about 20 per cent. Since the cost of branded medicines tend to be on the higher side the federal government of UAE introduced price controls in a phased manner since 2011. By seeking to reduce the medical cost inflation the ministry of health has brought down prices of 8,000 drugs since 2011.

Information Technology in healthcare in the UAE remains as one of the most promising as well as challenging growth area. IT infrastructure in the UAE is currently run by independent healthcare systems with little integration among each other. UAE’s government is aware of the issue and has initiated few integration programmes in areas such as Data management, Disease screening and Medicine registry.

Healthcare sector in UAE is regulated by a number of different organizations at the federal and the Emirate level. All of these organizations are unified by a central authority, The Ministry of Health (MoH). Insurance in the country is currently regulated by the Ministry of Finance (MoF) while a standalone organization the FHIA (The Federal health Insurance Authority) is being setup.

Historically, healthcare in the UAE market has been perceived to be of lower quality than many developed countries. According to Marmore’s UAE Healthcare report, UAE nationals typically use these systems for performing initial diagnosis and basic services. For performing major surgery and treating serious disorders, such as cancer, heart and renal diseases expatriates return home while Emirati nationals usually go to the West (Germany, Switzerland and the US). Emiratis have expressed a preference for getting treatment from outside the country.

UAE’s healthcare infrastructure has been recognized as on par with international standards driven by the strong push by the government and its business friendly regulations. In the recent years the shift to a market model is evident given the introduction of mandatory health insurance in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. It is also rapidly increasing its efforts to treat its patients inside the country rather than sending them abroad for receiving advanced treatments. In order to deal with future challenges, UAE is also ramping up its investments in IT, supply chain, equipment management etc., While operating in UAE healthcare market is not without its challenges, recent collaborations with international healthcare brands such as Cleveland Clinic and John Hopkins increase the confidence of potential investors entering into the market.

<div style="text-align: justify;">Urbanisation and rising disposable income has resulted in many of the younger citizens adopting a “Western Lifestyle” which is characterized by an aversion to exercise and consumption of processed foods leading to increasing instances of diseases such as diabetes, coronary problems and other obesity related illness that were not prevalent in the region previously.</div>
<div></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Dubai is gaining popularity as a medical tourism destination due to its low cost, English speaking medical staff and virtually no queues for treatment. According to Marmore’s UAE Healthcare report, Medical tourism is a highly profitable business and UAE attracts attention owing to its proximity to Europe and Africa.</div>
<div></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Mandatory health insurance was first introduced in the country in Abu Dhabi in 2007 in a pilot project and it was followed by Dubai which introduced mandatory health insurance in 2014. Across the region mandatory health insurance is expected to be a major driver of expansion and investment in the healthcare sector. While the mandatory health insurance in Abu Dhabi is fully implemented, Dubai’s mandatory health insurance scheme is expected to be completely rolled out in 2016. There are also talks of similar mandatory insurance programme to be implemented in the Northern Emirates of the country. Insurance has played an important role in attracting the private healthcare providers to the market.</div>

		<Title>[:en]GCC petrochemical companies need to shift gears if they are to remain competitive[:ar]تحتاج شركات البتروكيماويات الخليجية إلى تغيير أدواتها إذا أرادت البقاء في ساحة المنافسة[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]The fall in oil means GCC players have lost a key competitive advantage &ndash; low-cost feedstock &ndash; that they have long held over major players in the US and Europe.<br />
<br />
Global players reduced their prices in line with the cost of feedstock, leading to a decline in petrochemical prices. Despite being aware of oil&rsquo;s volatility, GCC&rsquo's petrochemical groups were underprepared to face such prolonged low oil prices. Most major players failed to develop risk-mitigation strategies and adopt newer technology, despite having the capability to fund and build megaprojects.<br />
<br />
The outlook is challenging. The oil price is not expected to return to US$80 to $120 a barrel in the next two or years. Oil prices at $30 to $60 a barrel might increase the supply of petrochemicals, as US and European operators would be keen to cash in on this scenario. Another major development is the $130 billion mergers of Dow Chemical and DuPont, two of the world&rsquo;s largest petrochemical producers, which is expected to create the world&rsquo;s largest petrochemical entity &ndash; a formidable rival for GCC players.<br />
<br />
In reaction, GCC patches need to overhaul their operations to suit naphtha-based crackers. They are currently using ethane crackers because of subsidies. Naphtha crackers are more efficient and the output produced is of higher quality.<br />
<br />
Overall the GCC players need to optimize operations and inculcate efficiency in production &ndash; optimization being more along the lines of reducing time (by integrated plants) and efficiency by actions such as improving skills and bringing in new technology.<br />
<br />
Downstream integration must be the focus of GCC players. It would help in capturing not only downstream producers but also end-product manufacturers.<br />
<br />
Downstream integration of oil refining, petrochemical production, and producing further downstream products such as paints is an area where GCC producers can invest. They can take cues from major international players such as Du Pont and Dow Chemical, which produce thousands of products using downstream manufacturing.<br />
<br />
Currently, GCC companies that are entering into joint ventures with international players must look beyond capital and technology transfer in these ventures. Skill development, building organizational efficiencies as in US and European players, and improving their functional and technical expertise will help petrochemical companies cruise the hard waters ahead.<br />
<br />
Major integration projects in the GCC, such as Al Zour refinery being constructed in Kuwait, will help them improve the efficiency of production. Government ownership in these companies will be the major supporting factor in the coming years.<br />
<br />
The impetus for change is clear, as a few numbers will show.<br />
<br />
Global prices of key petrochemicals such as propylene, benzene, and ethylene declined by 60, 56, and 40 percent, respectively, from March 2014 to September 2015. An oil supply glut in the global markets and the resultant low oil-price scenario coupled with lower demand for petrochemicals from Asian countries such as India and China are reasons for the drastic decline in petrochemical prices. Cheaper oil also resulted in increased production of petrochemicals in US and Europe. This has severely affected petrochemical players in the GCC region. Earnings at Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (Sabic), the largest petrochemicals producer in the Middle East, fell by 19.3 percent last year.<br />
<br />
The current market dynamics indicate that GCC petrochemicals will face an even tougher situation in the coming years.<br />
<br />
Asia (excluding China) accounts for about 35 percent of petrochemical exports from GCC. China alone accounts for 15.3 percent. Asia&rsquo's petrochemical import volumes are estimated to fall by 50 percent in 2015 and 2016 because of lower demand in the Asian markets for products such as polyester and purified terephthalic acid (PTA).<br />
<br />
The impact of the Chinese slowdown and devaluation of the yuan, which made imports costlier, affected exports from the GCC last year. That could be magnified this year and in 2017. China is aiming to achieve self-reliance in petrochemicals production. Self-sufficiency in ethylene production is expected to be achieved by 2018.<br />
India is another major importer of petrochemicals from the GCC. Its paints industry, which uses more than 150 petrochemicals, is reeling from the threat of a slowdown, after real-estate activity in the country declined by 3 percent last year. With the low oil price, India has reopened one of its petrochemical plants to reduce its import bill.<br />

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]The Education system is divided into 4 levels
<ul>
	<li>K-12 Education (Kindergarten, primary and secondary education)</li>
	<li>Higher Education</li>
	<li>Technical Education</li>
	<li>Special Education (Differentially abled students)</li>
</ul>
Government has encouraged education by providing free education to Emirati students while charging nominal fees for expatriate students. The gross enrolment ratio for the primary education is comparable to the world average.

<div style="text-align: justify;"><br />
The Abu Dhabi Education Council (ADEC), the Dubai Education Council (DEC) and the UAE Ministry of Education (MOE) are each tasked with education reform, while preserving local traditions, principles and the cultural identity of the UAE. Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA) is another body which is responsible for the growth and the quality of private education in Dubai.<br />
<br />
According to Marmore&rsquo;s UAE Education report, the Ministry of education has come up with education development plan 2015 to 2021 for the development of the education sector. The initiatives are directed towards educating the rising population as well as increasing foreign investment. The UAE federal government introduced a set of seven initiatives which is aimed at improving the R&D capabilities and innovation. The UAE Vision 2021 National Agenda emphasizes the development of a first-rate education system, which will require a complete transformation of the current education system and teaching methods. There is increase in disposable income per capita in the UAE. Increased income coupled with preference for quality education and increasing population increases the demand for better schools. Government has allocated USD 272 million towards the smart learning project, which aims to equip all public schools in the UAE with tablets and high speed 4G connectivity.<br />
<br />
In 2012, 70% private schools in Abu Dhabi were oversubscribed. With rising population, the number of applicants in private schools is likely to rise. Keeping this demand in mind, the ADEC has offered cheap land to private schools in Abu Dhabi. The increase in population gives rise to demand for education. According to Abu Dhabi Education Council (ADEC), there will be a shortage of 25,000 seats in academic year 2015-16.<br />
<br />
We have taken into consideration the past growth population growth rate and enrolment rate and have forecasted the enrolments for the next 7 seven years. The projection model also takes into consideration the literacy rate and the public expenditure as a % of GDP while forecasting these numbers.<br />

<br />
As per the KHDA, there will be huge need for vocational education in future as Dubai grows. Their study estimates that UAE will have a labour shortage of about 200,000 by end of 2015 and thus key industries would require huge workforce. To address this demand supply gap, QAD (Qualification and Awards in Dubai) will develop qualifications recognized by the National Qualification Authority and the Vocational Education and Training Awards Council.<br />
<br />
Education in UAE is not without its own challenges. While the demography is usually favourable, UAE experiences a lot of expat inflows and outflows resulting in huge turnover of students as well making it difficult to anticipate the demand. Construction cost is high in UAE; this combined with a cap on fees exacerbates the problem potentially keeping investors at bay.<br />
<br />
Government of Dubai however has been making huge strides in order to promote its country as a knowledge based society. One such example is the Dubai International Academic City (DIAC) is the world&rsquo;s largest Free Zone dedicated to Higher Education. DIAC boasts of multi-tiered International Branch Campuses (IBC&#39;s), from 10 different countries and to cater to about 20,000 students of 125 nationalities with choice of pursuing over 400 Higher Education programs.</div>[:ar]The Education system is divided into 4 levels

		<Title>[:en]KSA Education is in a state of transition[:ar]يشهد التعليم في المملكة العربية السعودية حالة من التحول[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">

Public expenditure on Education in Saudi Arabia is expected to hover around c.7% of  nominal GDP in near future. Based on our estimates, the total market-size of KSA education market by spending is estimated at USD 66.66Bn in 2014.

The formal education system in Saudi Arabia is similar to overall GCC education structure and can be divided into three broad levels: primary, secondary and tertiary. Noticeably, pre-primary education in Saudi Arabia is not a part of formal education structure unlike some of its GCC peers. According to Marmore’s KSA Education report, primary and Secondary education together lasts for 12 years and Tertiary  Education can last upto 9 years. Educational institutions in KSA can be public or private. Private Schools can be divided based on types of curriculum (Arabic, Bilingual, Asian or Western Schools).

The demand for private schools have increased in Saudi Arabia due to better quality of education and also due to a law passed in 2009 which allowed Saudi nationals to be enrolled in international schools. The country has also witnessed significant growth in private universities during the past decade.

Since pre-primary level of education is not a part of formal education structure, the gross enrollments ratio (GER) (13.2%, 2012) at this level of education in KSA is very low when compared with other GCC countries and some of the developed and developing countries. According to Marmore’s KSA Education report, the GER (Gross Enrolment Rate)  at the primary level in KSA (102.77%, 2012) and GER at secondary level (114.27%, 2012) is comparable to other countries. The GER at tertiary level in KSA (50.94%, 2012) is highest within GCC, however still much less than some of the developed countries. KSA has still has a long way to develop their tertiary education system to help their young population equip with the right set of skills and expertise to meet the job markets demand, instead of being dependent upon importing expatriate skilled labor force.

Our enrolment forecast for various levels of education is as follows:

<img style="width: 553px; height: 212px;" title="ksa-education_Fig1.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ksa-education_Fig1.jpg" alt="ksa-education_Fig1.jpg" />

KSA education sector is poised to grow aided by its’ growing population and relatively high proportion of young age population. Increasing government support to the sector and increasing income level of Saudi population will also play positive for the sector. High level of unemployment among Saudi nationals, mainly due to disconnect between their skill sets and market needs, will further drive demand for better quality education.

Growing size of the education market in KSA will provide ample opportunities for private players at all levels. More specifically opportunities in higher education market are vast. Private players will get benefitted from government support to private sector and growing preference for private educational institutes.

However, Saudi education sector also faces a number of challenges. Gross enrolment rates at pre-primary and tertiary levels are low. The quality of programs and curricula designed for public institutions in KSA is not considered of high standards. The sector faces a challenge to due to increasing cost of establishing and operating an educational institute. Fast reforms are required to improve the quality of education as well as to increase the supply of educational institutions to match the growing demand.

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]According to Marmore’s recently published report on <a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/kuwait-projects-kwd-10bn-awarded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kuwait Projects</a>, in 2015, Kuwait awarded projects worth KWD 10bn, an increase of 20% compared to 2014. The aggregate value of projects awarded during 2014 and 2015 was KWD 18bn. However, this is yet to impact positively on key areas of the economy.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-3070 size-full" title="Projects Impact Indicator" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Kuwait-Projects.png" alt="Projects Impact Indicator" width="621" height="566" />

<span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #696969; font-size: 10px;">Source: Marmore; * World Bank estimates, **As per IIF, 2015 nominal GDP of Kuwait - USD 121.1bn</span>

As of Q1 2016, there are 420 ongoing projects in Kuwait, 19 projects valued at KWD 34bn (USD 112.2bn) placed on hold and another 20 projects valued at KWD 7bn (USD 22.1bn) shelved. Some of the key areas that were expected to be positively impacted are the banking (liquidity & credit growth) and capital markets (debt & equity). However, the awarding of projects is yet to create any impact on capital markets and had a marginal impact on banks’ credit growth. Bank’s credit, which was expected to be significantly impacted, grew with 8% increase in credit growth at the end of 2015 compared to 2014. And, the corporate earnings in Kuwait have contracted at the end of 2015 compared to 2014. All these factors ascertain that the awarding of projects during 2014 and 2015 is yet to stimulate the growth of the Kuwaiti economy as anticipated.

The reasons highlighted in the report for the absence of tangible effects of these projects are:

- In the current situation, much of the projects went to contracting and construction companies rather than PPP. A PPP focused project awards can have quick pass through effect benefitting many legs of the economy.

- Duration taken for the projects to be completed: Considering some of the largest (in terms of value) projects completed during the 2012 to 2015 periods, the average duration taken for these projects to be completed was 5 years

- The contra effect of the low oil price on economy: As the positive effect of the projects awarded is weathered by the negative impact of low oil prices on the economy

- Projects awarded are skewed towards oil & gas sector - A majority of the completed projects are from oil & gas sector and since Kuwait is an oil-dependent economy, the economic significance of these projects is high. However, given the lower oil price prevailing since mid-2014, this would not have resulted in expected level of revenue generation

Some of the trends summarized in the report are that projects awarded are showing signs of growth with the increase from KWD 3bn in 2012 to KWD 10bn in 2015 and the decline in oil prices hasn’t significantly impacted the project’s landscape in Kuwait.

A sector wise assessment indicates that the real estate sector is the most dominant segment for projects in Kuwait with the highest number of ongoing projects (154) worth KWD 37bn. However, Oil & gas, power & water sector projects accounted for 74% of projects completed (by value) between 2012 and 2015. As far the new projects are concerned almost 50% of the projects signed in 2015 belong to the oil and gas sector. A majority of the ongoing projects in Kuwait are in the early stages of execution.
<blockquote>The Kuwait Authority of Partnership Projects (KAPP), is expected to award PPP projects worth KWD 2bn (USD 6.6bn) in 2016 and as of Q1 2016, there are 22 ongoing projects from real estate and power & water sectors. The Al Zour IWPP is the largest ongoing PPP project in Kuwait.</blockquote>[:ar]According to Marmore’s recently published report on <a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/kuwait-projects-kwd-10bn-awarded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kuwait Projects</a>, in 2015, Kuwait awarded projects worth KWD 10bn, an increase of 20% compared to 2014.

Of all the sub-sectors, real estate is gaining the most momentum as 57.7% projects in pipeline as of April 2015 belong to real estate. Dubai and Abu Dhabi are particularly driving the contracting sector in UAE. Out of all the 860 projects ongoing as of April 2015 in the UAE region, 87% are Dubai and Abu Dhabi based.</span></p>

As of 2015, there are 500 ongoing projects in the real estate sector while 110 projects are on hold.  In the sub-sector category of real estate, community development is leading in terms of value while the maximum number of ongoing projects is in residential development.</span></p>

<span class="Normal__Char" style="line-height: 18pt; font-family: Tahoma, Arial; font-size: 10pt;">The diversification plans of the government are promoting the growth in industries like travel & tourism, hospitality and, agro-chemicals thereby increasing the number and volume of projects in construction. The projects related to transport, infrastructure and hotels are in the pipeline as the number of international arrivals are increasing in UAE.  Dubai has become the tourist hub in the whole GCC region. According to </span><a style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 18pt;" href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/uae-contracting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="Hyperlink__Char" style="color: #0563c1;"><span class="Hyperlink__Char" style="color: #000000; font-family: Tahoma, Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Marmore’s UAE Contracting report</span></span></a><span class="Normal__Char" style="line-height: 18pt; font-family: Tahoma, Arial; font-size: 10pt;">, the foreign spending in UAE was USD 22.6 billion at real prices in 2013 while the same statistic for Saudi Arabia and Qatar was USD 8.18 billion and USD 5.48 billion. The foreign spending in UAE was 55.8% of the total foreign spending in GCC in 2013 . Dubai Airport has already overtaken Heathrow as the busiest airport in the world. The increasing international tourists, GDP Per Capita, young population and the government spending are the key drivers of contracting sector in the UAE.</span>

Any disruption in Government spending or Government policies can change the course of growth in the construction sector. Also, the lacking transparency in the policies, delay in project approval adds more uncertainty in the industry. One more challenge in this category is the diversification of the funds which are mostly public driven in construction sector. On the back of strong reserves and financial position, the government funds are able to help the construction sector. But, in future, in order to maintain the same growth pattern, the source of funds needs to be diversified.</span></p>

<span style="font-family: Tahoma, Arial; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 18pt;">Despite the growth in the contracting sector, there exist a number of challenges which may hinder the growth of sector. A positive outlook of the real-estate though encouraging, is also leading to rise in inflation levels. As a result, it might lead to a housing bubble. Other risks include heavy reliance on government spending and government initiated projects, low oil prices and the threats of Globalization. A proper monitoring of real-estate pricing levels should be done to keep the inflationary pressure in check. </span>

NCB Capital was the leading fund manager (in terms of AUM) with USD 7.03 billion in assets (35% market share), followed by Samba capital with USD 3.83 billion (19% market share) and Al Rajhi Capital with USD 3.31 billion (12% market share).</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Saudi capital markets are characterized by lack of private institutional players and foreign investors which is expected to improve in the coming years following the opening up of Saudi stock market to foreign investors. Investor base primarily consists of retail investors and large state investors. Saudi Arabia has opened up its markets to foreign investors recently. The QFIs  (Qualified Foreign Investors) who are interested in entering the market should have a minimum AUM of USD $5Bn (Can be reduced to $ 3 Bn at the discretion of CMA) for applying. A QFI must fall within the categories – Banks, Brokerage & Securities Firm, Fund Managers and Insurance companies.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Currently, the three state institutional investors - General Organization for Social Insurance, Public Pension Authority and Public Investment Fund - form the largest group of institutional investors; private institutional investors such as private pension funds, insurance companies and mutual funds are too small in size to play a substantial role. According to Marmore’s Saudi Arabia asset management report, retail clients form the bulk of market participants in Saudi markets. Debt market is small in size and under developed but given the recent issue of bond by the Saudi government. Allowing foreign institutional investors to invest in the stock market has been largely seen as a positive sign by local wealth managers in the GCC region. Efforts to widen the investor base, introduction of various products to facilitate hedging and enhanced price discovery and increased disclosure norms for listed firms would augur well for the asset management industry.</div>[:ar]<div style="text-align: justify;">According to Marmore’s Saudi Arabia asset management report, the market is concentrated among the top asset management companies, with the top five asset managers (out of a total of 33 managers) accounting for 86% of the total assets being managed.

A QFI must fall within the categories – Banks, Brokerage & Securities Firm, Fund Managers and Insurance companies.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Currently, the three state institutional investors - General Organization for Social Insurance, Public Pension Authority and Public Investment Fund - form the largest group of institutional investors; private institutional investors such as private pension funds, insurance companies and mutual funds are too small in size to play a substantial role. According to Marmore’s Saudi Arabia asset management report, retail clients form the bulk of market participants in Saudi markets. Debt market is small in size and under developed but given the recent issue of bond by the Saudi government. Allowing foreign institutional investors to invest in the stock market has been largely seen as a positive sign by local wealth managers in the GCC region. Efforts to widen the investor base, introduction of various products to facilitate hedging and enhanced price discovery and increased disclosure norms for listed firms would augur well for the asset management industry.</div>[:]]]></Content>

The residential real estate market in Qatar is characterized by undersupply and the increasing demand is expected to add to the existing market pressure. Qatar is forecasted to add a cumulative supply of 22,000 units during 2014-2018 to the residential real estate market, a CAGR of 2%, while the demand is estimated to increase at 10% CAGR during the same period.<br />

Qatar&rsquo;s GDP growth rate is forecasted by IMF to remain positive during 2015-17 period, especially for the non-hydrocarbon sector, which is expected to grow at approximately 10% over the next three years, mainly driven by the growth in construction and real estate. According to Marmore&rsquo;s Qatar residential real estate report, Real estate sector is expected to attract 49.2% of the total estimated USD 80.2bn spending until 2017.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The increased spending in real estate will help in creation of more housing units in affordable and high end housing segments.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The demand for housing units can be expected to increase as 85% of Qatar&rsquo;s population comprises of non-nationals, with projects such as Pearl Qatar allowing free hold ownership for non-Qataris, which may lead to an increase in the sale price. Many of the expatriates in Qatar, especially the white-collared professionals, would be willing to invest in Qatar&rsquo;s real estate and own dwelling units. Allowing free hold of property for expatriates in all major developments would boost the demand for residential units in the country.<br />

		<Title>[:en]Secondary Market of Sukuk: An Overview[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]This article was first published in Islamic Finance news Volume 17 Issue 1 dated the 8th January 2020

Sukuk are useful instruments, both for issuers as well as investors. They can be an alternative source of funds for governments and conventional institutions, a liquidity management tool for Islamic banks and institutions whose investments must be Shariah compliant and a source of portfolio diversification for conventional institutions.

However, in order to benefit from the advantages of Sukuk, the primary and secondary markets need to be very active. In reality however, the Sukuk secondary market is very weak, hindering its growth prospects. The low level of secondary market activity makes issuing Sukuk very expensive.

Expensive issuing costs can make issuers reluctant to issue Sukuk. The low number of issuances limits the investment opportunities for Islamic institutions, mainly Islamic banks which may then find managing liquidity challenging.

<blockquote><a href="https://www.databook.marmoremena.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong> Did You Know? </strong> 
<span style="color: #800000;"> 
<ul class="rdetails_list" style="text-align: left;">
<li style="text-align: left;">Kuwait has the highest reserves among GCC countries, relative to its GDP at 542%. </li>
<li style="text-align: left;"> Saudi Arabia is expected to enjoy the highest credit growth at 5.3% in 2020. </li>
<li style="text-align: left;"> UAE could continue to enjoy surplus trade position in 2020. </li>
</span> <strong>Learn more </strong></span></a></blockquote>

Some of the main reasons for a weak secondary market are as follows:

<strong>• Shariah restrictions </strong>
Restrictions on tradability in the secondary market come fundamentally from a Shariah ruling by the OIC, which states that for tradability of Sukuk in the secondary market in accordance with Shariah, Sukuk should represent a direct link with physical (underlying) assets, instead of denoting debt.

<strong>• Lack of standardization </strong>
The lack of standardization is a major impediment in the further development of the Sukuk market. The lack of standardization in documentation and Shariah interpretations among Islamic nations makes issuance costs of Sukuk structures higher than conventional bonds. Sukuk structures that are considered acceptable in one market may not be equally accepted in another jurisdiction. Gulf-based Shariah scholars have rejected certain structures used in Asia, a region that has proven to be more flexible in its transactions. For example, transactions involving the purchase and sale of debt contracts in secondary markets are permissible only in Malaysia as Gulf scholars do not accept the debt based contracts as tradable.

<strong>• Scarcity of supply</strong>
Sukuk structures require extensive and costly legal and religious advice, which adds to the time it takes to issue Sukuk. Sukuk have a complex structure with ownership and transfer of assets and an SPV. Therefore, a restriction on the SPV or transfer and ownership of assets hinders the issuance of Sukuk. Moreover, Sukuk have higher yields than conventional bonds, which further hinders potential issuances. Sukuk also require special tax regulations. The tax and regulatory frameworks of some countries provide for a level playing field between Sukuk and conventional bonds; however, some countries have not adopted Sukuk specific legal and tax regulations yet. Because of these challenges, many entities shy away from issuing Sukuk.

<strong>• Hold-to-maturity culture</strong>
Given the scarcity of supply of Islamic liquidity management instruments, Islamic institutions (particularly Islamic banks) have excess liquidity and lack opportunities to invest. On the other hand, due to a lack of products in which to invest their money, Islamic financial institutions are finding it increasingly difficult to manage short-term liquidity. Sukuk have therefore become a more attractive investment tool for these institutions. However, in Sukuk secondary markets, investors prefer to buy Sukuk and hold until maturity rather than trading as it becomes difficult to find another Sukuk with a similar quality to replace the one they intend to sell.

<strong>• Inadequate trading platforms</strong>
Trading platforms are a key contributory factor in the active secondary market. However, Sukuk trading platforms are not evenly developed in all countries. Moreover, trading platforms also have local restrictions, creating a further lack of standardization in Sukuk trading platforms. In Malaysia for example, Sukuk trading platforms are well developed, but secondary Sukuk market trading platforms in the GCC are limited only to Bahrain, Dubai and Saudi Arabia. Therefore, to achieve increasing supply and active trading in Sukuk, there is a need for well-developed and global trading platforms that provide access to a diverse pool of fixed income investors, generate investor demand and facilitate further liquidity.

&nbsp;
<blockquote>The weak secondary market is a problem waiting to be solved in Sukuk markets, as primary and secondary markets support each other.</blockquote>
Therefore, solving the problems of the secondary market will develop the primary market, which in turn will help develop the secondary market.

In order to benefit from the potential advantages that Sukuk can offer, there needs to be increased corporate and sovereign Sukuk issuance; market standardization in interpretation and issuance; more rated and listed Sukuk; and additional issuance to retail investors.

There is also a need for large global Islamic banks and dedicated traders who will provide bid/ask prices on a continuous basis. The implementation of these proposals can help investors and issuers take advantage of Sukuk extensively.[:]]]></Content>

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">In the GCC, private equity is still at a nascent stage, but had witnessed significant growth between 2002 and 2008. But the onset of global financial crisis stalled growth of the industry. Fundraising had become anemic, despite the sizeable amount of dry powder accumulated over the boom years, and deals had stalled as acquisition finance became expensive and difficult to obtain.<br />
&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Most PE funds in the GCC region have broad sector focus with investments ranging from healthcare to ICT, infrastructure and hard assets like real estate. Analysis reveals there is a strong focus on consumer spending themes such as restaurants, consumer goods, retail, ICT, leisure and entertainment sectors; and governments focused investments play such as infrastructure, education, healthcare etc. Given the deal scarcity and capital abundance, many of the funds that were launched earlier as specialized or sector-focused funds six years ago have rolled back their decision and broadened their mandate to become more opportunistic.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">In comparison to other GCC markets, UAE is a predominant financial hub and acts as a gateway for entry into the Middle East region. Most PE funds are attracted to the relatively hassle free regulatory regime in the UAE, a consequence of the efforts made by the country to attract foreign investments. Continued government spending and increased focus on the non-oil sector are expected to drive PE growth in the coming years. With the Dubai Expo 2020 and the FIFA World Cup in Qatar looming ahead, the non-oil sector comprising infrastructure, tourism, trade and financial services is expected to get a major boost, which opens up avenues for investment for PE. But PE funds are likely to be confronted with intense competition, not only with fundraising, but also in scouting attractive deals.<br />
&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">State owned enterprises which constitute most of the economic activity in GCC region are rarely privatized. Even under the privatization initiative, only minority stakes in these enterprises are floated in the stock exchange, which usually is reserved for and subscribed by the nationals. Apart from the state enterprises, family owned business form the majority of companies in the GCC region. Family business houses are wealthy, well-established and are often reluctant to sell their stakes to private equity firms.<br />
&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Islamic PE is constrained by lesser investment opportunities as only Sharia compliant projects are sought after by these funds. Lack of uniformity in the way sharia principles are applied in different countries, due to absence of global sharia standards, leads to multiple regulatory checks and at times can lead to prolonged delays in structuring and increase costs dramatically. Dearth of qualified, trained professionals with expertise in investment strategies, legal documentation and well versed with sharia standards is a huge deterrent to the development of Islamic finance in general and Islamic private equity in particular.<br />
&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">The nascent legal and regulatory framework in GCC countries, characterized by stringent ownership restrictions, weak bankruptcy laws and high set-up costs, dampen investor enthusiasm.

		<Title>[:en]KSA Brokerage Industry – Challenging Times Ahead[:ar]صناعة الوساطة المالية في المملكة العربية السعودية – الأوقات المقبلة الحافلة بالتحديات[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">Saudi stock market is dominated by the top 10 brokerage firms contributing approximately 90% of the value traded. Some of the players who have ranked atop consistently in the Saudi Arabian market in terms of value traded as brokers include AlJazira Capital, Al Rajhi Financial Services Company, NCB Capital, Samba Capital and HSBC Saudi Arabia. The larger players (i.e.) brokerage divisions of the banks and other standalone players offer full services such as provision of single window for investing in the six GCC countries. Web and PC based trading platforms have been able to make long strides in KSA over the past few years primarily owing to their convenience.<br />
&nbsp;</div>
<img alt="Chart-1.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KSA-Brokerage-Industry-fig1.jpg" style="width: 645px; height: 394px;" title="Chart-1.jpg" />
<div style="text-align: justify;">The Saudi Brokerage industry is regulated by Capital Market Authority (CMA). The CMA only specifies a minimum and maximum brokerage that can be charged by the brokers and offers the brokers the freedom of discounts on the commission in order to attract the clients. The commission charged by the brokerage firms in Saudi Arabia is set at maximum of 0.12% of the value traded by the stock exchange. Based on the value traded in 2014, the commission earned by the brokerage firms in 2014 was estimated at USD 1.29bn. The commission earned by the brokerage firms is estimated to increase at a CAGR of 2% between 2014 and 2020 to reach USD 1.46bn in 2020. Tadawul is likely to witness increase in volume traded in the coming years which is attributable to regulatory liberalization permitting foreign investors to own shares traded on exchange. However, similar to the investor&rsquo;s response in 2015, the trading activity is expected to be lean during 2016 due to continued lower oil prices.<br />
<br />
<img alt="Chart-2.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KSA-Brokerage-Industry-fig2.jpg" style="width: 538px; height: 341px;" title="Chart-2.jpg" /><br />
<br />
The brokerage firms in KSA are dependent on the buying and selling of equities for revenue generation. Absence or miniscule presence of other products such as ETFs, mutual funds, commodities and derivatives limit the opportunity of revenue generation from these products. Additionally, the restriction on short selling limits the potential for the brokerage firms to earn revenue from these transactions. Increasing the basket of products offered by the brokerage firms increases the revenue generation avenues.&nbsp; Additionally decreasing stock turnover, underdeveloped corporate governance regulations compared to developed markets and lack of institutional participation are some of the key challenges hindering the growth of the equity capital markets in Saudi Arabia and in turn impacting the brokerage industry&rsquo;s revenue.<br />
&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">All brokerage firms provide research support; however, most of them have limited their offerings to periodic reports (daily, monthly or quarterly) and equity research reports. Since availability of information related to the stocks and industry is a major challenge, as only 49.7% (Marmore estimates) of the stocks listed on the Tadawul exchange are covered by the analysts. Brokerages firms may further enhance their research offering as presence of reliable information increases confidence of retail and institutional investors. This will result in increased participation of investors in the equity markets and ultimately benefitting the brokerage industry.<br />
&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Strong IPO activity, a possible MSCI re-classification from standalone market to emerging market, Tadawul&rsquo;s liberalization to let foreigners buy shares directly and CMA&rsquo;s proactive strategy to build a stronger regulatory framework are some of the opportunities that the KSA brokerage industry is likely to benefit from.</div>[:ar]<div style="text-align: justify;">Saudi stock market is dominated by the top 10 brokerage firms contributing approximately 90% of the value traded.

<img alt="Chart-1.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KSA-Brokerage-Industry-fig1.jpg" style="width: 645px; height: 394px;" title="Chart-1.jpg" />
<div style="text-align: justify;">The Saudi Brokerage industry is regulated by Capital Market Authority (CMA). The CMA only specifies a minimum and maximum brokerage that can be charged by the brokers and offers the brokers the freedom of discounts on the commission in order to attract the clients. The commission charged by the brokerage firms in Saudi Arabia is set at maximum of 0.12% of the value traded by the stock exchange. Based on the value traded in 2014, the commission earned by the brokerage firms in 2014 was estimated at USD 1.29bn. The commission earned by the brokerage firms is estimated to increase at a CAGR of 2% between 2014 and 2020 to reach USD 1.46bn in 2020. Tadawul is likely to witness increase in volume traded in the coming years which is attributable to regulatory liberalization permitting foreign investors to own shares traded on exchange. However, similar to the investor&rsquo;s response in 2015, the trading activity is expected to be lean during 2016 due to continued lower oil prices.<br />
<br />
<img alt="Chart-2.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KSA-Brokerage-Industry-fig2.jpg" style="width: 538px; height: 341px;" title="Chart-2.jpg" /><br />
<br />
The brokerage firms in KSA are dependent on the buying and selling of equities for revenue generation. Absence or miniscule presence of other products such as ETFs, mutual funds, commodities and derivatives limit the opportunity of revenue generation from these products. Additionally, the restriction on short selling limits the potential for the brokerage firms to earn revenue from these transactions. Increasing the basket of products offered by the brokerage firms increases the revenue generation avenues.&nbsp; Additionally decreasing stock turnover, underdeveloped corporate governance regulations compared to developed markets and lack of institutional participation are some of the key challenges hindering the growth of the equity capital markets in Saudi Arabia and in turn impacting the brokerage industry&rsquo;s revenue.<br />
&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">All brokerage firms provide research support; however, most of them have limited their offerings to periodic reports (daily, monthly or quarterly) and equity research reports. Since availability of information related to the stocks and industry is a major challenge, as only 49.7% (Marmore estimates) of the stocks listed on the Tadawul exchange are covered by the analysts. Brokerages firms may further enhance their research offering as presence of reliable information increases confidence of retail and institutional investors. This will result in increased participation of investors in the equity markets and ultimately benefitting the brokerage industry.<br />
&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Strong IPO activity, a possible MSCI re-classification from standalone market to emerging market, Tadawul&rsquo;s liberalization to let foreigners buy shares directly and CMA&rsquo;s proactive strategy to build a stronger regulatory framework are some of the opportunities that the KSA brokerage industry is likely to benefit from.</div>[:]]]></Content>

		<Title>[:en]KSA Residential Real Estate - Transactions Review (Q3 2015)[:ar]العقارات السكنية للمملكة العربية السعودية - مراجعة المعاملات (الربع الثالث 2015)[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">During the past decade, Saudi Arabia has witnessed rapid economic development, attributable to elevated oil production and prices, vigorous private sector activity and strong government spending on infrastructure, health, and education. The nominal GDP of KSA grew from USD 754.6bn in 2013 to USD 761.9bn in 2014, and is projected to reach USD 791.6bn in 2016. High population growth coupled with rise in per capita income has fuelled the demand for residential units in the Kingdom, especially in Riyadh and Jeddah. Government&rsquo;s focus has shifted towards the housing shortage in the country, as a result of the increasing growth to the population.<br />
<br />
Due to this, strong supply is expected from projects undertaken by the local government agencies. According to Marmore&rsquo;s report on KSA Residential Real Estate, The Ministry of Housing is developing 15,000 units (handover in 2017) and 15,500 more units being planned. The Ministry of Housing is developing its first project in Riyadh, which includes 675 apartments and 2,200 land plots, which is expected to increase the supply of affordable housing, as a large proportion of the population still does not own a house in KSA. But, demand for residential real estate is expected to be relatively low due to the new mortgage policy, which has reduced the amount of loan permitted on a property. Increasing land prices, lack of construction finance and availability of land, constrain supply especially in affordable housing and middle-income housing segments. As a result a significant percentage of middle-income households choose to rent rather than purchase property. On the other hand, rising income levels and changing lifestyles has led to increase in supply of luxury high-rise residential units, with greater focus on &ldquo;modern luxury&rdquo;. But the combination of low interest rates and continued fiscal stimulus has raised concerns of potential asset bubbles, especially in the property markets, with the bank lending to real estate increasing by 31 per cent in 2014.<br />
<br />
Value of construction contracts awarded in the first half of 2015 stood at USD 37bn, and despite lower oil price the contracts were awarded at a faster pace in 2015, compared to 2014. Residential real estate, roads, power and healthcare were the primary sectors accounting for close to two-thirds of the total awarded contracts, while Riyadh region captured the lion&rsquo;s share of awarded contracts. Construction activity also seems to have peaked, with the demand for cement rising at double digits over the last five years.<br />
&nbsp;</div>

<h4 class="reasearchcontentheading" style="text-align: justify;">Real Estate Transactions</h4>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><br />
In Riyadh, the total value of residential transaction appear to have experienced a YoY decline of around 32.5% in Q3 2015, and a QoQ decline of 17 per cent. A similar pattern is seen in the total number of residential deals, where a 8 per cent YoY decline was recorded for Q3 2015, alongside a QoQ decline of 10.5 per cent. Similarly, in Makkah the number of residential transactions declined YoY by 24 per cent, and QoQ by 25 per cent, whereas the value of residential transactions declined 27.4 per cent YoY and 50.3 per cent QoQ in Q3 2015.<br />
<br />
The number of transactions continued to decline due to the new mortgage law, which limits the maximum loan amount to 70 per cent of the property value. Average price per sq m experienced quarterly decline in all three major cities; average price per sqm for land in Riyadh declined 27 per cent YoY, followed by decline of 25 per cent in Jeddah.<br />
<br />
These declines accompany a decline in total number of transactions indicating that the sharp drop in recorded prices is not sustainable and are set to adjust after the bottleneck clears, which can only be fueled by liquidity, in the form of credit availability, and a rise in affordability. Only then will the market adjust to fair and long term sustainable values with less volatility.&nbsp;</div>

		<Title>[:en]Emaar Properties - A STEEPLED Perspective[:ar]إعمار العقارية[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]Emaar properties PJSC was established in 1997 and has been listed as a Joint stock company on the Dubai Financial market.&nbsp; Emaar has helped in creating large scale master-planned communities as well as establishing competencies in the Hospitality & Leisure, Shopping Malls and Retail segment across the GCC region as well as in International markets. According to Marmore&rsquo;s report on Emaar Properties, Emaar Properties has been behind the development of some Dubai&rsquo;s iconic structure such as Downtown Dubai, Arabian ranches, Emirates living and the Dubai Marina. The Dubai Downtown project consists of the two iconic landmarks and tourist attractions in Dubai &ndash; the Burj Khalifa towers and The Dubai Mall.
<h4 class="reasearchcontentheading">STEEPLED Analysis</h4>
<br />
What is a STEEPLED Analysis?<br />
<br />
STEEPLED analysis is an extension of the famous PEST analysis. While the PEST analysis covers the Political, Economic, Social and Technological factors the STEEPLED version adds the environmental, legal, ethical and demographical factors into consideration. This analysis basically gives an overview of the different macro-environmental factors that the company has to take into consideration. It is a useful strategic tool for understanding market growth or decline, business position, potential and direction for operations.<br />
We analyse how Emaar Properties fare in the STEEPLED analysis<br />
<br />
<strong><em>Social - Good</em></strong><br />
The social factors vary from country to country within the region. But in general, Middle East has higher economic growth rate, younger population, and higher propensity to splurge on luxuries. With the governments providing various subsidies and taxes being on the lower side, disposable incomes are higher which makes the restaurant and retail sectors the prime beneficiaries. UAE has a very interesting social mix whereby close to 90% of their workforce and over 80% of the population are expatriates. Close to 75% of the population lays between the ages of 15-64, a sweet spot for increased consumption and real estate spending as people start to marry and settle down in their life.<br />
<br />
<strong><em>Technological - Good</em></strong><br />
Globally there are technological advances that are made in terms of building materials, passive/active solar energy cells; usage of biodegradable materials in construction etc., The Dubai Municipality has recently brought in the Green Building Regulations and Specifications which mandates the reduction in consumption of energy, water and minerals. The Unified Green Building code for GCC is expected to be drafted by this year and its implementation would be a great challenge as well as an opportunity for real estate players in the region. Implementing green standards would reduce the consumption of fossil fuels helping them to earn additional foreign exchange through sale of oil which would otherwise have been burned for power production.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong><em>Economics - Good</em></strong><br />
The GCC region collectively has one of the world&rsquo;s largest oil reserves. The slump in the oil prices is expected to leave a lasting impact on the economies of the region. Many countries in the GCC region have had budgetary surplus over the years which would allow them to sustain their spending for some years to come. However, UAE has been working on diversifying its economy in the past ten years which has currently borne fruit. Oil contributes to 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of UAE&rsquo;s GDP making it the most diversified country in the region. While the lower oil prices could have significant impact on revenues, UAE has enough buffers in the form of sovereign wealth funds and a relatively lower fiscal breakeven price compared to other major oil producers.<br />
<br />
<strong><em>Environmental- Neutral</em></strong><br />
GCC countries suffer from acute shortage of land and water. Real estate companies in the UAE should make an effort to reduce the wastage of water during the construction. UAE does not have any natural water source and entirely depends on desalination plants (close to 80% of water is supplied by 25 desalination plants). Incorporating water and energy saving requirements in construction of new buildings would help in reducing the environmental impact of the projects.<br />
<br />
<strong><em>Political- Good</em></strong><br />
The UAE is seen as a country with very less political risk in the Middle East. Although each state - Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Ajman, Fujairah, Ras al Khaimah, Sharjah and Umm al Qaiwain - maintains a large degree of independence, the UAE is governed by a Supreme Council of rulers made up of the seven emirs, who appoint the prime minister and the cabinet and an Elected Federal assembly which plays a consultative role. UAE also has a reputation of being one of the transparent and business friendly regimes in the region.<br />
<br />
<strong><em>Legal - Good</em></strong><br />
The Real Estate Regulatory Agency was established as a result of a law issued by the ruler of Dubai.&nbsp; An arm of the Dubai Land Department, RERA is responsible for regulating the real estate sector, helping in formulating sector&rsquo;s strategies, regulating the activities of companies that manage residential compounds, as well as the activities of real estate brokers and the Owners Associations.<br />
<br />
<strong><em>Ethics - Good</em></strong><br />
Developers in UAE who have come out strong from the real estate crisis in 2008/09 are set to benefit from the maturity in the market. Investors have shown their preference for players who have had a positive track record of delivering projects on time.<br />
<br />
<strong><em>Demographics - Good</em></strong><br />
Youthful, technologically aware demographics, with high per capita income are one of the major advantages of this region. Tourism is a major revenue generator in the region and as a result the benefit both hospitality and retail sectors.[:ar]Emaar properties PJSC was established in 1997 and has been listed as a Joint stock company on the Dubai Financial market.&nbsp; Emaar has helped in creating large scale master-planned communities as well as establishing competencies in the Hospitality & Leisure, Shopping Malls and Retail segment across the GCC region as well as in International markets.

		<Title>[:en]UAE Asset Management Industry - An Overview[:ar]صناعة إدارة الأصول في الإمارات العربية المتحدة - لمحة عامة[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]According to Marmore&rsquo;s UAE Asset Management report, the UAE asset management industry manages USD 1,264.8mn&nbsp;in assets in about 31 funds as of 21<sup>st</sup> July, 2015. In terms of products, equity funds lead the pack with 69% share, followed by specialized funds at 20%. Remainder of the assets is spread across money market and fixed income funds. Of the total assets, Islamic funds manage USD 435mn (34.4%) in assets and rest is conventional funds. In terms of the number of funds, there are 23 equity funds, 4 money market funds, 3 specialized funds and 1 fixed income fund.<br />
<br />
AUM/GDP ratio for the UAE stands at 0.5%, implying lack of mutual fund penetration as an investment option. The UAE asset management market is small in comparison to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.&nbsp; The top five asset managers (out of a total of 10) account for 75% of the total assets being managed; Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC leads the list of large asset management companies with USD 374mn in assets (29% market share), followed by Emirates NBD Asset Management Limited with USD 339mn in assets (26% share) and Abu Dhabi Investment Company with USD 153mn in assets (12% share).<br />
<br />
Analyzing total Assets under Management based on country wise geographical focus we find that UAE stands at 6th position with USD 1,264.8 Mn of AUM. Saudi Arabia is the dominant player in the MENA asset management industry.<br />
<br />
We look at the various participants in the UAE asset management market. They range from conventional and Islamic funds, Insurance companies, Pension funds and Sovereign wealth funds.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>AUM Break Up</strong><br />
<br />
Total AUM can be further subdivided into Conventional Funds amounting to USD 829.8 Mn and Islamic Funds amounting to USD 435 Mn.<br />
<br />
<strong>Figure 1: UAE Funds Break Up - Conventional and Islamic&nbsp;</strong><br />
<img alt="Figure1-UAE-Funds-Break-Up-Conventional-and-Islamic.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/UAE-Asset-Management-Industry-fig1.jpg" style="width: 407px; height: 216px;" title="Figure1-UAE-Funds-Break-Up-Conventional-and-Islamic.jpg" /><br />
<br />
Total AUM can be further subdidvided as Equity (USD 877.9mn), Fixed Income (USD 40.4mn) , Money Market (USD 92.3mn) and Specialized (USD 254mn).<br />
<br />
<strong>Figure 2: UAE Funds Break up - Asset Type<br />
<img alt="Figure2-UAEFundsBreakup-AssetType.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/UAE-Asset-Management-Industry-fig2.jpg" style="width: 568px; height: 183px;" title="Figure2-UAEFundsBreakup-AssetType.jpg" /></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Pension Funds</strong><br />
<br />
UAE lacks a fully developed private and employer managed pensions industry. The UAE&rsquo;s total retirement benefits are worth approximately USD 3Bn and are managed by two state providers &ndash; the General Pensions and Social Security Authority and the Abu Dhabi Retirement Pensions and Benefit Fund.<br />
<br />
<strong>Abu Dhabi Retirement Pensions and Benefit Fund</strong><br />
<br />
Abu Dhabi Retirement Pensions and Benefits Fund (ADRPBF) was founded in 2000 to manage contributions, pensions and end of service benefits for UAE nationals working in or retired from the government, semi- Government and private sectors in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, and their beneficiaries. The latest available annual report (2013) shows that the fund invests in more than 50 countries.<br />
<br />
<strong>The General Pensions and Social Security Authority</strong><br />
<br />
The principal activity is the administration of pension and social security insurance plans for the benefit of nationals in the government and private sectors. The authority was established in 1999.<br />
<br />
<strong>Insurance Companies</strong><br />
<br />
In terms of insurance penetration, total revenue and insurance density, the UAE is the leading country in the GCC region. In 2014, the UAE insurance industry produced over USD 6.29bn&nbsp; of insurance revenues. This makes UAE the largest insurance market in the GCC region. The UAE has presence of both large local groups (Oman Insurance, Abu Dhabi National & Salama) and foreign insurers (RSA, AXA, Zurich).<br />
<br />
<strong>Figure 3: GCC Insurance Penetration in 2014 (Premium as a % of GDP) (Total Business)*</strong><br />
<br />
<img alt="Figure3-GCC-Insurance-Penetration-2014.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/UAE-Asset-Management-Industry-fig3.jpg" style="width: 486px; height: 242px;" title="Figure3-GCC-Insurance-Penetration-2014.jpg" /><br />
<br />
<br />
The investment mix of insurance companies since 2010 shows 30% of funds allocated to high risk / high return investment especially shares out of total 60% of the funds allocated in shares and bonds. The recovery of the stock markets, the high returns generated in 2013 by the stock markets in Dubai and the inclusion into the MSCI emerging markets have increased the investor confidence.<br />
<br />
<strong>Sovereign Wealth Funds</strong><br />
<br />
There are 7 Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) operating in the UAE . The oldest and the largest fund by asset size is Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA). The fund was established in 1976 and has a size of USD 773bn as of July 2015 . The main funding source of the fund is from financial surplus generated through oil exports. ADIA is also the largest sovereign wealth fund in the Middle East. It is wholly owned and subject to supervision by the government of Abu Dhabi. Emirates Investment Authority (EIA) is the first federal sovereign wealth fund for all seven states comprising the UAE.<br />
<br />
<strong>Foreign Investors</strong><br />
<br />
The revised UAE commercial company&rsquo;s law draft has been approved by the UAE Federal National Council, as announced on 28 May 2013. The status quo in relation to the foreign ownership limit has been maintained. Existing requirement is for the UAE companies to be owned at least 51% by UAE nationals and foreign ownership is restricted up to 49%. Hence, foreign investor&rsquo;s participation is currently restricted in the UAE companies. However, companies which are established in UAE free zones are permitted to be 100% foreign owned but are subject to certain trading restrictions of which investors should be aware . Companies listed on NASDAQ Dubai have no foreign ownership restrictions.<br />
<br />
<strong>Retail Participation</strong><br />

UAE&nbsp; equity market is dominated by retail participants and they account for the bulk of trading activity. While, ultra high net worth individuals (UHNI&rsquo;s) are a niche group who are predominantly served by private bankers, retail clients are a polarized group who either trade aggresively or shun markets altogether and invest in bank deposits. Analysing the data for the recent past indicate dominance of individual participants in the total value traded. Individual particpation was 57.9% in the total value traded of Dubai Financial Market. Individual participation was 65.5% in the total value traded of Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (May 2015). The individual participation has declined in both the Dubai and Abu Dhabi stock markets compared to 2012 when it more than 70% in&nbsp; both Dubai and Abu Dhabi markets.[:ar]According to Marmore&rsquo;s UAE Asset Management report, the UAE asset management industry manages USD 1,264.8mn&nbsp;in assets in about 31 funds as of 21<sup>st</sup> July, 2015. In terms of products, equity funds lead the pack with 69% share, followed by specialized funds at 20%. Remainder of the assets is spread across money market and fixed income funds. Of the total assets, Islamic funds manage USD 435mn (34.4%) in assets and rest is conventional funds. In terms of the number of funds, there are 23 equity funds, 4 money market funds, 3 specialized funds and 1 fixed income fund.<br />
<br />
AUM/GDP ratio for the UAE stands at 0.5%, implying lack of mutual fund penetration as an investment option. The UAE asset management market is small in comparison to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.&nbsp; The top five asset managers (out of a total of 10) account for 75% of the total assets being managed; Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC leads the list of large asset management companies with USD 374mn in assets (29% market share), followed by Emirates NBD Asset Management Limited with USD 339mn in assets (26% share) and Abu Dhabi Investment Company with USD 153mn in assets (12% share).<br />
<br />
Analyzing total Assets under Management based on country wise geographical focus we find that UAE stands at 6th position with USD 1,264.8 Mn of AUM. Saudi Arabia is the dominant player in the MENA asset management industry.<br />
<br />
We look at the various participants in the UAE asset management market. They range from conventional and Islamic funds, Insurance companies, Pension funds and Sovereign wealth funds.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>AUM Break Up</strong><br />
<br />
Total AUM can be further subdivided into Conventional Funds amounting to USD 829.8 Mn and Islamic Funds amounting to USD 435 Mn.<br />

<br />
<strong>Pension Funds</strong><br />
<br />
UAE lacks a fully developed private and employer managed pensions industry. The UAE&rsquo;s total retirement benefits are worth approximately USD 3Bn and are managed by two state providers &ndash; the General Pensions and Social Security Authority and the Abu Dhabi Retirement Pensions and Benefit Fund.<br />
<br />
<strong>Abu Dhabi Retirement Pensions and Benefit Fund</strong><br />
<br />
Abu Dhabi Retirement Pensions and Benefits Fund (ADRPBF) was founded in 2000 to manage contributions, pensions and end of service benefits for UAE nationals working in or retired from the government, semi- Government and private sectors in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, and their beneficiaries. The latest available annual report (2013) shows that the fund invests in more than 50 countries.<br />
<br />
<strong>The General Pensions and Social Security Authority</strong><br />
<br />
The principal activity is the administration of pension and social security insurance plans for the benefit of nationals in the government and private sectors. The authority was established in 1999.<br />
<br />
<strong>Insurance Companies</strong><br />
<br />
In terms of insurance penetration, total revenue and insurance density, the UAE is the leading country in the GCC region. In 2014, the UAE insurance industry produced over USD 6.29bn&nbsp; of insurance revenues. This makes UAE the largest insurance market in the GCC region. The UAE has presence of both large local groups (Oman Insurance, Abu Dhabi National & Salama) and foreign insurers (RSA, AXA, Zurich).<br />

<br />
<br />
The investment mix of insurance companies since 2010 shows 30% of funds allocated to high risk / high return investment especially shares out of total 60% of the funds allocated in shares and bonds. The recovery of the stock markets, the high returns generated in 2013 by the stock markets in Dubai and the inclusion into the MSCI emerging markets have increased the investor confidence.<br />
<br />
<strong>Sovereign Wealth Funds</strong><br />
<br />
There are 7 Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) operating in the UAE . The oldest and the largest fund by asset size is Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA). The fund was established in 1976 and has a size of USD 773bn as of July 2015 . The main funding source of the fund is from financial surplus generated through oil exports. ADIA is also the largest sovereign wealth fund in the Middle East. It is wholly owned and subject to supervision by the government of Abu Dhabi. Emirates Investment Authority (EIA) is the first federal sovereign wealth fund for all seven states comprising the UAE.<br />
<br />
<strong>Foreign Investors</strong><br />
<br />
The revised UAE commercial company&rsquo;s law draft has been approved by the UAE Federal National Council, as announced on 28 May 2013. The status quo in relation to the foreign ownership limit has been maintained. Existing requirement is for the UAE companies to be owned at least 51% by UAE nationals and foreign ownership is restricted up to 49%. Hence, foreign investor&rsquo;s participation is currently restricted in the UAE companies. However, companies which are established in UAE free zones are permitted to be 100% foreign owned but are subject to certain trading restrictions of which investors should be aware . Companies listed on NASDAQ Dubai have no foreign ownership restrictions.<br />
<br />
<strong>Retail Participation</strong><br />
<br />
UAE&nbsp; equity market is dominated by retail participants and they account for the bulk of trading activity.

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]SABIC was established in 1976 by Royal decree, and is currently ranked amongst the world&rsquo;s largest petrochemicals manufacturer. According to Marmore&rsquo;s company report on SABIC, the petrochemical segment contributed over 86% to SABIC&rsquo;s revenue in 2014. The next big segment in terms of revenue is the minerals/metals segment, generating over 5% of the revenue.&nbsp; From 2010-14, the revenue from all the four business segments has grown at CAGR of 6%.<br />
<br />
<strong>Revenue &ndash; Remain flat post stellar numbers in 2011</strong><br />
<br />
The total revenue of SABIC has increased after 2009 as the global markets recovered post the 2008 recession. According to the Global Platts Petrochemical Index, petrochemical prices declined by 30% in 2014 compared to 2013 price levels. The primary reason for the drop in sales in 2014 is the decline in oil prices in the last quarter of 2014, resulting in drop in the petrochemical product prices. Revenues have continued to decline during the 1<sup>st</sup> 9 months of 2015, dropping by 20% YoY (2014 9M earnings $ 38,788 Mn). Drop in revenues was attributed to the drop in selling prices of the petrochemical and other products that the company sells. While the company has not officially stated a reason for the decline in the prices of its products, it can largely be attributed to the falling oil prices.<br />
<br />

<br />
The petrochemical and fertilizer segment contributed over 86% to SABIC&rsquo;s revenue in 2014. The next big segment in terms of revenue is the minerals/metals segment, generating over 6% of revenue. Throughout 2010 to 2014 petrochemical segment has generated revenue in excess of 80% of the company&rsquo;s total revenue. SABIC is focused to be the leading player in this segment of business and almost 70% of the plant capacity was utilized to manufacture products which are part of the petrochemical business. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
The operating profit margin of SABIC has witnessed a decline since 2011. Following record revenues in 2011 the operating profit margin reached 26% while in the subsequent years they were hovering between 22%-23% before falling to 20% in 2014. The Net profit margin has also followed a similar pattern. While the revenues for the 1<sup>st</sup> 9 months of 2015 fell by over 20% the net profit margin fared slightly better compared to the same period last year. Net profit for 2015 9M stands at 13.66% as against 13.11% during 2014 9M while the operating profit declined from 21.53% to 20.89% during the same period. The improvement in net profit margin could be attributed to the cost cutting that the company has managed during 2015.<br />

<strong>ROE (Return on Equity) &ndash; ROA (Return on Assets) &ndash; In line with Revenues</strong><br />
<br />
According to Marmore&rsquo;s company report on SABIC, both ROE and ROA trends have been consistent with SABIC&rsquo;s revenue. The ROE and ROA reached its peak in 2011 at 14.80% and 22.60%, respectively, before declining in 2012. Continued slow global economic growth in 2014, malaise in China (one the key markets for SABIC) and decline in product prices due to lower oil prices has reflected in the revenues and earnings of 2014. However, an increase in equity and a marginal increase in assets value in 2014 resulted in lower ROE and ROA relative to 2013. Though the likelihood of outperforming in the near to medium term are high due to the cyclical recovery and potential for structural recovery in its European operations and new investments in the pipeline, the lower oil prices resulting in lower products prices can be a major hindrance to the recovery.<br />

<strong>Share Performance</strong><br />
<br />
SABIC&rsquo;s share performance has seen wide swings this year. While the share price continued to increase during the 1<sup>st</sup> half of the year it started to decline in the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of the year largely due to the negative impact that the Chinese stock market had on global stock markets. SABIC reached its peak of 108.75 on 04<sup>th</sup> May 2015 before falling to a low of 72 on 24<sup>th</sup> Aug 2015. It ended at 82.25on Oct 28<sup>th</sup> 2015. The Saudi Stock index&rsquo;s performance has been even more underwhelming; TASI reached its peak of 9,834.39 on 30<sup>th</sup> April 2015 before falling to 7,024.6 on 24<sup>th</sup> August 2015. TASI ended at 7,118.42 on Oct 28<sup>th</sup> 2015. Year to date returns of SABIC and TASI has been negative at -2.1% and -14.6% respectively.<br />

Qatar banking sector has shown continuous growth in profits since 2010. The banking sector posted profits of USD 5.3bn recording a YoY growth of 11.7% in 2014. This is an improvement from the growth rate of 7.4% in 2013. Furthermore, loan loss provisions decreased and growth of interest and non-interest expenses slowed down, which contributed to the increase in net income of the banking sector.

The highest contribution of net income to the Qatar banking sector was from Qatar National Bank, amounting to USD 2.87bn which accounts for 54% of the total. In 2014, out of the 8 banks under that were analysed, Doha Bank and Al Khaliji Commercial Bank saw the lowest net income growth of 3.1% and 2.2% respectively, which was lower than the industry average of 11.7%, despite their loan growth of 18.3% and 29.9% respectively which was above the industry average 15.6%. A further study reveals that for the Doha Bank, it was the 38% increase in the loan loss provision, 3.1% NPL and only 5% increase in the interest income that led to lower profits.

According to Marmore’s report on Qatar banking, 90% of the profits were concentrated in the top 5 banks making it an uphill task for new entrants to enter into the market.

<strong>Loans - Qatar Islamic bank leads the pack in terms of growth numbers; Qatar National bank by absolute numbers</strong> After a sluggish loan growth between 2008 and 2010, credit growth picked up in 2011. In 2014, 16% growth was witnessed in loans. Loan growth in the Qatar banks started to recover in 2011 showing a loan growth of 33% from 15% in 2010. One of the major factors which drove loan growth in the Qatar banking sector in 2011 and 2012 was the increased lending to the public sector.

Qatar Islamic Bank reported a 30.4% YoY growth in net loans during 2014 against the industry credit growth of 15.6%. But in absolute terms the largest increase in loans amounting to USD 7.8bn is by Qatar National Bank which experienced a 9.1% loan growth, though lesser than the average of 15.6%.

		<Title>[:en]Saudi Mortgage Law: Anticipated Impact vs. Ground Realties[:ar]قانون الرهن العقاري السعودي: التأثير المتوقع مقابل الواقع الحالي[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]Until the issuance of the Mortgage Law (prior to 2012), the finance sector regulations in Saudi Arabia, in particular the home finance segment was underdeveloped. The lenders were hesitant to provide financing due to ambiguous regulations and challenges associated with enforcing their rights. These risks added to the costs of financing making it expensive for the borrowers. The traditional practice followed by the Saudi banks was to offer home buying loans primarily secured by banks’ automatic deduction of loan repayments from borrowers’ salaries unlike mortgages which are secured by the properties being acquired. During the absence of the mortgage law the banks held the title of the real estate as collateral for the term of the loan. However, this scenario is anticipated to change with the implementation of the mortgage law.

<strong>Mortgage Law in Brief:</strong>
The real estate mortgage law, introduced in 2012, is a collective package of five different laws comprising:
<ul>
 	<li>The Real Estate Finance Law: The law addresses the authority of SAMA in regulating the real estate mortgage market, facilitation of refinancing via structured finance and securitization, and provision of additional liquidity support by the government.</li>
 	<li>The Mortgage Law: This law introduces the new regulatory framework of being able to mortgage the real estate without taking title by the financiers and also avail second-ranking mortgages.</li>
 	<li>The Finance Lease Law: This law deals with Finance Lease Contracts in general and extends beyond leases provided regarding real estate to leases of immovable or movable assets, utilities, services, or other rights such as intellectual property.</li>
 	<li>The Finance Companies Law: Regulates the incorporation, activities, and governance of finance companies to provide financing including but not limited to, real estate finance, general leasing finance, finance of credit cards and consumer finance in a Shariah compliant manner.</li>
 	<li>The Execution Law: Expands a judicial court's authority to provide injunctive and declaratory judgement and enforce such orders.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Anticipated Impact</strong>

Mortgage penetration rate (mortgage debt as a percentage of GDP) in Saudi Arabia is at 2%, compared to 5-10% in the neighbouring GCC countries. In contrast, developed countries like the US and UK, have mortgage penetration rates of more than 70%. The mortgage law was expected to strengthen the Saudi mortgage market by providing greater comfort to mortgagees when lending, transform the home financing in Saudi Arabia to property-secured lending from the existing practice of extending loans based on salary assignment. At the same time, make affordable residential housing finance available for its citizens.

The total loan extended by banks to real estate segment which includes retail and corporate lending was at USD 14.3bn at the end of 2009.  However, it grew at a CAGR of 22.6% during the 2009-2014 periods to reach USD 39.7bn. The retail lending grew at a higher CAGR of 27.3% compared to corporate lending which grew at a CAGR of 16.5% during the same 2009-2014 periods. The changes were expected to increase residential lending to about USD32 billion annually. The residential financing market size estimated at USD 35bn between 2014 and 2019 prior to the implementation of the mortgage law, is expected to increase by 60% over the same period and to be valued at USD 56bn with the implementation of the mortgage law.

The enabling of refinancing via securitization and government support in the form of loans and long-term deposits to avoid asset-liability mismatch would increase the liquidity in the mortgage banking system and resulting in higher/easier disbursement of mortgage financing to the potential home buyers.

The Government employees were the main beneficiaries, accounting for almost 85% of Saudi home loans market and remaining coming from government owned private entities during the pre-mortgage law practice of ensuring the lender is paid prior to the borrower receiving the salary. With the implementation of the new law, self-employed and lower income individuals under the monthly income bracket of SAR 6,000 – 9,000 were expected to be included as target audience. And thus, the demand for the number of home units, that will require financing over the next 5 years, expected to increase by 60%. The increased demand for housing especially the lower unit price houses due to affordability was expected to exert upward pressure on prices unless the supply increases to meet the increased demand.

<strong>Ground Reality</strong>

The initial impact of the mortgage law was positive during Q2 2012, achieving fastest growth of home lending compared to the previous four years. Mortgage lending during Q2 2012 increased by 83% to reach USD 12.8bn compared to Q2 2011. However, the mortgage lending market wasn’t able to sustain this growth in lending for long. By the end of 2014, the new mortgage laws in Saudi Arabia had resulted in shift from owning to leasing the properties. This shift in demand from buying to leasing the residential properties has caused sale prices to either remain stagnant and also decrease in some markets, at the same time has led to an increase in the lease rates.

As per JLL estimates, the sales price of residential units in Jeddah increased more than rentals compared to 2013 during the first 3 quarters of 2014. However, the trend reversed in the Q4 of 2014; with 3.2% decline in average apartment sales price and 9.3% increase in the rents. The shift in demand for renting of residential properties compared to purchase is attributable to the mortgage regulations restricting loan-to-value (LTV) ratio to a maximum of 70%.

The Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) regulation of loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of 70% for mortgages was aimed at preventing a collapse in the local housing market by averting a move towards over-indebtedness. However, this turned out to be an impediment, curbing the demand and pricing out the potential buyers who are unable to afford 30% down payment.

<em>Source: Various, Marmore Research, Assumptions: Price per sq. feet – Apartment (SAR 3000), Villa (SAR 4500), Tenure – 20yrs, Interest rate 4.25%</em>

Based on the norms imposed by SAMA restricting the consumer’s credit to a maximum of 33% of monthly salary, the average monthly salary required to purchase a basic apartment is SAR 49,257. To steer the mortgage market and increase the levels of ownership which is around 30% at present, the mortgage legislation should allow lenders to access lower-income segments of the markets. Since the existing home financing infrastructure is stable with lower levels of default rate estimated at 2% and common practice of prepayment, the maximum LTV of 70% has to be reconsidered. However, since most of the borrowers purchase the house to live rather than investment, the increase in the rentals rate is likely to play the part of convincing the customers to consider home purchase rather than leasing as mortgage financing is an investment, whereas renting is an expense.[:ar]Until the issuance of the Mortgage Law (prior to 2012), the finance sector regulations in Saudi Arabia, in particular the home finance segment was underdeveloped. The lenders were hesitant to provide financing due to ambiguous regulations and challenges associated with enforcing their rights. These risks added to the costs of financing making it expensive for the borrowers. The traditional practice followed by the Saudi banks was to offer home buying loans primarily secured by banks’ automatic deduction of loan repayments from borrowers’ salaries unlike mortgages which are secured by the properties being acquired. During the absence of the mortgage law the banks held the title of the real estate as collateral for the term of the loan. However, this scenario is anticipated to change with the implementation of the mortgage law.

<strong>Mortgage Law in Brief:</strong>
The real estate mortgage law, introduced in 2012, is a collective package of five different laws comprising:
<ul>
 	<li>The Real Estate Finance Law: The law addresses the authority of SAMA in regulating the real estate mortgage market, facilitation of refinancing via structured finance and securitization, and provision of additional liquidity support by the government.</li>
 	<li>The Mortgage Law: This law introduces the new regulatory framework of being able to mortgage the real estate without taking title by the financiers and also avail second-ranking mortgages.</li>
 	<li>The Finance Lease Law: This law deals with Finance Lease Contracts in general and extends beyond leases provided regarding real estate to leases of immovable or movable assets, utilities, services, or other rights such as intellectual property.</li>
 	<li>The Finance Companies Law: Regulates the incorporation, activities, and governance of finance companies to provide financing including but not limited to, real estate finance, general leasing finance, finance of credit cards and consumer finance in a Shariah compliant manner.</li>
 	<li>The Execution Law: Expands a judicial court's authority to provide injunctive and declaratory judgement and enforce such orders.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Anticipated Impact</strong>

Mortgage penetration rate (mortgage debt as a percentage of GDP) in Saudi Arabia is at 2%, compared to 5-10% in the neighbouring GCC countries. In contrast, developed countries like the US and UK, have mortgage penetration rates of more than 70%. The mortgage law was expected to strengthen the Saudi mortgage market by providing greater comfort to mortgagees when lending, transform the home financing in Saudi Arabia to property-secured lending from the existing practice of extending loans based on salary assignment. At the same time, make affordable residential housing finance available for its citizens.

The total loan extended by banks to real estate segment which includes retail and corporate lending was at USD 14.3bn at the end of 2009.  However, it grew at a CAGR of 22.6% during the 2009-2014 periods to reach USD 39.7bn.

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]According to a Ifri-Markaz report published in 2012 called ‘<strong>Powering Kuwait into the 21st Century: Alternatives for Power Generation</strong>’, it was pointed out that the GCC region is facing gas shortages and Kuwait ranks independency of supply among its policy priorities, renewable, and in particular solar have their own place in the power mix. The paper also called for further fleshing out the renewable energies target in Kuwait with more specifics. Moreover, the concept was highlighted that the gradual introduction and commercialization of renewable energies could help support a strategy to diminish power subsidies over future years.

With rapid developments taking place in the solar energy sphere in the GCC, now is the time to make sure that such policy recommendations are pursued with more vigour. The window of opportunity could otherwise be closed for some more time, as the dampening of international oil prices is causing some turbulence in the development of the renewable energies sector on the international scene.

Over the past several decades, the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries have depended on oil as the main source of national income and for powering the domestic economy. However, with the growing need for more power, domestically, and with the imperative of growing industries for economic diversification, there is the need to diversify away from the use of oil into renewables in the interest of sustainability. A key driver supporting the push towards renewables, particularly solar energy, is the rapid slide of prices in solar generation costs.

There are increasing instances of solar power projects in the GCC. For instance, as part of its energy diversification objectives for 2030, Dubai (the UAE) launched the HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in 2012. The park commenced with a 13MW solar PV facility in 2013 and targets to generate 1,000 MW by the middle of 2017. In Qatar, the Qatar Solar Energy company launched a solar-panel factory in 2014, which has the ability to generate 300mw of energy every year. The plan is to ultimately reach a production level of 2.5GW annually. Kuwait and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are also reportedly planning large solar power projects in order to diversify the energy mix. The long-term trend points to the fact that solar energy will play an integral role in the energy diversification agenda. The following figure provides the energy mix strategy of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy (DSCE) with respect to 2030.

Over the past five years, the costs of solar Photovoltaics (PV) modules and systems have declined by about 65–70%. This has reduced solar’s levelized cost of electricity (LCoE) dramatically. In areas with high solar-irradiation, the cost of generation of solar energy is now about $100/MWh. Thus, solar energy’s competitiveness has improved, which makes it a far more affordable proposition for countries in the GCC, in terms of developing the market without resorting to expensive subsidies.

There is little doubt among many experts that the GCC region can prove very competitive in terms of solar energy generation costs. For instance, in Saudi Arabia, it is possible to achieve a solar LCoE of around $70/MWh in the higher irradiation/elevation areas in the western parts of the Kingdom. In the areas close to the Gulf with respect to the Kingdom, the LCoE can reach about $90/MWh, which is still quite competitive in comparison with the international benchmark of $100/MWh. Some GCC countries have ambitious renewable energy plans, in which solar energy will play a key role. However, it should be noted that the objectives can vary in consistency across the region. Kuwait has renewable energy targets, which incline upwards in a phased manner, ranging from 1% (mix undefined) renewables-based power generation by 2015 to 10% (~ 7.7 GW) by 2030, and 15% by 2030.

Governments in the GCC are taking proactive steps to push the adoption rates for solar energy. This is evident in the case of Kuwait, where in May 2015, it was announced that the Ministry of State for Planning and Development was studying a proposal to oblige all cooperative societies in Kuwait to use renewable energy. As part of the plan, PV systems would be used in cooperative societies, thus saving energy and money, apart from safeguarding the environment. From the UAE, reports emerged in May 2015 that the fall in the cost of the country’s solar powered energy sources has achieved parity with cost of fossil fuels, making solar economical and commercially viable for the UAE.

There are also reports of important breakthroughs in research in terms of solar that are coming out of the GCC. For instance, in June 2015, the Qatar Environment and Energy Research Institute (QEERI) claimed that it has discovered the chemical mix of a new material that could render the harvesting of solar energy far more economical. According to scientific experts in Qatar, solar irradiation supplies the country with the yearly equivalent of 1.5 million barrels of oil per square kilometer. However, much of these remains underutilized or wasted due to the relatively high cost of harvesting the latent energy, thus making it an unattractive proposition for traditional energy players. However, with new research outputs coming from domestic institutions, Qatar expects to take rapid forward steps in terms of actualizing solar energy generation on an industrial scale. Meanwhile, Oman is studying a plan to establish four solar power projects, as pilot ventures, as proposed by the Rural Areas Electricity Company (Raeco). The following table provides the locations and the capacity of the planned solar projects in Oman.

The GCC could also take note of the developments in other parts of the Middle East in terms of renewable energies, especially solar in particular. Countries like Jordan and Egypt have recently created legislations that provide a framework for renewable energy projects. Such measures are intended to provide a layer of government backing for large scale renewable energy projects, which may include steps like guaranteed tariffs for generated power and governmental guarantees for project developers.

The following figure provides the energy mix strategy of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy (DSCE) with respect to 2030.

Over the past five years, the costs of solar Photovoltaics (PV) modules and systems have declined by about 65–70%. This has reduced solar’s levelized cost of electricity (LCoE) dramatically. In areas with high solar-irradiation, the cost of generation of solar energy is now about $100/MWh. Thus, solar energy’s competitiveness has improved, which makes it a far more affordable proposition for countries in the GCC, in terms of developing the market without resorting to expensive subsidies.

There is little doubt among many experts that the GCC region can prove very competitive in terms of solar energy generation costs. For instance, in Saudi Arabia, it is possible to achieve a solar LCoE of around $70/MWh in the higher irradiation/elevation areas in the western parts of the Kingdom. In the areas close to the Gulf with respect to the Kingdom, the LCoE can reach about $90/MWh, which is still quite competitive in comparison with the international benchmark of $100/MWh. Some GCC countries have ambitious renewable energy plans, in which solar energy will play a key role. However, it should be noted that the objectives can vary in consistency across the region. Kuwait has renewable energy targets, which incline upwards in a phased manner, ranging from 1% (mix undefined) renewables-based power generation by 2015 to 10% (~ 7.7 GW) by 2030, and 15% by 2030.

Governments in the GCC are taking proactive steps to push the adoption rates for solar energy. This is evident in the case of Kuwait, where in May 2015, it was announced that the Ministry of State for Planning and Development was studying a proposal to oblige all cooperative societies in Kuwait to use renewable energy. As part of the plan, PV systems would be used in cooperative societies, thus saving energy and money, apart from safeguarding the environment. From the UAE, reports emerged in May 2015 that the fall in the cost of the country’s solar powered energy sources has achieved parity with cost of fossil fuels, making solar economical and commercially viable for the UAE.

There are also reports of important breakthroughs in research in terms of solar that are coming out of the GCC. For instance, in June 2015, the Qatar Environment and Energy Research Institute (QEERI) claimed that it has discovered the chemical mix of a new material that could render the harvesting of solar energy far more economical. According to scientific experts in Qatar, solar irradiation supplies the country with the yearly equivalent of 1.5 million barrels of oil per square kilometer. However, much of these remains underutilized or wasted due to the relatively high cost of harvesting the latent energy, thus making it an unattractive proposition for traditional energy players. However, with new research outputs coming from domestic institutions, Qatar expects to take rapid forward steps in terms of actualizing solar energy generation on an industrial scale. Meanwhile, Oman is studying a plan to establish four solar power projects, as pilot ventures, as proposed by the Rural Areas Electricity Company (Raeco). The following table provides the locations and the capacity of the planned solar projects in Oman.

The GCC could also take note of the developments in other parts of the Middle East in terms of renewable energies, especially solar in particular. Countries like Jordan and Egypt have recently created legislations that provide a framework for renewable energy projects. Such measures are intended to provide a layer of government backing for large scale renewable energy projects, which may include steps like guaranteed tariffs for generated power and governmental guarantees for project developers.

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]Offsets, in defense and civil trade, are essentially compensations that a procuring government or buyer seeks from the seller for the purchase of goods and/or services. A practice that originated in the 1950s, offsets have grown in stature over the years and is now evident in about 120 countries around the world, from a mere 20 from approximately 25 years ago.<br />
<br />
According to Marmore&rsquo;s report on <strong style="line-height: 1.6;">GCC Offsets</strong>, there are broadly two classes of offset programmes, i.e., Direct Offsets (DOs) and Indirect Offsets (IOs). DOs are usually in the form of coproduction, subcontracting, etc.; while IOs involve measures such as investments or skills training programmes that are sponsored by the obligor.<br />
<br />
Offsets can provide significant opportunities to foster innovation. For instance, South Korea&rsquo;s assessment parameters, in terms of bidders for its F-X III fighter programme, weighted offsets and technology-transfer at 17% of the total evaluation score; while acquisition costs accounted for only 15%. In search for economic competitive advantage through the processes of the knowledge economy, nations are increasingly expected to turn to offsets for technology transfer of advanced manufacturing skills. An example includes the recent move by India towards finalising a DOs policy that will mandate foreign contractors to establish manufacturing bases in India as part of the nation&rsquo;s &#39;Make in India&#39; campaign.<br />
<br />
Despite the apparently conflicting interests of the sellers and procurers in the defense offsets industry, a focus on a &lsquo;win-win&rsquo; approach can unlock mutual value. Offsets, if used strategically, can allow a procuring country to develop progress towards expertise in sophisticated manufacturing and allied services, leading to economic transformation in terms of capabilities over a period of time. A case in point is South Korea, which through its Defense Reform Plan 2020 (enacted in 2005), focused attention on a self-reliant defense manufacturing posture through enhancing indigenous capabilities and raising defense R&D spend.<br />
<br />
Using a sophisticated policy framework to direct offsets has allowed South Korea to develop the nation&rsquo;s private defense industry aggressively. The country&rsquo;s few large industrial conglomerates (chaebols), like Samsung and Hyundai, have profited from technologies transfer in terms of arms production. This has allowed them to develop diversified industrial manufacturing capabilities, allowing them to spread their business enterprises throughout many parts of the world via multiple innovations in areas like smartphones, automobiles, construction of refineries, etc. However, developing expansive manufacturing expertise and fostering an ecosystem of innovation requires a policy of a determined step-by-step development plan on the part of the procuring countries.<br />

Offset arrangements can allow local supply chains to take shape in procuring countries. For instance, in June 2015, Brazil announced that it would receive $9.1 billion in the form of offset arrangements as part of Brazil purchasing the Saab (Sweden) Gripen NG fighter planes. Several Brazilian companies (such as Akaer, Embraer, etc.) will receive the offsets. For instance, Akaer will support development of structural components and composite materials for the Gripen NG fighter planes purchase programme; while another Brazilian company, called Mectron, will hold the mandate for integrating weapon systems. Also, reports indicated that a total of 250 Brazilian scientists, engineers, and technicians could be sent to Sweden for training purposes, and for enhancing their knowledge of fighter aircraft technologies. These developments, together, could provide for Brazil a strong ecosystem for developing its own aviation technologies cluster.<br />
<br />
For many countries in the GCC, offsets are an effective platform for furthering efforts on job creation, technology transfer and training for nationals. The Tawazun Economic Council, which oversees the UAE&rsquo;s offset programme, was instrumental in Boeing (the U.S.-based plane manufacturer) joining hands with the UAE-based Tawazun Precision Industries (TPI) for commencing the construction of a new metallic parts treatment facility, in Abu Dhabi, in June 2015. The programme will infuse a new aerospace manufacturing capability in the UAE, and will be the first such industrial capacity in the GCC region.<br />
<br />
There are other successful case studies from the UAE in terms of innovation and economic diversification through offsets. In June 2015, it was announced that Strata, a Mubadala-owned company that is based in Al Ain (the UAE), will manufacture parts worth $80 million for Airbus in 2015 as part of offset agreements. It is expected that Strata will go on to manufacture composite parts for the A350 and A320 by 2020. Many analysts are pointing out that the defense industry is allowing the UAE to develop a sophisticated industrial base through the medium of offsets. Tactical and strategic use of offsets is allowing UAE companies to perform in various fields such as vehicle manufacturing, repair and overhaul, geospatial mapping, etc. The Enigma Armoured Modular Fighting Vehicle, which was unveiled in February 2015, by the Abu Dhabi-based Emirates Defense Technology (EDT) is a case in point.<br />
<br />
In order for offsets to support thriving of innovation, a complete ecosystem of private and public sector institutions is needed. The ecosystem should allow synergies and networks to develop between various elements like technology acquisition, application oriented R&D, passionate and skilled workforce, favorable regulations, strong intellectual property regime, etc. Also, the offset policy should be clearly tailored to national circumstances. For instance, not all countries will require a very robust defense industry due to a relaxed security environment, in which case offsets can be directed into non-defense related industrial sectors more readily. This means that a procuring country&rsquo;s offset policy should be clear about defining the sectors of focus in a precise manner, concentrated efforts in areas where the country already has or can build credible competitive advantage that is sustainable.<br />
<br />
According to experts and analysts, the world has entered into the age of the &ldquo;fourth industrial revolution&rdquo; (Industry 4.0). The first industrial revolution was sparked by introduction of machines in the 18th century. The arrival of electricity stimulated mass production, creating the second industrial revolution during the early part of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. The 1970s saw the third wave of industrialization through automation. Currently, the pervasiveness of the internet, mobile devices and cloud computing, have aligned to disrupt and revolutionize manufacturing. Offsets can be used to leverage the trend of Industry 4.0 in terms of innovating in areas that show promise as the technologies of the present and the future.[:ar]Offsets, in defense and civil trade, are essentially compensations that a procuring government or buyer seeks from the seller for the purchase of goods and/or services.

		<Title>[:en]Foreign Ownership Laws in the GCC[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]With economic diversification and industrial growth becoming a key part of the reforms agenda in the GCC, there is much attention being focused on the foreign ownership regime across the bloc. This note will delve into the <b>foreign ownership laws in the GCC</b>, starting with Kuwait.

<strong>Kuwait:</strong>
In 2013, the Kuwaiti authorities issued the new Foreign Direct Investment Law (“FDI Law”) with respect to the promotion of direct investment in Kuwait. According to the new FDI Law, investments into Kuwait can take one of three forms:
<ol class="rdetails_list" style="text-align: left;">
 	<li>A Kuwaiti company with up to 100% foreign equity (previously restricted to 49%)</li>
 	<li>A branch of a foreign company licensed to operate in Kuwait for the purpose of direct investment</li>
 	<li>A representative office with the sole purpose of preparing market studies and production feasibilities, without engaging in a commercial activity or activity of commercial agents</li>
</ol>
Kuwait now follows the ‘Negative List’ approach, as per which investments into sectors outside the Negative List are eligible for 100% foreign ownership. Article 1 of Resolution 75 (2015) sets out the Negative List that includes ten different sectors into which investments by foreign entities are not permitted. As per Kuwait’s Negative List, the following direct investments shall be excluded from the scope of the 2013 FDI Law. They are:
<ul class="rdetails_list" style="text-align: left;">
 	<li>Extraction of crude petroleum</li>
 	<li>Extraction of natural gas</li>
 	<li>Manufacture of coke oven products</li>
 	<li>Manufacture of fertilizers and nitrogen compounds</li>
 	<li>Manufacture of gas; distribution of gaseous fuels through mains</li>
 	<li>Real Estate (excluding privately operated building development projects)</li>
 	<li>Security and investigation activities</li>
 	<li>Public administration and defense; compulsory social security</li>
 	<li>Activities of membership organizations</li>
</ul>
<strong><u>Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA)</u>: </strong>
With respect to the KSA, foreign investors may be allowed to own up to 100% of the capital of a company or enterprise depending upon the nature of the business activity. However, certain businesses have defined minimum Saudi ownership requirements. The following table lists out the requirements:

<strong><u>The United Arab Emirates (UAE)</u></strong>
In the case of the UAE, foreign investors cannot own more than 49% of any UAE firm or entity unless it is incorporated in a special "free zone". But, in the case of the free trade zones, 100% foreign ownership is possible. Recent media reports suggest that the UAE is at an advanced stage of drafting an upgraded foreign investment law that would permit 100% foreign ownership of businesses in some sectors outside free zones.

In March 2015, it was reported that a first draft of the law has been approved by a UAE Ministry of Justice committee, and the country’s Cabinet. After redrafting by the Ministry of Justice, it is expected to be sent to the Federal National Council and the Cabinet for approval. However, there has been no official confirmation with respect to which sectors could or would see a relaxation of the foreign ownership restrictions and with respect to the timeframe by when the law could be expected to be introduced.

<strong><u>Qatar</u></strong>:
For Qatar, foreign participation is allowed in all sectors, except in banking & insurance, commercial agency and real estate trading sectors. With respect to banking & insurance, permission may be obtained in case it is authorized by a decision of the Cabinet of Ministers. According to the Foreign Investment Law No. 13 of 2000, non-Qataris, whether juristic or natural persons, may invest in any sector of the Qatari economy only via the medium of a company incorporated in Qatar in which one or more Qatari nationals and/or 100% Qatari entities hold not less than 51% of the share capital.

Moreover, foreign investors, by virtue of a ministerial approval, can increase their investment from 49% to 100% if the entity works in the fields of agriculture, industry, health, education, tourism, development and use of natural resources, energy, mining, consultancy, technical works services, information technology, cultural, sports, entertainment and distribution services. Also, where it is considered that the projects are in line with the nation’s development plan (outside the aforementioned fields), foreign investors may be permitted to hold 100% of an entity’s capital, though the authorizations are conducted on a case-by-case basis.

With respect to investments into listed companies in Qatar, a law introduced in August 2014 allows foreign investors to own up to 49% of listed Qatari companies. The law also authorizes foreigners to hold more than 49% of a Qatari company in special cases if approval is obtained from the Qatari cabinet. Also notable is the fact that, citizens from the rest of the GCC will be considered as Qatari citizens for the purpose of owning companies listed on the Qatar Exchange.

<strong><u>Oman</u>: </strong>
In Oman, 100% foreign ownership is possible on a selective basis. Usually, an Omani partner must hold at least 51% ownership of the joint venture project, according to Article 7 of the Commercial Companies Code. The following lists the conditions or areas that allow 100% foreign ownership in Oman.
<ul class="rdetails_list" style="text-align: left;">
 	<li>Unites States-Oman Free Trade Agreement (can be 100% owned by U.S. investors without an Omani partner)</li>
 	<li>Free zones (e.g., Salalah Free Zone)</li>
 	<li>Knowledge Oasis Muscat (A technology park dedicated to Oman’s entrepreneurs, SMEs, multinational corporations and leading technical educational institutions)</li>
</ul>
<strong><u>Bahrain</u></strong>:
In Bahrain, a foreign investor may operate as a limited liability company, single-person company, closed joint stock company, branch office, regional office, or holding company. In Bahrain, 100% foreign ownership of business is allowed, though sector-specific and/or company type-specific restrictions may apply. Examples of sectors open to 100% foreign investment include technology, tourism, healthcare, education, manufacturing, and business services. Otherwise, foreign ownership may be limited to 49%. The following table summarizes the business activities prohibited in Bahrain and those business sectors that are open only to Bahraini citizens and companies.

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<strong>KEY QUESTION 1: Can you explain the market growth in the GCC region?</strong><br />
<br />
The GCC countries have been doing a lot better than both the developed and the emerging markets. The governments in the GCC region have been using oil revenues to develop various industries such as aviation, infrastructure, retail, health and education and thereby spurring strong growth in non-oil sectors. The success of GCC airlines at the global level stands testimony to this. <a href="http://www.emirates.com/kw/english/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Emirates Airways</a>, <a href="http://www.qatarairways.com/kw" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Qatar Airways</a> and <a href="http://www.etihad.com/en/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Etihad Airlines</a> have provided intense competition to their American and European rivals.<br />

<br />
<strong>Qatar National Vision 2030 & FIFA World Cup 2022</strong><br />
The National Vision 2030 Plan outlines spend of about USD 86bn to build roads, rail network, seaports and airport. About 40% is to be financed by the Government and the rest by Government entities. The investment opportunities will further broaden as Qatar is set to host the FIFA football World Cup tournament in 2022. This will result in spending not just restricted to stadium construction and upgradation but also in establishing hospitality centers, tourist spending and associated economic activities. All this will add 1-1.5% to GDP value according to a Marmore Report on FIFA World Cup 2022, written in April 2013. While stadiums will come up at USD 3 billion, expansion of the road network (USD 27.5bn) and building the fully automated metro system and long-distance railway network (USD 41bn) could make Qatar an attractive business destination.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Kuwait Developmental Plan 2015-2020</strong><br />
A new Kuwait Development Plan (KDP) for 2015-2020 was announced in August 2014, with a focus on implementation of several long-stalled mega strategic projects. This will address the imbalances of economic reforms and require the private sector to play a bigger role in realizing the country&rsquo;s strategic vision through the implementation of mega projects.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
According to the Marmore report on KDP 2015-2020, some of the highlights are:
<ul>
	<li>521 projects will be executed over the next five years &nbsp;</li>
	<li>Construction and Development of the Metro rail project</li>
	<li>Developing another rail network as part of the larger GCC wide rail network &nbsp;</li>
	<li>Development of the Mubarak Al Kabeer port on Boubyan Island &nbsp;</li>
	<li>Privatization of selected public schools and universities &nbsp;</li>
	<li>Increase in private sector jobs for Kuwaiti nationals from 92,000 to 137,000 over the&nbsp;&nbsp; development period</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>King Abdullah Economic City (KAEC)</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.kaec.net/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="King Abdullah Economic City">KAEC</a>, one of the largest projects run by the private sector in the world, is an attempt to build an integrated city to benefit from investments and competition in the Saudi market. It provides investment opportunities in various sectors like logistics, retail, and manufacturing. Its strategic location on the Red Sea and the port&rsquo;s infrastructure would pave for significant business and investment opportunities.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>World Expo 2020</strong><br />
<a href="https://expo2020dubai.ae/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="World Expo 2020 - Dubai">World Expo 2020</a> in Dubai will be a six-month exhibition of trade, innovation and products from across the globe. It will boost tourism, trade and investments in the economy. The likely Government expenditure amounting to USD 7 to 8 bn on infrastructure will have a trickle-down effect on the other industries such as banking, real estate, hotel industry, aviation, etc. Such mega projects create employment opportunities in the economy.<br />
<br />
<strong>KEY QUESTION 3: What are the potentially emerging sectors at GCC regions?</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<em>Petrochemicals & Allied Industries</em><br />
GCC region provides a competitive edge to power-intensive sectors such as petrochemicals, metallurgy and fertilizers by offering cost advantage through its low-cost energy resources. The energy costs, natural gas prices and the average electricity cost in GCC are lower than the rest of the countries in the world. Once the oil prices rebound, vertical diversification can serve as a lucrative option by opening up doors for gas, own petrol stations abroad, petrochemicals, fertilizers, refineries, and other downstream and heavy industries. However, these are capital-intensive industries and will be profitable only when the oil prices shoot up and stabilize.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<em>Social Infrastructure</em><br />
Investment in education, building skill set for nationals to take up private sector jobs and R&D can expand the local pool of talent available for employment and can also create jobs through entrepreneurial ventures set up by nationals. Investment in these sectors will widen the scope of further investments in future. The private health sector has high potential, as there is a dearth of state doctors and staff. This led public hospitals in Abu Dhabi to enter into contract with international experts, to avail their services. The region is known for world&rsquo;s highest number of diabetic and obese patients. The private sector can jump in to provide better services to broader coverage.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<em>Retail & Tourism</em><br />
According to a Mamore report, Luxury Retail has an enormous potential for investments due to increasing brand awareness among the youth, deep-pocketed tourists and increasing income levels of the nationals. E-retail accounts only for a minimal share and the same is not likely to change soon due to the shopping related behavioral patterns and preferences of the GCC nationals.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Tourism has always been a flourishing sector across the GCC countries due to its strategic location between the west and the east. The Marmore Report on GCC Hospitality points out that the hosting of World Expo 2020 in Dubai and FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar, will lead to further growth in international travellers and thereby create opportunities in the hospitality sector.<br />
<br />
<em>Banking</em><br />
In the past, GCC states have been actively investing in other nations through acquisitions and Sovereign wealth funds. This broadens the scope of investment banking and consultancy in the GCC region. Financial Sector has been on a rise ever since the Gulf States realized the importance to diversify, and also due to the fiscal surplus of the Government and the high income of nationals. Even the insurance sector is likely to improve and experience a high growth as the income levels of citizens go up and many infrastructure related projects materialize.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>KEY QUESTION 4: What are the incentives to Invest in Gulf regions?</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
The Gulf countries have relaxed various regulations to welcome domestic and foreign players to investment in the private sector. There are free zones to offer tax benefits, easier foreign investment regulations to encourage foreign ownership and reduction in bureaucracy to reduce costs and delays. There are incentives to encourage entrepreneurship for the nationals.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Saudi Arabia introduced financing guarantee program for small businesses in 2006 worth USD 200mn, Qatar launched &lsquo;TechWadi&rsquo; in 2013, offering training and support to selective nationals for their entrepreneurial ventures, In Oman, 5% of the lending by the Banks for 2014 were to be channelized towards small and medium sized enterprises. Kuwait rolled out the National Fund for the Support and Development of SMEs to provide finances for small entrepreneurial ventures set up by nationals. Dubai SME programmes have offered support in areas of licensing, consultancy and facilitated start-up phase for about 13,500 local SMEs. A subsidy programme that reduces licensing and fees up to 90% for up to three years was also introduced. SME 100 is one of the Dubai SME programmes where SMEs are encouraged to apply for the rankings and the top 100 performers get recognized.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The inclusion of Qatar and the UAE in the MSCI&rsquo;s Emerging Market Index, the planned opening of Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s Tadawul Stock Exchange in 2015 and its signing MoUs with the Abu Dhabi Securities Market and Bahraini stock market could spread some positive sentiments to equity investors. The investment law in Qatar now welcomes full foreign ownership in IT, consultancy, sports, and culture, entertainment and distribution services.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Abu Dhabi&rsquo;s construction, manufacturing and finance sector are the most significant and attractive non-oil sectors for investors.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
There is great potential in Saudi Arabia in the generic pharmaceuticals, food processing and automotive subsectors. Export promotion entities such as Export Development Authority in Saudi Arabia and an Export Development Centre in Bahrain help companies to export their products. In Saudi Arabia, provision of credit facilities and insurance services also facilitate exports.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>KEY QUESTION 5: How is GCC investor-friendly?</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
GCC states have untapped potential for investors in various sectors. The region has an investor friendly taxation environment with low corporate tax rates. It has a well-developed infrastructure and mega development plans are set to materialize in the coming years. The increasing population and the increasing income levels of the nationals raise consumption and create new demand for various products and services.<br />

		<Title>[:en]Affordable housing in the GCC-Scale of the problem[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]Amongst a handful of regions with bright economic indicators, the GCC is projected to grow at 3.8% in 2016 according to the IMF.&nbsp; The region, which is highly reliant on oil and gas, is now hedging its bets by diversifying into non-hydrocarbon sectors. (Read: Marmore&rsquo;s report on <strong>&ldquo;</strong><strong>Affordable Housing</strong><strong>&rdquo;</strong>). Despite its richness, the issue of affordable housing is yet to be addressed thoroughly. What is the scale of this crisis?<br />
<br />
<strong>KEY QUESTION 1: Why is there a housing problem?</strong><br />
<br />
You may be surprised to know that only 48% of UAE&rsquo;s residents own their homes, and in Saudi Arabia this percentage is still lower at 35%. This is mainly due to the growing young population and increasing urbanization. The Economist states that GCC&rsquo;s population grew by more than 50% in the last decade, and is expected to reach 53 million in 2020.<br />
<br />
Population in the region as a whole grew by 75.1% from 29.4 million in 2000 to 51.5 million in 2014, and mainly comprises of young people, with more than 30% of the population aged between 15 and 29. The rising young population coupled with increasing GDP growth is the reason behind the rising demand for affordable housing, more prominent in low and middle-income groups in the region.<br />
<br />
<strong>Fig 1.3 Population growth of GCC countries (CAGR in % during 2008-2014)</strong><br />
<img alt="Population growth of GCC countries" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GCC-Affordable-fig1.jpg" /><br />
Source: IMF<br />
<br />
<strong>KEY QUESTION 2: What is the extent of the problem?</strong><br />
<br />
In Kuwait, the real estate growth is slow and the waiting list for housing units was over 109,122 in 2014.&nbsp; Housing demand is expected to grow at a CAGR of 2.7 per cent per annum from 2011 to 2022.<br />
In Oman, the waitlist for housing is 6,000, with the demand expected to grow at 3 per cent CAGR over 2011-2022. This expected growth is higher for Qatar at 4.3 per cent, and the country has the highest demand for affordable housing in the region. Private players focusing more on high-end constructions, rather than affordable housing, despite the huge influx of foreign construction workers for the FIFA world cup, is a primary reason for this spurt in demand.<br />
<br />
Housing is a costly affair in the region compared to other countries, such as Norway and the US. In Kuwait, for example, price of an average house is 30 times the average gross income of a person aged 25 to 39. &nbsp;This coupled with high youth unemployment rate of 29.8% in the MENA region is making affordable housing a distant dream.<br />
<br />
Limited credit facilities from banks and high mortgage rates are another issue. According to IMF, a 10 per cent increase in mortgage rates is associated with a 6 per cent increase in housing prices. In addition, GCC countries have stringent mortgage regulations, and this adds to the woes. The region&rsquo;s Sharia law prohibits banks to forcefully reclaim a person&rsquo;s house even in case of defaults. This discourages banks from giving mortgage loans to all citizens.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>KEY QUESTION 3: What are the steps that the government is taking?</strong><br />
<br />
Governments of the GCC countries are taking initiatives to solve this problem. Dubai, in a move to alleviate this issue, is planning to introduce compulsory quotas for affordable housing with regard to all new residential constructions. &nbsp;Bahrain has struck a USD 1 billion deal with the private property dealer Diyar, to build 3,100 social homes in the country. &nbsp;It has also started a Social housing Finance initiative for Bahraini citizens.<br />
<br />
Similarly, Saudi plans to construct 1 million housing units in addition to the existing ones, and Qatar increased the home loan ceiling to USD 330,000 for its nationals. In addition, GCC governments could focus on construction of residential towns, taking their cues from Singapore&rsquo;s &ldquo;vibrant towns&rdquo;.<br />
<br />
Kuwait in the recent five-year plan (2015-2020), has allocated more funds for the construction of an additional 45,000 housing units. Ministry of housing Affairs quoted that the housing problem will be completely resolved in the next 3-5 years. &nbsp;Similarly, Oman is investing USD 1.6 billion for housing projects. &nbsp;Qatar and Saudi too, have affordable housing development as one of their top priorities.<br />
<br />
<strong>KEY QUESTION 4: What are the steps that the government can take?</strong><br />
<br />
The GCC government can study and implement the Morocco government&rsquo;s public private partnership strategy to eliminate housing shortages. The Morocco Government in a quid pro quo deal has allocated 3,800 hectares of land to private developers. Another area of focus is the lack of credit and mortgage facility. GCC countries could initiate more Social housing finance schemes, along the lines of Bahraini government and focus on protecting the rights of lenders, in case the borrower defaults. This would incentivize banks to extend home loans to the needy.<br />
<br />
In addition to allocation of funds, GCC countries could focus on the management of projects. &nbsp;Proper framing of the eligibility criteria, so as to ensure that applications are made genuinely for housing and not for financial gains, is important. Standards of housing should be maintained, and the respective governments of the region could strike deals with private agencies for efficient maintenance of the public housing communities.&nbsp;[:]]]></Content>

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<strong>What is the structure of the telecom market in the GCC? How has it changed over the years?</strong><br />
The telecom market in the GCC has one of the highest penetration rates in the world with 170% mobile penetration and 77% internet penetration. The large number is attributable to ever rising population in the region and increasing number of expatriates. The number of subscribers grew from 87.97 million in June 2014 and is expected to reach 100 million by 2020. There are 235 companies that offer various telecom services mobile and fixed line telephony, fixed and mobile broadband, television services, mobile phone retail, modems, network equipment and other accessories and other telecom infrastructure equipment. Only 12 out of these 235 companies are listed, out of which 4 are fully government owned and the rest have different levels of government holding. Stakes of the government can be as high as 84% as in the case of STC.<br />
<br />
Until the early 2000&rsquo;s the GCC&rsquo;s telecom companies were a monopoly of the state. It is only after 2005 that liberalization started and telecom regulators started issuing licenses to foreign players to break the monopoly. Despite the efforts, so far, Vodafone is the only foreign player to have its own network infrastructure in the GCC market, with operations in Qatar (Virgin &amp; Lebara operate as MVNOs). The other countries do not have any foreign players. Table 1 shows the Mobile Virtual Network Operators and Mobile Operators in the GCC.<br />

<strong>What is the revenue structure of telecom companies? What are the steps they have taken to ensure revenue from voice calls is not impacted?</strong><br />
Telecom companies offer monthly fixed or flexible benefits plan to the consumers. A flexible benefit plan may or may not have fixed charges, but offer services like 2 GB data packs or 500 calls that the consumer can choose from.&nbsp; According to Markaz, an average consumer uses about 2GB of data, makes 200 phone calls and sends 100 SMS a month. As the usage increases, rates may change.<br />
<br />
ARPU which is the average combined revenue from data, voice and other services per user is a measure used to judge level of tariffs. If consumption among consumers is similar, a higher ARPU implies higher tariff.<br />
Telecom companies are very protective of the existing players and protecting their revenues from voice calls segment. For this purpose, UAE has banned VOIP services such as WhatsApp calling, Skype and Google Hangouts.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Why is there a general feeling that telecom rates in GCC are higher than in other regions?</strong><br />
According to Gulf Business, the tariffs for fixed-broadband in UAE and Saudi Arabia are believed to be the highest in the GCC. Kuwait has the highest tariffs when it comes to monthly consumption of telecom services.<br />
The following table compares the monthly tariffs of basic plans of countries in the GCC with other countries.<br />

<br />
Oman has the highest ARPU as compared to global peers, twice that of KSA, which by itself is higher than UK, USA and India. The mobile data segment tariffs are significantly higher. According to BQ magazine, charges for 1GB data starting from USD 6.34 in Saudi Arabia, USD 12.8 in Oman, USD 17.1 in Qatar and USD 27 in the UAE. 1 GB data in India costs USD 4. There is complete monopoly of operators in certain regions due to lack of infrastructure and telecom operators are able to impose high charges in these regions.&nbsp; For example, Du and Etisalat in UAE are both offering overpriced services, as well as have in the past, hiked tariffs and plans without the consumer&rsquo;s knowledge. Etisalat had to form a team to look into the issue after the Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRA) issued warnings to the companies on receiving multiple consumer complaints. Etisalat refunded excess money charged.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Why are telecom companies unwilling to reduce tariffs in the region?</strong><br />
Telecom companies in the GCC are in the diversification phase. Etisalat and STC are aggressively acquiring companies and partnerships with local information and communication companies within and outside their countries. Oredoo has operations in 15 countries through subsidiaries. Such diversification leads to increase in fixed costs which include spectrum, licenses and laying down required infrastructure which are recurring in nature. Thus, they have to stick to a high tariff to maintain high revenues and a healthy margin.<br />
<br />
Secondly, Mobile Virtual Network Operators affect pricing of telecom companies. MVNO can offer voice, internet and broadband services, uses its own billing system, sales support representatives and customer support systems. MVNOs are cheap substitutes for conventional telecom operators as they use price as their Unique Selling Propositions (USPs) to attract customers. Saudi Arabia is the only GCC country to have 2 MVNOs, viz Virgin Mobile which uses STC&rsquo;s infrastructure and Lebara which uses Mobily&rsquo;s network. UAE, Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar do not have MVNOs, which is why tariffs are very high in these countries.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Why is it important to reduce tariffs? What steps are being taken by GCC countries to break the monopoly?</strong><br />
Higher tariffs prevent digital inclusion of poorer sections of the society. The GCC has a large number of expatriates who draw very low salaries. They cannot afford high rates. Despite various e-governance initiatives and services by various countries, their effectiveness is mitigated thanks to high charges. Communication expenses form a major chunk of all businesses, thus making it more important to reduce tariffs to make businesses more competitive.<br />
<br />
The telecom sector in Saudi Arabia is much more liberalized compared to other GCC nations. They have 5 operators and 2 MVNOs, but still have fewer players compared to developed countries. In the UAE, TRA allowed network sharing for voice and internet services in 2015, enabling consumers to choose operators in all areas. The TRA is planning to include infrastructure sharing for television services which is likely to break the regional monopoly of operators.&nbsp;<br />

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<strong>KEY QUESTION 1: What are Basel III norms and why are they important for application in Islamic Banking? </strong><br />
<br />
The Basel III norms were introduced after the 2008 crisis to make the banking system more robust. Under the norms, banks shall hold 6% of Tier-I capital and 2% of Tier II capital. Tier I capital includes 4.5% of common equity and 1.5% of additional Tier-I capital which includes preferred stock and hybrid securities.<br />
<br />
Basel III norms are mandatory for all banks, including Islamic banks. This ensures that banks are well equipped to withstand financial shocks and maintain higher levels of liquidity to be prepared for uncertainties in the financial markets.<br />
<br />
Islamic banks generally have low-profitability assets like cash and central bank deposits, and less of High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA), which has a major impact on liquidity. The Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB) has proposed a few guidelines to help financial institutions improve liquidity coverage ratio and improve HQLA.<br />
<br />
<strong>KEY QUESTION 2: What are the capital requirements applicable to Islamic Banking and sukuks? </strong><br />
<br />
The IFSB that sets standards and principles for Financial Institutions offering Islamic Financial Services has proposed an additional 2.5% of capital conservation for Islamic banks as a buffer, in addition to the specified minimum capital of 6% under Tier-I and 2% under Tier-2 (totaling 8%). This is because products used by Islamic banks have high risk underlying physical assets such as real estate. The norms also state that banks should have a counter cyclical buffer of up to 2.5% of capital in case of excessive credit growth.<br />
<br />
Islamic banks can have sukuks with a portion of additional Tier-I and Tier-II capital based on their assets. Sukuk is Arabic for financial certificates, but colloquially refers to the Islamic equivalent of bonds that are structured to comply with Sharia laws.<br />
<br />
In this definition, Tier-I capital includes perpetual Sukuk or Musharaka, which is a joint enterprise or partnership structure based on profit sharing instead of interest-bearing loans. Mudaraba and Wakala have a maturity period of 5 years and can be classified under Tier-II capital. Mudaraba is a partnership where capital in cash or assets but the fund provider party provides no debt and the other party, also called the mudarib, provides labor. In a Wakala, depositors place funds with the bank to invest in suitable Shariah projects and the bank acts as agent to invest these funds into various assets.<br />
<br />

<br />
Source: Nomura Institute of Capital market research<br />
<br />
<strong>KEY QUESTION 3: Why is it important to distinguish between conventional banks and Islamic banks for implementing Basel III norms?</strong><br />
<br />
The reason why these rules were put in place is that Islamic banks differ from conventional banks in terms of operations and risk profile. The same set of regulations of Basel III norms is currently applicable to both and this does not recognize the differences between the two types of banks. Two problems occur due to the differences.<br />
First, the main source of funds for Islamic banking is from Profit Sharing Investment Accounts (PSIA). The capital adequacy ratios applied by Basel III norms do not consider the fact that a major portion of the risk is borne by the investors and not by banks.<br />
<br />
Second, Islamic banks are prohibited from getting interest payments under Sharia Laws, which renders high level of liquidity risk on the assets as compared to conventional banks. Thus, the financial tools that involve interest under Basel III have limited applicability to Islamic banking.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The &ldquo;Basel III-compliant sukuk&rdquo; was created to fulfill revised capital standards. The first Basel III-compliant sukuk was introduced by Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank (ADIB) in the UAE in November 2012, with a value of USD 1 billion. This was compliant with Basel III Additional Tier I capital (AT-1) requirements. The response by investors was overwhelming with the issue oversubscribed by 30 times. This success encouraged other banks across UAE, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia to issue sukuk instruments to improve AT-1 or Tier-2 capital. According to Rasameel Sukuk Report, July 2014, Ten Basel III compliant sukuks were issued until June 2014 with a value of close to USD 5 billion.<br />
<br />
<strong>KEY QUESTION 4: What is the market structure of sukuks?</strong><br />
The largest market share of sukuks is held by Saudi Arabia, totaling 48% followed by UAE with 41% and Malaysian Islamic banks with 11% outstanding as of May 2014 (Figure 2). Malaysia has the largest market share in terms of outstanding sukuk volume, according to the Islamic Finance Information Service. However, Malaysian banks don&rsquo;t really need to issue Basel III compliant sukuks. This is because, they have an advantage of being capitalized to the extent of sustaining a 300% increase in non-performing loans without Tier-I capital falling to below 7%.<br />

<br />
NBAD in the UAE managed the USD 1 billion perpetual sukuk issuance for Dubai Islamic Bank in January 2015, which was the first public regulatory Basel III compliant capital issuance. Qatar Islamic bank also suggested a plan to raise Basel III compliant Tier-1 capital worth QAR 2 billion to fuel construction of facilities for 2022 Football World Cup.<br />
<br />
Out of the entire issue of Basel III compliant sukuks, 41% of volume raised supports Basel III AT1 capital and 59% volume raised supports Tier 2 requirements.<br />
<br />
<strong>KEY QUESTION 5: What are the opportunities in the horizon for the sukuk market?</strong><br />
<br />
Several. Companies with high quality credit can utilize sukuks, which are issued at favorable terms by Islamic banks. Banks are likely to purchase sukuks issued by government entities as these would improve the quality of the bank&rsquo;s capital being low risk bonds. Being a part of the definition of IFSB guidelines, sukuks are expected to increase credit quality of liquid assets. The UAE&rsquo;s central bank has made provisions to accept sukuks as collateral for banks from April 2015, a move which other regulators are expected to follow suit. It is likely that issuers may start listing their instruments on the stock exchange.<br />
<br />
Thus, Islamic banks are likely to be encouraged to issue more Basel III compliant sukuks in the near future with the strengthening of capital requirements and liquidity needs under Basel III norms and IFSB regulations.<br />
&nbsp;[:ar]<strong>KEY QUESTION 1: What are Basel III norms and why are they important for application in Islamic Banking? </strong><br />
<br />
The Basel III norms were introduced after the 2008 crisis to make the banking system more robust. Under the norms, banks shall hold 6% of Tier-I capital and 2% of Tier II capital. Tier I capital includes 4.5% of common equity and 1.5% of additional Tier-I capital which includes preferred stock and hybrid securities.<br />
<br />
Basel III norms are mandatory for all banks, including Islamic banks. This ensures that banks are well equipped to withstand financial shocks and maintain higher levels of liquidity to be prepared for uncertainties in the financial markets.<br />
<br />
Islamic banks generally have low-profitability assets like cash and central bank deposits, and less of High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA), which has a major impact on liquidity. The Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB) has proposed a few guidelines to help financial institutions improve liquidity coverage ratio and improve HQLA.<br />
<br />
<strong>KEY QUESTION 2: What are the capital requirements applicable to Islamic Banking and sukuks? </strong><br />
<br />
The IFSB that sets standards and principles for Financial Institutions offering Islamic Financial Services has proposed an additional 2.5% of capital conservation for Islamic banks as a buffer, in addition to the specified minimum capital of 6% under Tier-I and 2% under Tier-2 (totaling 8%). This is because products used by Islamic banks have high risk underlying physical assets such as real estate. The norms also state that banks should have a counter cyclical buffer of up to 2.5% of capital in case of excessive credit growth.<br />
<br />
Islamic banks can have sukuks with a portion of additional Tier-I and Tier-II capital based on their assets. Sukuk is Arabic for financial certificates, but colloquially refers to the Islamic equivalent of bonds that are structured to comply with Sharia laws.<br />
<br />
In this definition, Tier-I capital includes perpetual Sukuk or Musharaka, which is a joint enterprise or partnership structure based on profit sharing instead of interest-bearing loans. Mudaraba and Wakala have a maturity period of 5 years and can be classified under Tier-II capital. Mudaraba is a partnership where capital in cash or assets but the fund provider party provides no debt and the other party, also called the mudarib, provides labor. In a Wakala, depositors place funds with the bank to invest in suitable Shariah projects and the bank acts as agent to invest these funds into various assets.<br />

<br />
<strong>KEY QUESTION 3: Why is it important to distinguish between conventional banks and Islamic banks for implementing Basel III norms?</strong><br />
<br />
The reason why these rules were put in place is that Islamic banks differ from conventional banks in terms of operations and risk profile. The same set of regulations of Basel III norms is currently applicable to both and this does not recognize the differences between the two types of banks. Two problems occur due to the differences.<br />
First, the main source of funds for Islamic banking is from Profit Sharing Investment Accounts (PSIA). The capital adequacy ratios applied by Basel III norms do not consider the fact that a major portion of the risk is borne by the investors and not by banks.<br />
<br />
Second, Islamic banks are prohibited from getting interest payments under Sharia Laws, which renders high level of liquidity risk on the assets as compared to conventional banks. Thus, the financial tools that involve interest under Basel III have limited applicability to Islamic banking.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The &ldquo;Basel III-compliant sukuk&rdquo; was created to fulfill revised capital standards. The first Basel III-compliant sukuk was introduced by Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank (ADIB) in the UAE in November 2012, with a value of USD 1 billion. This was compliant with Basel III Additional Tier I capital (AT-1) requirements. The response by investors was overwhelming with the issue oversubscribed by 30 times. This success encouraged other banks across UAE, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia to issue sukuk instruments to improve AT-1 or Tier-2 capital. According to Rasameel Sukuk Report, July 2014, Ten Basel III compliant sukuks were issued until June 2014 with a value of close to USD 5 billion.<br />
<br />
<strong>KEY QUESTION 4: What is the market structure of sukuks?</strong><br />
The largest market share of sukuks is held by Saudi Arabia, totaling 48% followed by UAE with 41% and Malaysian Islamic banks with 11% outstanding as of May 2014 (Figure 2). Malaysia has the largest market share in terms of outstanding sukuk volume, according to the Islamic Finance Information Service. However, Malaysian banks don&rsquo;t really need to issue Basel III compliant sukuks. This is because, they have an advantage of being capitalized to the extent of sustaining a 300% increase in non-performing loans without Tier-I capital falling to below 7%.<br />
<br />

		<Title>[:en]Japanese Interest in Islamic Banking: Key Questions[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]Islamic banking derives its basis from the principles laid down in Sharia and unlike conventional finance prohibits payment of and charging of interest. It has caught the attention of the global financial services and banking industry. The growth in Sharia-compliant products and services has happened over the years as financial institutions took their time to understand the principles, and design products and services that comply with those principles. Modern banks started offering sharia-compliant products around mid-1970s. Japan, once an economic powerhouse, has now shown interest in Islamic Banking.<br />

<br />

<br />
<strong>Question 2: Why is Japan getting into Islamic Banking?</strong><br />
<br />
The Japanese domestic banking industry witnessed year-on-year loan growth of 2.5% in Feb 2015, while Asian economies such as Malaysia and Indonesia, which embraced Islamic banking, posted better growth. Indonesian Islamic banks grew at 8.3% in 2014, which in itself is a modest figure as compared to 25.2% posted in 2013, according to Reuters.&nbsp; The total assets of Sharia-compliant products and services globally are around USD 2trillion. Malaysia&rsquo;s central bank reports that 80% of its assets were entrusted to Islamic banks and Islamic segments of conventional banks together. Other Islamic products like Sukuk bonds (15%), Islamic Investment Funds (4%), and takaful, the Islamic version of insurance (1%) covered the balance 20% in 2012. Global Sukuk issuance is expected to exceed USD 64billion in 2013 to reach around USD 70billion in 2014. The growth would be mainly driven by increased issuance from governments. The Bloomberg-Malaysia Sukuk Ex-MYR Index gained 3.4 percent in 2014 to a record 116.52 points, after rising 0.8 percent in 2013.<br />
<br />
The rising global demand for Islamic products coupled with slow domestic growth has led to the Japanese government embracing Islamic banking, and making necessary amendments to ease the banking and financial procedures pertinent to the Islamic banking. According to EY, Islamic banking assets grew globally at an annual rate of 17.6% between 2009 and 2013, and are expected to grow at 19.7% a year until 2018.<br />
<br />
The Japanese want to create a favorable environment to enable the influx of Islamic capital. The Japanese financial institutions are primarily looking for international market to sell different debt instruments that are Sharia compliant. Currently this is being done through foreign subsidiaries of Japan-based companies. Companies like Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (BTMU) and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp in Japan are doing it through their subsidiaries. But since April 2014, the Japanese supervisory body has allowed banks to engage in Islamic finance at their overseas branches. This takes us to the question of how to induce the inflow of capital through Islamic products. Has there been any such initiation in the past?<br />
<br />
Japan has had an initial encounter with Islamic finance in 2005 when its financial institutions helped their counterparts in the UAE and Malaysia to attract investments from Islamic investors. Thus, Japan has already entered the international sukuk market, which is expected to grow to USD 900billion by 2017, according to Ernst &amp; Young. This was followed by issuing of sukuks by companies, such as Nomura Investment Company and Toyota Motor Corp. in 2010 and 2012, respectively. In 2014, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (Malaysia) Bhd Berhad (BMTU Malaysia), have issued the world&rsquo;s first Sukuk denominated in Yen (Emas Sukuk).<br />

<br />
<strong>Question 3: How has Japan facilitated IB?</strong><br />
Japan has brought a slew of changes in its financial and capital market through amendment of the Financial Instrument and Exchange Law in 2007, and the Banking and Insurance Business Law in 2008. It made amendments to the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Banking Act/Insurance Business Act in yet another important reform influenced by Islamic finance. Japan also brought out tax reforms for promoting foreign investments from Islamic capital hubs, by amending the Asset Securitization Act in 2011, which identifies ijarah sukuk as a special bond type, which had instantly visible benefits. Earlier, profits earned through sukuks were subjected to 15% withholding tax, while it was 0% for conventional bonds. However, all these Islamic transactions are subjected to following conditions:<br />
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>Transaction has to be equivalent to &lsquo;Money-Lending&rsquo;,</li>
	<li>Transactions have to be approved by a board consisting of experts with professional knowledge of the religious domain</li>
	<li>Receipt of interest is strictly prohibited</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;<br />
There are a few Islamic banks already in Japan - PT. Bank Negara Indonesia (Tokyo), Boubyan Bank, Meezan Bank, Bank Indonesia Tokyo, Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JABIC) and Qatar Islamic bank. These present an opportunity for Japanese financial and banking industry to fasten the process of learning and gaining expertise in this fast moving business. But, are these reforms and changes sufficient to take its Islamic banking industry to a strong position on the global map?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Question 4: What are the principal challenges in Japan</strong><br />
There are four challenges. We look at each in turn.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
	<li><u>Absence of strict international standardization for Islamic financial transactions</u> &ndash; There has been instances, where compliance to the Sharia was an issue among the scholars from Islamic countries. In one case, Sukuks proposed by Goldman&rsquo;s Sachs did not comply with&nbsp;<em>sharia</em>. In another case, an Islamic credit card based on a transaction known as baya al- inah (<em>Bai&#39; al &#39;inah, is a sale and buy-back agreement</em>), approved by Malaysian scholars, was rejected by Arab scholars as being too close to interest-based lending.</li>
	<li><u>Lack of expertise and in-depth industry knowledge</u> &ndash; There is no dearth of quantity of information available in Japan, but quality is an issue. In the early days, a lot of information was misconstrued by the Japanese scholars. Hence, order to avoid such pitfalls in the future, banking and financial industry of Japan needs to gain expertise and in-depth industry knowledge about Islamic banking.</li>
	<li><u>Lack of networking</u> &ndash; Although there are well known professional bankers in Japan who have in-depth knowledge of Islamic banking, these scholars are not much exposed to actual Islamic transactions. This results in lower networking with bankers in other parts of the world.</li>
	<li><u>Increasing competition among peers at global level</u> &ndash; In the wake of growing competition among banking industries in different countries, Japan needs to augment the products and services that are being offered.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Question 5: What does the future hold?</strong><br />
Despite all the challenges Islamic banking is an excellent opportunity for Japan to diversify its banking industry. The big corporations of Japan, which are active in the Middle East and South East Asia, particularly in sectors such as infrastructure, transportation and consumer goods, will see huge benefits by venturing head-on into the Islamic finance. Japan needs to gain experience at a fast pace, and then leverage that knowledge, to get due recognition in the world of Islamic Finance.<br />

		<Title><![CDATA[[:en]The rise & rise of GCC Airlines[:]]]></Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]Here are FOUR questions that you would like to ask about the GCC airline industry.&nbsp; We provide the answers.<br />
<br />
#<strong>1. How well in recent years has the aviation sector in GCC region grown?</strong><br />
There is only one word for it, &ldquo;tremendously.&rdquo;&nbsp; The two figures below tell you the story of growth; the first is country specific and the second is aircraft specific.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Figure 1- Passengers carried by registered air carriers in the UAE and Qatar</strong><br />
<img alt="fig-1.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-rise-and-rise-of-GCC-Airlines-fig1.jpg" style="width: 533px; height: 194px;" title="fig-1.jpg" /><br />
Source &ndash; World Bank<br />
<br />
<strong>Figure 2 - Passengers carried by Emirates (in Millions)</strong><br />
<br />
<img alt="fig-2.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-rise-and-rise-of-GCC-Airlines-fig2.jpg" style="width: 533px; height: 194px;" title="fig-2.jpg" />
<ul>
	<li>The passengers carried by Emirates grew at a CAGR of 12.33% from 2011 to 2014.</li>
	<li>The comparable growth rate for Qatar Airways was 14 percent.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<br />
There are broadly three reasons for this growth. The first is the GCC&rsquo;s geographical advantage.&nbsp; It lies at the crossroad, between the West and the East making it easier for short hauls to fly. Little wonder, it has now become a global transportation hub.&nbsp; Two other drivers are the growth in tourism in the region, which has led to a higher demand from leisure travelers, and the exploding expatriate population.<br />
<br />
<strong>#2. How did it all begin and how have the GCC Airlines fared?</strong><br />
Thirty years ago, in 1985, the Dubai government provided USD 10million as seed capital to Emirates to start a local airline.&nbsp; It began with two new aircrafts, and one leased from Pakistan Airline. Emirates&rsquo; first route was from Dubai to Karachi. Soon, the world realized Dubai&rsquo;s potential as a commercial hub, given its geographical advantage. Emirates capitalized on the opportunities by continually expanding as also by adding destinations in quick succession.<br />
<br />
In 2010, Emirates ordered for 32 superjumbos with Airbus. With such expansion, the airline required more space at Dubai Airport. The massive Terminal 3, in Dubai International Airport, was built especially for Emirates Airline.&nbsp; Emirates carried about 45million passengers in 2014, which is close to 65% of the UAE&rsquo;s total passenger traffic. Emirates has remained profitable every year for the last 25 years, unlike many of its regional peers. It is now the world&rsquo;s largest airline in terms of international passenger traffic and is targeting 70million passengers annually by 2020.<br />

Today, Qatar Airways, Emirates, and Etihad Airways are in the international market and are among the top airlines, giving a significant competition to big foreign players. Qatar Airways was ranked second on the list of &lsquo;&rsquo;The World&#39;s Top 100 Airlines in 2014&rdquo; while Emirates stood fourth.&nbsp; Slowly, but surely, there is a preferential shift to the GCC region-based airlines, due to their competitive prices and high-quality services.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>#3. What&rsquo;s the open-skies agreement? What are the benefits and complaints?</strong><br />
The open-skies agreement majorly entails the following:
<ul>
	<li>Permit to unrestricted takeoffs and landings in partner countries</li>
	<li>Follow specified level of safety standards &nbsp;</li>
	<li>Ease the regulatory process of both passengers and cargo &nbsp;</li>
	<li>Allowing for airline investment &nbsp;</li>
	<li>Authorize airline Joint Ventures, and cooperative marketing</li>
</ul>
<br />
Benefit wise, the consumers of both the countries stand to gain with such an agreement as it could drive down the prices, and allow more accessibility to the partner country. The US made the open-skies agreement with the GCC countries in 2001-2002.<br />
<br />
However there are some complaints and these are from the US partners. The complaint is that the Gulf carriers have a skewed advantage as they receive massive government subsidies enabling them to sell tickets at a lower price, with the sole intention of gaining more market share. The second complaint is the imbalance in the mutual benefits from the agreement. The American airlines feel that GCC carriers&rsquo; full access to the vast US market is much more lucrative than American carriers; full access to the GCC region.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>#4. What&rsquo;s this fuss over subsidy and how far is the complaint true?</strong><br />
The US and European players claim that the Gulf governments, given their deep pockets, have been subsidizing the Airlines, giving them an unfair advantage. In 2015, three of the four largest US airlines &ndash; American, Delta and United Airways jointly submitted a 55-page dossier to the US Government that is said to prove their allegations. The details disclosed state that in the last decade, three GCC region&rsquo;s carriers &ndash; Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways have received subsidies to the tune of USD 42billion. The purpose of the dossier is to urge US lawmakers to reconsider their open-skies treaty with UAE and Qatar.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The proof apparently shows that Etihad has received an alleged USD 17billion of subsidy since 2004, which includes USD 4.6billion in interest-free government loans and government capital injections amounting to USD 6.3billion. Also, Etihad supposedly classified its interest free loan as equity, as it didn&rsquo;t have any obligation to repay it for the foreseeable future. Similarly, Qatar Airways has allegedly received USD 16 billion in subsidies in the last decade. &nbsp;Like&nbsp;Etihad Airways, Qatar Airway is alleged to have converted these loans to equity in 2009 because repayment was never planned. Emirates has allegedly received subsidies worth USD 5 billion since 2004. The subsidies have been in the form of discounted airport charges, de-unionized labor and tax exemptions from the government.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
GCC carriers are refuting the allegations. Emirates has stated that it only ever received USD 10million as a seed capital and USD 88 million worth of infrastructure investment by its government. It says that it has in turn paid a dividend of USD 2.3billion till date to its shareholders. The claims made by the US airline consortium haven&rsquo;t been verified as yet, and all the Gulf carriers seem ready to issue a comprehensive rebuttal of them.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
It remains to be seen what the outcome of these allegations would be.<br />

		<Title>[:en]KSA Obesity: Key Questions[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]There has been a welcome surge in the economic prosperity of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). With prosperity, socio-cultural and lifestyle changes have emerged. This is like a curator&rsquo;s egg, good in parts. The disturbing part is the increased incidence of a dangerous medical condition, namely obesity. Once considered a Western phenomenon, it is now very much an Arabic problem: it hurts people medically, and the kingdom financially.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&ldquo;Obesity&rdquo; and &ldquo;Diabetes&rdquo; are close cousins.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Type-2 diabetes, a fall out of obesity, is increasing rapidly, including among ki<font size="1"><span style="line-height: 14.4444446563721px;">ds</span></font>. Obesity leads to other health complications, like hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that globally overweight and obesity are the causes for 44% of diabetes, 23% of heart diseases and 7-14% of certain types of cancer. Worse still, there are societal impacts like low-productivity and reduced confidence levels of the affected group. Psychologically, the obese are more prone to depression and low self-esteem.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<strong>Why Obesity?</strong><br />
To assess the causes of obesity, various studies have been conducted in the Kingdom. A study by the King Abdulaziz Medical City revealed that among&nbsp;school children there is a high correlation between watching TV and obesity. A study conducted on college students indicated that unhealthy eating habits like fried food consumption and frequent snacking are the causes for obesity. Other risk factors include physical inactivity. According to the CIA world fact book close to 35% of Saudi population suffer from obesity and ranks 19th globally. A report published by Marmore Research on KSA Healthcare states that obesity has been a phenomenon that has increased rapidly over the past decade; reasons for the increase include sedentary lifestyle, aversion to physically demanding work, consumption of foods that have very high calorific value, wide prevalence of western quick service restaurants and the local sociocultural setup that promotes unhealthy eating habits.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In short, being a couch potato watching the idiot box adinfinitum, consuming junk food and leading a sedentary life are the principal causes for obesity and diabetes.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>How does it affect children?</strong><br />
The alarming incidence of obesity among kids is a major concern.&nbsp; The obesity rate for school-going children is 9.3% and for pre-school children is 6%. Actually, pre-teens are going through bariatric surgeries, which is a tad sad, as internationally the minimum age for such surgeries is 14. Though this surgery results in immediate reduction in weight, it is not sustainable in the long run, if the patient doesn&rsquo;t maintain a healthy lifestyle.&nbsp; Medicine can work only up to a point.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Adult women population is another high-risk group, thanks to socio-cultural norms. Amongst unemployed women, low activity and high fatty consumption are the causes. Worse still, they do not involve themselves in physical activities<font size="1"><span style="line-height: 14.4444446563721px;">.</span></font>&nbsp;Adult males are no better given their propensity to consume of salt-laden foods and lack of exercise.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>What is the action plan?</strong><br />
The cost of health care is huge on the country as the government foots the bill of these bariatric surgeries for adults.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
A number of research centers like ORC (Obesity Research Centre); some&nbsp;Institutes like the Saudi Bio-bank; and a slew of health care centers such as tertiary care centers and diagnostic centers have been set up.&nbsp; Mark it prevention is the key as only limited measures like surgeries are available at a later stage. Remember, when the BMI exceeds certain levels, there are immediate health risks that can&rsquo;t be solved merely with exercise and controlled food intake.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Health education and health promotion programs through workshops, seminars and mass media can help generate awareness. Educational materials targeted at schools and colleges will help in prevention at an early age. Measures like allowing girls in the schools to participate in sports are being considered.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Healthy eating habits including importance of nutrition and balanced diet should be highlighted. Behavioral changes like reducing the time for sedentary activities such as watching TV, playing meaningless video games and increasing the motivation for physical exercise need to be undertaken.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In sum: while the government is working on spreading awareness among the public, only when individuals adopt a healthy lifestyle, will it help in reducing the number of cases of obesity.<br />

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<strong><u>GCC: Print media still running strong…</u></strong>
The whiff of the early morning coffee has always romanced the fresh crispy fragrance of the newspaper. The winds of change are perhaps beginning to blow.

The surprising fact is that while the preference and demand for print media has steadily been declining over the years in America and Europe, it has been on the rise in the GCC. According to a Marmore report on <a title="GCC Media Research Report" href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/gcc-media/">GCC Media</a>, the circulation of newspaper in the Middle East grew at a CAGR of 3.5 per cent (2007-11)<span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="line-height: 14.4444446563721px;">.</span></span>

The reason for bucking the trend is simple. Print media has been hugely trusted because every bit of information and new that goes into it is edited and tested for authenticity. This is not the case with social media like Facebook and Twitter, where anyone can post anything they want. It therefore comes as no surprise that a survey by Ketchum Global Research and Analytics has indicated that 48% of Middle East respondents give a thumbs up to the print media!

<strong>Why digital media?</strong>
Lately, however, digital media has begun eating into the share of print media. The main reason for the increasing preference in digital media is instant news, ease of availability, customization, search options and the ability to retrieve archives instantly. Instant updates of news feeds, downloadable e-magazines and social media apps are already a rage among the younger generation.

There is a huge potential for growth of digital media, but there are hurdles.

The first hurdle is the low penetration of Arabic content on the Internet. That is where bulk of the action is likely to lie. Revenue is important. Subscriptions alone do not sustain printing houses. Advertisements are the key. Ads constitute close to 75% of revenue of print media. But it is only a matter of time until content providers tap the virtual space to publish ads and take advantage of high-speed videos and pictures and full screen images to increase their ad revenues. A shift of revenues from subscriptions to online ads is vital in the growth of digital media.

A second hurdle is that high-speed connectivity is fragmented in the GCC. There is a huge disparity in the connection speed within the GCC countries. Speed ranges from 9.8kb/s in Kuwait to 81.1kb/s in Saudi Arabia. To increase reach and speed, GCC countries have spent huge sums on ICT infrastructure development.  This has propelled growth. Penetration has gone up by 15.3% CAGR  (2008-2012). The number of users per 100 people has risen from 57 in 2010 to 78 in 2013.  By the way, Bahrain, Oman, Lebanon and UAE are the most dynamic countries in the IDI (ICT Development Index) 2012. It is forecasted that ICT spending in the GCC will reach USD 244 Billion over the period 2012-15.

Another option, a boon to smartphone users, are 3G and 4G connection with high-speed connectivity and seamless reach. 4G networks are 3 to 6 times faster than 3G. A high mobile penetration in the GCC at 152% is the perfect setting to push 3G and 4G mobile broadband services into the market. Mobile internet traffic is increasing rapidly. The region’s mobile internet access to total internet traffic is expected to grow from 8% in 2012 to 27% in 2017, while consumer traffic through mobile devices is expected to grow from 10%
<div>
<div id="ftn1">in 2012 to 31% in 2017.  Kuwait’s mobile broadband segment grew rapidly with 15.9% LTE penetration at the end of 3Q 2013.

In recent developments, Qatar received its 4G network in Feb 2014 from Ooredoo, which was free of cost to its customers. You-too is a US based software company, which plans to introduce social TV in MENA region, with its first base in Dubai. Social TV is a concept in which users can use pictures, video, voting and social media in real time to interact with TV programming through Mobile devices in HD quality and real time. They can also record videos on their phones and broadcast it on TV within seconds. The videos can be sent to the producers or uploaded on the host website to be broadcasted real time. Imagine, if people can see what is happening through someone else’s eyes, it means that the news has now become trusted, and it will automatically reduce demand for print media for trusted news.

However, such a major shift will take time. As the younger generation takes over in the next few years and technology moves to 3G and 4G mobile internet connections, only then will preference shift to digital media. Until then, the print media is bound to rule.

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]Did you know that GCC citizens prefer to send their children to public schools? A good reason for that is the low cost of education in these schools.&nbsp; But times are changing.&nbsp; With the winds of globalization now blowing, parents in the GCC are slowly but surely beginning to vote for private schools.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Private schools provide the environment for kids to develop employable skills. Most of these schools offer an international curriculum that is well accepted in top universities like Cambridge and Harvard.&nbsp; To add, they also have great infrastructure, high safety standards, well-qualified teachers and a platter of languages and activities for students. These schools mold a child better.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
On the flip side is the issue of affordability. While some schools offer quality education at a low cost, many schools, particularly the American and European (UK) ones, charge up to thrice the amount charged by Asian or Arabic schools. This means that not everyone can have the opportunity to study in these schools.<br />
<br />
<strong>Levels of education </strong><br />
The levels of education are divided into three: pre-primary for young children, primary and secondary which is class 1 to class 12 and tertiary which includes graduation and post-graduation.&nbsp; The fee structure varies between each level and is different for different types of schools.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The GCC has four types of schoolsi.e, Arabic, Bilingual, American and Asian. By large, Indian schools in the UAE have the highest enrolment given the large number of expatriate population. In contrast, in Oman and Saudi Arabia, public schools are preferred.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The following table indicates the annual fee structure by education level.<br />

According to a report on GCC Education by Kuwait Financial Centre &ldquo;Markaz&rdquo;, Asian and Arabic schools are the cheapest, while Bilingual schools charge about 1.5 times the fees of these schools. Western schools are the most expensive, with pre-primary schools charging USD 4,590 per annum while higher secondary schools cost a bomb at an average of USD 10,404 annually.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If we split it country-wise, Private schools in the UAE are most expensive, with fees ranging from an average of USD 6,000 for Indian schools to USD 13,797 for British schools. Indian school fees are cheapest averaging USD 2,343 per annum, averaging between USD 709 in Saudi Arabia to USD 6,001 in UAE. International curriculum costs the highest at an average of USD 11,166 per annum. Bahrain has only two American schools and they charge a whopping USD 16,761 on an average, while the same costs USD 8,752 in Qatar. UK curriculum schools are cheaper in Bahrain with an average fee of USD 3,744 compared to USD 13,416 in Oman. (See table below)<br />

Unfortunately, such high fees are not welcomed by expatriates, most of whom spend about 30% of their income on their children&rsquo;s education (Source: WhichSchoolAdvisor.com.) The situation is sometimes so bad that they are forced to take education loans. This is particularly true in the UAE, where soaring rents, high cost of living, hikes in school fees and close to stagnant income adds extra burden on their already heavy household budgets. The high fees impact the perceived value of education and studying in lower quality schools would mean that students will be in a less attractive position to garner better management positions after completing education.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Private schools present a different picture. They believe fee hikes are crucial to improve investment.&nbsp; High quality teachers demand high salaries and generally amount to about 60% of total expenses of schools. Many owners of schools have given personal guarantees to banks. Restriction on fees will mean that additional funds will not be available to improve school infrastructure.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
On the other hand, the governments are in a way right in restricting fee hikes so that high quality education can be affordable to everyone. Fee hikes by private schools have recently been stayed in Dubai for the benefit of the students and parents.<br />

What ultimately matters is the quality of students churned out of schools and whether they are able to get admitted to good universities and graduate as good quality young professionals, fit to work in the global environment. This is why more people are beginning to prefer private schools to public school education. According to Booz and Co., the number of schools is expected to double from 2 million in 2014 to 4 million by 2020.

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<span style="color: #000000;">The aviation industry in UAE contributes roughly 12% to the country’s economy, reflecting the country’s huge investment in airports and airlines. The aviation industry is a USD 39.4 billion (Dh 145 billion) industry, contributing 28% to Dubai’s GDP. The industry provides 250,000 jobs in Dubai and supports 14% of the workforce in UAE. International Air Transport Association (IATA) has predicted that the UAE will be the second fastest growth market for international passenger traffic from 2009 to 2014, second only to China. The UAE aviation is poised to grow dramatically in the coming years with major expansions started and is expected to play a key role in diversifying the economy of the country.</span>

The five major airlines in the UAE aviation market are Emirates Airlines (Dubai), Etihad Airways (Abu Dhabi), Air Arabia (Sharjah), Fly Dubai (Dubai) and RAK Airways (Ras Al Khaimah). The passenger traffic at Dubai International has grown at a CAGR of 13.75% from 15.9 million passengers in 2002 to 57.7 million passengers in 2012, making it the fourth largest airport in the world in terms of international traffic. By 2021, the passenger traffic in Dubai International Airport is expected to reach 100 million.

South Asia has been a huge market for UAE airlines considering the country’s favorable geographical position. UAE acts as the connecting point for the west and the east, connecting the Asian countries to Europe and Africa. It is able to connect two thirds of the world population within 8 hours of flying time. UAE has emerged as a favorable tourist destination, which is helped by the political unrest in other MENA countries. UAE has abundant crude oil reserves. This helps in reducing the operating expense leading to cheaper ticket prices. The huge expatriate labor force from South Asian countries like India, Pakistan and Bangladesh who account for 90% of the country’s private workforce is the main demand driver for UAE aviation. Also, South Asians account for 58% of the population of UAE.  The South Asian markets are attracted by the high quality services provided by Emirates Airlines and Etihad Airways.

India remained Dubai’s single largest contributor to passenger traffic, increasing by 7.4% annually to reach 7.34 million passengers in 2012. Delhi and Mumbai were the busiest routes from UAE and India continued to be the top destination with 750,000 passengers out of a total of 6.28 million passengers (March 2014) passing through Dubai airport. India is one of the underserved markets in the world and has vast growth potential in terms of air traffic. UAE has signed an extensive air services agreement (ASA) with the Government of India which will increase the travel opportunities for Indians and increase the number of flights. The Indian Government hiked the number of seats for the India-Dubai route from 18,400 seats in May 2007 to 54,200 seats in March 2010 to facilitate the demand. The cities Dubai and Abu Dhabi share over 100,000 seats every week to and from India and is expected to increase to over 135,000 seats by 2016. According to Civil Aviation Ministry, Dubai also served as a transit point for 2.68 million Indians in 2011.

Emirates is the largest international airline carrying Indians overseas and 11% of Emirates global network is deployed in India. Emirates operated 185 flights per week to 10 destinations and 26 million passengers have travelled from 2002-2012. India recorded a high seat factor of 84% in 2012. With more than 800,000 Indian expats in Dubai alone, Emirates garnished a market share of 12.3% of international passenger traffic in 2011. In 2011, Emirates carried 14.4% of India’s air freight, and exports to UAE grew by 43.3%.On account of increasing demand due to tourism, Air Arabia is set to announce direct services to Dhaka (Bangladesh), Calicut (India), Peshawar and Lahore (Pakistan) from Ras Al Khaimah. Air Arabia, considering the importance of Nagpur as a growing market, increased the number of flights to four times a week from Nagpur to UAE in 2013. Fly Dubai is launching 10 new flights covering the cities Delhi, Kochi and Trivandrum. With the Government of India permitting overseas carriers to buy stakes up to 49%, new carriers are trying to capitalize on the 1.2 billion population of India. Etihad, the national carrier of UAE, bought 24% stake in Jet Airways to take advantage of the fastest growing market.

<span style="color: #000000;"><span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Pakistan plays a major role in UAE aviation, which is evident by the growing number of travelers between the countries. Etihad runs daily flights from UAE to Karachi, Islamabad, Lahore and twice a week to Peshawar. Etihad will now offer 37 flights weekly from these four major cities. Emirates offers 39 return flights per week from Pakistan to Dubai including 28 flights from Karachi. In 2009-10 Emirates carried more than 420,000 passengers from Pakistan with a load factor of above 80%. Fly Dubai, a low cost carrier, based out of the UAE started its operations in Pakistan in 2010. With the trade between the two countries crossing 9 billion, increasing Pakistani population in UAE, presently at 0.8 million, and with more than 6,000 Pakistani companies registered in UAE, Pakistan proves a viable market for UAE aviation.</span></span>

Emirates operates 21 flights a week and with 400 seats per flight from Dhaka, Bangladesh. Migrant workers accounted for 20% of their passengers in 2011. With increasing demand and low quality of domestic airlines, Air Arabia doubled the flights to Dhaka, daily. It operated 12 flights weekly to Dhaka in 2013. Fly Dubai started its daily service from March 2011 connecting Chittagong with Dubai. Air Arabia and Fly Dubai provide low cost carrier service to migrant workers and their relatives and friends who travel from Dhaka to UAE. UAE airlines see good opportunity in Bangladesh with the growing middle class, increasing number of holiday travelers and growth in exports.

Considering the growing economy of South Asian countries, expanding global network, migrating expatriates and high passenger demand, UAE is all set to become the fastest growing aviation market in the world.

		<Title>[:en]Alternative Energy in Fossil Fuel Rich GCC Countries[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<span style="color: #000000;">The consumption of energy in GCC is driven by high level of urbanization, growing expatriates, fuel subsidises and industrialization. The continuous growth in energy consumption is snowballing into a major issue, as GCC countries are finding it difficult to suffice their own needs. According to World Energy Council, Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is expected to require 100 GW of additional power in next ten years to suffice their domestic consumption requirements.</span>

GCC countries per capita power consumption is amongst the highest in the world (see below figure). In a joint policy research by IFRI and Markaz titled “<a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/kuwait-alternatives-for-power-generation-2013/">Powering Kuwait into 21st Century: Alternatives for Power Generation</a>” rising population and expansion in housing were cited as the primary reasons for the surge in power consumption. The idea is reinforced by the fact that buildings consume 75% of electricity in Kuwait with 65% being utilized for air conditioning purposes alone.

<img class="researchDemand" style="width: 624px; height: 373px;" title="Blog-Infrastructure-Primary-energy-Consumption-per-Capita.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Alternative-Energy-in-Fossil-Fuel-Rich-GCC-Country-Fig1.jpg" alt="Blog-Infrastructure-Primary-energy-Consumption-per-Capita.jpg" />

The Kuwaiti Electricity and Water Ministry estimates that while the power consumption has increased by 8% per annum, power supply has grown only at the rate of 6% per annum and this could lead to demand overshooting supply in the coming years, if measures aren’t taken to boost energy supply. UAE as of now has enough gas to produce 20,000-25,000 MW of electricity but the peak power demand is forecasted to reach 33,400 MW by 2020. Dubai’s power and desalination capacity is set to triple in size by 2015 to reach 16,000 MW and 800 million g/d respectively. Oman uses 19.5 million meter cube of gas to produce power and for desalination per day.

High power consumption apart, water consumption on a per capita basis is also high among GCC countries. To make thing worse the region has scarce water resources – no permanent lakes or rivers, limited groundwater reservoirs; receives scanty rainfall and population has grown faster than the world average. GCC is one of the largest consumers of desalinated water globally with about 99% of the water consumed being produced through desalination, an energy intensive effort working primarily on gas feeds. Demand for water is growing at an accelerated pace, similar to that of power and artificially low tariffs fuelled by subsidies have led to indiscriminate use and subsequent wastage. UAE is one of the world’s largest consumers of water with average per capita consumption at 550 litres per day against World average of 230 litres.

There could be at least USD 100 billion investment in power sector to add up 36 GW of generation capacity by the respective countries. Despite this, the huge demand cannot be satisfied through conventional energy sources alone. While, diesel can be used for peak loads it is not a sustainable option for the long run. Hence, GCC countries are taking active measures towards developing their renewable energy sources. As a first step, towards adoption of renewable energy, it has set itself a target for renewable energy in 2020.

Embracing renewable energy will reap many benefits for GCC region. Realization of the declared renewable energy target can potentially lead to significant job creation across the renewable energy value chain including manufacturing, installation, operation, maintenance and R&amp;D. In order to achieve this there is a need to facilitate renewable energy education and training. Renewable energy can save mammoth of reserves of oil and gas which GCC keeps burning at subsidized rate for power generation. These fuels can rather be used for exporting.

<img class="researchDemand" style="width: 619px; height: 327px;" title="gcc-renewable-energy-target.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Alternative-Energy-in-Fossil-Fuel-Rich-GCC-Country-Fig2.jpg" alt="gcc-renewable-energy-target.jpg" />
Source: Frost &amp; Sullivan analysis of stated targets and plans by GCC countries

Despite the potential, barriers exist that prevent adoption of renewable energy in a big way in GCC. Availability of fossil fuels at highly subsidised rates and lack of renewable friendly regulations are chief amongst them. Regulators need to create a conducive environment that mitigates the investors risk in renewable energy projects. Policies and regulations that promote renewable energy should not only concentrate on large scale projects; but should also be active in promoting small and medium scale projects, such as installing solar panels and solar water heater in cities.

The threat of high return or low risk in other projects can prove to be an impediment for new investments in renewable energy projects. The other key challenge is the ability to integrate this source of energy effectively with the existing transmission and distribution network in an effective and stable manner.

They are certain environmental concerns which arise from the generation of electricity and desalination. Electricity which is energy intensive results in release of pollutants air emissions. Desalination also causes potential environmental impact such as Green House Gas (GHG) Emission due to energy demand of fossil fuels, release of concentrated and chemical discharges which destroys costal water quality and affects marine life. Rejected Brine is discharged as waste water in last stage of desalination and it is highly concentrated. It discharged to the sea changes the salinity, alkalinity and temperature average of sea and it affects the marine life.

GCC countries have abundant thermal heat which could be harvested for use in desalination and electricity generation, through solar concentrating technology and photovoltaic technology, whilst wind energy can be tapped in coastal and islands communities. Only with renewable energy both GHG emission and fossil fuel energy use can potentially be reduced.

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<span style="color: #000000;">According to the ‘GCC <b>Low Cost Carriers</b>’ report published by Markaz, in the recent past, the number of passengers traveling by <b>Low Cost Carriers</b> (LCCs) has grown faster than that of legacy carriers (also known as full-service carriers).</span>

<img class="researchDemand" style="width: 556px; height: 321px;" title="Blog-LCC-Capacity-Share-within-Middle-East.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Legacy-Carriers-vs-Low-Cost-Carriers-fig1.jpg" alt="Blog-LCC-Capacity-Share-within-Middle-East.jpg" />
The report states that LCCs cater to the core need of passengers, which is transporting them from one point to another. LCC carriers have structured their business in such a way so as to reduce their operating costs and the benefits reaped are passed on to customers in the form of lower priced tickets. To reduce costs, the airlines have filled their planes with more seats, standardized their planes or majorly use only one type of aircraft, flew more often, and have strived to fill their seats to capacity. For instance, the entire fleet of Air Arabia is comprised of Airbus A320 type aircraft, making maintenance more efficient and thus enabling cost savings.

Ancillary services such as free baggage and in-flight meals are usually dropped and charges were introduced for the same. Direct ticket sales were encouraged, to cut agent fees and yield management systems, which could sense demand and calibrate ticket prices, were introduced.

<span style="color: #000000;">In order to understand the implications of the LCC business model and how much of a cost difference could such lean operations bring about in air fares, we analysed the air fares for key routes in GCC markets.</span>

<strong>Table 1: Comparison of Air Fares on Key GCC Routes (Fares in USD)</strong>

<span style="color: #000000;"><strong><img class="researchDemand" style="width: 656px; height: 702px;" title="Blog-LCC-Comparison-Air-Fares-on-Key-GCC-Routes.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Legacy-Carriers-vs-Low-Cost-Carriers-fig2.jpg" alt="Blog-LCC-Comparison-Air-Fares-on-Key-GCC-Routes.jpg" /></strong> </span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="line-height: 20px;">Source: Makemytrip.com, One way trip air fares as on Sep 9, 2014</span><br style="line-height: 20px;" /><span style="line-height: 20px;">* All Inclusive fare for an adult, inclusive of Check-in Baggage weighing 20/30Kg</span><br style="line-height: 20px;" /><span style="line-height: 20px;"># Jazeera Airways (LCC) ticket fares are inclusive of check-in baggage weighing 40Kg, while flyDubai charges an additional USD 15 for baggage weighing 20Kg and USD 28 for 30Kg baggage</span></span>

<span style="color: #000000;"><span style="line-height: 20.79px;">In the short-term (travelling within a month of booking), Full Service Carriers (FSC) fares were higher by 50% to 43% over LCC, even after accounting for extra baggage fees in LCC fares. Since the flight duration is less than 2 hours, flight amenities such as in-flight catering may not play a big role in the customer’s choice of flight. </span>
<br style="line-height: 20.79px;" /><span style="line-height: 20.79px;">While in the medium-term, though the rate differential on an average moderated, FSC fares were still higher by 33% over LCC.</span>
<br style="line-height: 20.79px;" /><span style="line-height: 20.79px;">Differential in fares were also found to be route dependent, with the difference being narrower in busier routes such as Dubai-Doha where 28+ flights operate on a daily basis. While passive routes such as Dubai-Muscat, where 13+ flights operate on a daily basis the price gulf were distinctly wide. </span>

Operational efficiency and stricter cost control measures have often been cited as the primary reason for the success of the LCC model. LCC operators usually have above average aircraft utilization rates which enable them to spread across the aircraft costs (higher and fixed in nature). Quicker flight turnaround and increased savings are made possible by having an in-house Maintenance Repair and Operations (MRO) team.

<span style="color: #000000;">In order to understand the implications of the LCC business model and how much of a cost difference could such lean operations bring about in air fares, we analysed the air fares for key routes in GCC markets.</span>

<strong>Table 1: Comparison of Air Fares on Key GCC Routes (Fares in USD)</strong>

<span style="color: #000000;"><strong><img class="researchDemand" style="width: 656px; height: 702px;" title="Blog-LCC-Comparison-Air-Fares-on-Key-GCC-Routes.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Legacy-Carriers-vs-Low-Cost-Carriers-fig2.jpg" alt="Blog-LCC-Comparison-Air-Fares-on-Key-GCC-Routes.jpg" /></strong> </span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="line-height: 20px;">Source: Makemytrip.com, One way trip air fares as on Sep 9, 2014</span><br style="line-height: 20px;" /><span style="line-height: 20px;">* All Inclusive fare for an adult, inclusive of Check-in Baggage weighing 20/30Kg</span><br style="line-height: 20px;" /><span style="line-height: 20px;"># Jazeera Airways (LCC) ticket fares are inclusive of check-in baggage weighing 40Kg, while flyDubai charges an additional USD 15 for baggage weighing 20Kg and USD 28 for 30Kg baggage</span></span>

<span style="color: #000000;"><span style="line-height: 20.79px;">In the short-term (travelling within a month of booking), Full Service Carriers (FSC) fares were higher by 50% to 43% over LCC, even after accounting for extra baggage fees in LCC fares. Since the flight duration is less than 2 hours, flight amenities such as in-flight catering may not play a big role in the customer’s choice of flight. </span>
<br style="line-height: 20.79px;" /><span style="line-height: 20.79px;">While in the medium-term, though the rate differential on an average moderated, FSC fares were still higher by 33% over LCC.</span>
<br style="line-height: 20.79px;" /><span style="line-height: 20.79px;">Differential in fares were also found to be route dependent, with the difference being narrower in busier routes such as Dubai-Doha where 28+ flights operate on a daily basis. While passive routes such as Dubai-Muscat, where 13+ flights operate on a daily basis the price gulf were distinctly wide. </span>

Operational efficiency and stricter cost control measures have often been cited as the primary reason for the success of the LCC model. LCC operators usually have above average aircraft utilization rates which enable them to spread across the aircraft costs (higher and fixed in nature). Quicker flight turnaround and increased savings are made possible by having an in-house Maintenance Repair and Operations (MRO) team.

		<Title>[:en]GCC debt deluge: big-ticket issues, even by international standards[:ar]سندات دول مجلس التعاون الخليجي: عروض كبيرة، حتى على المعايير الدولية[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">The article originally appeared in The National | Business.<br />
<br />
The GCC is raining debt issuances. From almost nothing a few years ago, all we hear and read these days is the jumbo-sized bond issuances from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Abu Dhabi etc. The Saudis just closed a successful US$17.5 billion issue that was oversubscribed by more than four times, while Qatar raised $9bn in May followed by a $5bn sale by Abu Dhabi. Even by international standards, these are big-ticket issues.<br />
<br />
<strong>Why such a sudden rush to issue bonds overseas?</strong><br />
The straight answer should be the growing fiscal deficit or budgetary gap between income and expenses. The IMF expects that GCC deficit to touch nearly $400bn cumulatively between next year and 2021. That&rsquo;s huge in size measured by any standards. Having missed diversification opportunities several times in the past, it is nearly impossible to bridge this gap through non-oil income such as taxes and levies. More importantly raising non-oil revenues through a reduction in subsidies can be contentious and unpopular. Given the welfare economic model where GCC citizens are taken care of from cradle to grave, such sudden rushes to roll back subsidies can unsettle the social contract that the citizens enjoy. Given these constraints, the deficit can only widen or at best remain where the current estimates lie.<br />
<br />
Hence there are only two options: dip into reserves or borrow. Saudi Arabia tried the first method last year, when its reserves drained from $731bn to $615bn. However, it reversed course and resorted to borrowing. It started with domestic borrowing before venturing overseas.<br />
<br />
So why are GCC countries sitting on vast reserves and a deep banking sector and resorting to global bond issuances? The answer to the first question is simple: the opportunity cost of reserves is far higher than the cost at which monies can be raised. In other words, monies parked in reserves earn far more than cost incurred to raise similar sums. Although the Fed is on an interest-rate increase mode, rates are still at very low levels. What better time than now to borrow? Regarding the second question as to why global and not domestic, there is capacity issue for local banks. Also governments may fear that local issuances can crowd out credit growth for the private sector.<br />
<br />
So are these bond issuances a sustainable strategy for the long term? Given the low debt-to-GDP ratio for key GCC countries, this appears a good and sustainable strategy. Overseas leverage levels are becoming unsustainable thanks to Japan (250 per cent of GDP), Europe (91 per cent) and the US (108 per cent). The current debt level of the GCC, at 15 per cent, appears very modest.<br />
<br />
<strong>So what should we be worried about?</strong><br />
Many things. Firstly, increased debt-to-GDP ratio raises the risk of a lower credit rating. Already, Bahrain has fallen from investment grade to junk grade. Rapid deterioration in credit rating will mean higher cost of capital for future issuances. Secondly, credit default swap spreads (an indicator of risk perception) will spike. It is already increasing. Thirdly, the spurt in debt issuances is happening without proper debt management infrastructure. GCC governments should install a well-run debt management office if they have to broad base investors in these bonds. Finally, an active secondary market for these issuances is a must to develop the much-needed yield curve. A GCC secondary market totally dedicated to dealing only in bonds can be a good idea given the scale of bonds to be issued but a lot of work would be needed to build it. This would also help corporates jump on the bandwagon of raising debt. Presently, corporates depend near totally on the banking system.<br />
<br />
So the fruit may be hanging low, but can be sour if not managed properly.</div>[:ar]<div style="text-align: justify;">The article originally appeared in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thenational.ae/business/economy/gcc-debt-deluge-big-ticket-issues-even-by-international-standards" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The National | Business</a>.<br />

		<Title>[:en]Why UAE interest rates are more negative than they appear[:ar]لماذا تكون أسعار الفائدة في الإمارات العربية المتحدة أكثر سلبية مما تبدو عليه[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">The article originally appeared in The National | Business <br />
<br />
Banks in the UAE pay 1.25 per cent on time deposits with a maturity of one year. While this may look measly, two things matter for consideration here.<br />
<br />
First, interest rates are still positive in the UAE, unlike Europe where they turned negative. (Yes, some European banks demand interest from depositors.)<br />
<br />
Second, while the interest received by UAE depositors is positive, this is technically termed as nominal rate. When adjusted for inflation, the real rate of interest gives a different picture. UAE inflation (CPI) is running at 1.8 per cent. After adjusting for inflation, the real rate of interest in the UAE is minus 0.5 per cent.<br />
<br />
This matters because negative real rates are good news for borrowers and bad news for lenders. From individual customers&rsquo; point of view, as depositors they lose out. As borrowers (especially consumer loans), they benefit. For corporates, it presents a great opportunity to clean up the balance sheet, reduce leverage or refinance high- cost loans with low-cost loans.<br />
<br />
The UAE&rsquo;s real rates have been negative since 2009, apart from a brief period between August 2011 and August 2012 when they turned positive. However, what is noticeable is the sharp and continuous descent in the rates since then.<br />
<br />
For rates to turn positive, either nominal interest rates should move up or inflation should move down, or a combination of both. Given the US dollar peg to the dirham, UAE interest rates will mirror that of the US Fed. The Fed has now started raising rates but is finding the going tough. While the expectation is that the rates will rise from here, analysts are confused about the speed.<br />
<br />
Regarding UAE inflation, the possibility of reduced rates can be debated owing to commodity price softening, although a reduction in subsidies can be inflationary. Average inflation since 2009 has been reined in at 1.7 per cent. Hence the UAE should brace for negative real rates of interest for some time to come.<br />
<br />
But why should negative real rates of interest be problematic?</div>
<strong>There are three reasons.</strong>

<ol>
	<li>First, negative real rates would discourage savings, as they would depreciate customer deposits. In simple terms, money deposited today will be worth less in the future, in real terms.
	<ul>
		<li>Consequently, preference for long-term deposits among customers has fallen and deposits at banking institutions, at best, are skewed towards the short end of the curve, a maturity period of one year or less. Time deposits, which accounted for 52 per cent of private deposits in 2007, now account for only 28 per cent.</li>
		<li>As a result, funding profiles of the banks are increasingly short-term in nature, which could constrain their ability to fund projects that are long term in nature owing to duration mismatches. The problem is exacerbated as banks have been the primary suppliers of capital in the region because of a lack of bond markets.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Second, lower lending rates could distort the "hurdle rate" or "break-even rate" by which project investments are evaluated. By holding interest rates artificially low owing to the need to maintain the currency peg, capital might be misallocated. A fall in overall financing costs would tempt borrowers to ignore existing balance sheet problems. If left to persist and prevail, problems such as higher debt would make it hard for central banks to normalize interest rates in the future, for the fear of damage it could inflict.</li>
	<li>Finally, low interest rates have contributed to increased capital outflows from the country. Prolonged lower rates would drag down the yield on domestic assets. A hunt for yields in a low-interest environment could pave the way for speculative activities that could fuel asset bubbles. Further, distortions in asset prices could push investors (both domestic and foreigner) to hunt for higher yields elsewhere, encouraging a flight of capital.</li>

		<Title>[:en]Should GCC banks be wary of Fintech entry?[:ar]هل يجب على المصارف الخليجية أن تكون حذرة من دخول تقنية فينتيك؟[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">The western countries, especially the US, have adopted technology at a much faster pace than the rest of the world. At present, almost 80% of Fintech investment happens in the US, followed by the UK. Developed markets in the Asia Pacific have also been investing and implementing Fintech solutions in recent times. However, adoption in the GCC is still in its infancy. But with growing awareness, Fintech is slowly breaking ground in the region.<br />
&nbsp;</div>
<img alt="What do global banks consider as their biggest threats?" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Should-GCC-banks-be-wary-of-Fintech-entry-fig1.jpg" /><br />
<br />
<strong>Digital-only banking</strong>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Digital-only banking is the new wave that is expected to change the way the banking industry works. In a survey conducted by EY, almost 78% of GCC customers indicated that they would be willing to switch banks for better digital banking experience, and 64% would feel comfortable switching to a digital-first bank.

The cost-per-customer-visit for traditional branch-based banking is multi-fold, compared to digital-only banking. Traditional banks spend an estimated 40-60% of the total operating costs in the maintenance of branch networks, which the digital-only banks eliminate. Fintech firms are a threat to traditional banks that offer similar services at a much higher cost. These firms have already begun cannibalizing on the traditional banks&rsquo; customer base, thereby pressurizing the margins of the latter.<br />

<strong>Remittance</strong>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Global remittance industry was estimated to be worth close to $650bn, at the end of 2015, and is growing at a CAGR of 3.75%. Saudi Arabia and UAE occupy the second and third spot in global remittance send volume, accounting for a combined USD 74bn, majority of which goes to India (USD 23bn), followed by Pakistan (USD 9bn) and Philippines (USD 7bn). According to the World Bank, the cost of sending money home to diaspora averages 7.7% globally. &nbsp;But Fintech players are emerging in the horizon, leveraging on online and mobile platforms, and have increased the pressure on banks by charging an average fee of 0.9%; much less than the average for banks (global average). In 2015, the cost of sending remittances to the MENA region decreased 95bps from 8.37% to 7.42%.</div>

<strong>P2P Lending</strong>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Beehive, a Dubai-based sharia compliant P2P lender, is the UAE&rsquo;s first online platform for lenders and borrowers. It provides low cost finance to SMEs, while providing a direct access to alternative asset classes that can potentially generate higher returns to investors. According to Beehive, people just invest 5% of their net wealth on such platforms, but witness returns of 15%-20%, on an average. This has encouraged more than 2,000 investors to register with the platform in the UAE, which has successfully completed 100 deals since inception. P2P lending could change the way lenders and borrowers interact in the future, in both the retail and commercial banking spaces, as it offers attractive returns for lenders and cost efficiency for the borrowers. Platforms such as Beehive can serve as a funding source for the Small and medium enterprises (SMEs), though they might not be able to replace banks in funding big ticket corporate credit.</div>
<br />
<strong>Islamic Finance</strong>

<div style="text-align: justify;">According to Marmore&rsquo;s report on &lsquo;Fintech in GCC&rsquo;, one of the biggest potential impacts of Fintech will be on Islamic finance. Fintech could potentially increase the reach of Islamic financial services, and provide more choices that suit individual needs at competitive cost. SMEs that find it hard to obtain sharia-compliant bank funding from Islamic Financial Institutions (IFIs) could look to Fintech firms to fill that gap. Fintech&rsquo;s penetration into Islamic finance is expected to intensify competition among traditional IFIs. &nbsp;Some of the Islamic finance players that have ventured into Fintech include Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank (ADIB), Dubai Islamic Bank (DIB), and National Bonds, a shariah-compliant savings and investment firm. ADIB has teamed up with IBM to build a digital studio that will work on digital innovation projects across the bank. Conventional Islamic banks seek to expand their presence in the Fintech space by adopting technology in their service offerings.</div>
<br />
<strong>Crowdfunding</strong>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Fintech firms have created platforms for lenders and borrowers to meet, without the need for a middleman, which in many cases are traditional banks. Crowdfunding and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending are the new buzzwords among borrowers in recent years. In 2015, the global crowdsourcing market was expected to have grown by an estimated 112%, to reach a value of $34.4bn. The GCC region has also witnessed the emergence and the growth of the crowd funding concept, and experts opine that crowd funding would continue to grow due to dearth of venture capital and public offerings for entrepreneurs. For instance, a UAE-based platform, Eureeca, calls itself a crowd-investing arena, as it allows interested investors to view profiles of available projects to invest in. In return, the investors will gain shares in the businesses, in which they make their investments. Investors might divert more money into these crowd funding platforms for better returns and borrowers will have an alternative avenue apart from the traditional banks. Crowdfunding might impact private equity firms in GCC, as start-ups might find it as an easy alternative to raise capital.</div>
<br />
<strong>Conclusion</strong>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Fintech firms have already made their presence felt across the globe, with innovations such as digital remittances, robo-advisory, algorithmic trading, and P2P insurance and lending platforms. Surprisingly Banking and Financial Services Industry (BFSI), the biggest and most prominent sector in the GCC, is yet prepare for the entry of Fintech in the region, as potential competition. In the coming years, the demand from consumers is expected to give rise to faster adoption of these technologies across various verticals in BFSI. Traditional banking and financial service players will have to improve their operational efficiency by cutting down on needless expenditure, adopt technology, where possible, and improve their asset quality, if they wish to compete with their digital cousins.</div>[:ar]<div style="text-align: justify;">The western countries, especially the US, have adopted technology at a much faster pace than the rest of the world. At present, almost 80% of Fintech investment happens in the US, followed by the UK. Developed markets in the Asia Pacific have also been investing and implementing Fintech solutions in recent times. However, adoption in the GCC is still in its infancy. But with growing awareness, Fintech is slowly breaking ground in the region.<br />

<br />
<strong>Digital-only banking</strong>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Digital-only banking is the new wave that is expected to change the way the banking industry works. In a survey conducted by EY, almost 78% of GCC customers indicated that they would be willing to switch banks for better digital banking experience, and 64% would feel comfortable switching to a digital-first bank. Unlike traditional banking, which is more branch-centric, digital-only banks would avail them more independence in utilizing the services offered by the bank.</div>

		<Title>[:en]VAT in the GCC - How should companies prepare?[:ar]كيف تستعد الشركات تجاه - ضريبة القيمة المضافة في دول مجلس التعاون الخليجي؟[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">Preliminary details reveal that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Qatar will be the first states in the GCC to adopt the new tax regime in January 2018. But, all members of the GCC are anticipated to implement VAT by the close of 2018. It is notable that certain essential food items and socially-oriented sectors such as healthcare and education will be exempt from the VAT regime.<br />
<br />
The approval of the GCC VAT means that the countries and the business enterprises operating in them will face a tight timeline of 18 months to prepare for the opening phase of VAT implementation by January 1, 2018. It is expected that the rate will be low, likely around the 5% mark (Ministry of Finance of the UAE). As a general consumption tax, VAT will apply to the majority of commercial transactions in goods and services.<br />
<br />
When VAT goes into effect, it will mean that businesses will be responsible for diligently documenting their business revenue and costs and related VAT charges. Registered businesses and traders will apply VAT to all of their clients or customers at the prevailing rate and incur VAT on goods / services that they purchase from suppliers. There are indications that the GCC is taking the implementation of the VAT very diligently, since it will help in diversifying the income bases of the various countries. According to the UAE Ministry of Finance, rules that mandate businesses to be clear about how much VAT is being paid for each transaction will be included. This means that businesses will possess the required information to decide whether to purchase something or not.<br />
<br />
Given the momentous development, business owners in the GCC will have to prepare at multiple levels. It should be noted that not all businesses will have to register for VAT. Businesses that meet a certain minimum annual turnover specification will have to register for VAT. This means that many small businesses will not have to register for VAT. Thus, small businesses will not have to face the rigorous documentation and reporting that a tax regime like VAT needs. Moreover, businesses will not have to register with the government if they only offer goods and services that are not subject to VAT.<br />
<br />
Various GCC governments have not finalized and announced the specific conditions (such as minimum yearly turnover) that will aid in identifying businesses that do not have to register for VAT. For companies that will come under the VAT regime, the following responsibilities or actions will generally apply:</div>

<ul>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">Charging VAT on taxable goods or services they sell;</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">Reclaiming, if eligible, any VAT they&rsquo;ve paid on their goods or services sold;</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">Documenting and maintaining an array of business records that will allow responsible government agencies to verify the data and information with respect to the processes.</li>
</ul>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Preparing for VAT for businesses is a complex activity and should be addressed as early as possible in order to avoid last minute hassles. From the time of the official announcement of the VAT, businesses have 18 months of preparation time before the regime will come into effect. During the 18 months, businesses will have to address requirements to meet their tax obligations. To fully and successfully comply with VAT, businesses will have to make changes to their core operations (like supply chains), the financial management and book-keeping systems, the underlying technology for documenting and processing data and information, and may be even the human resource mix (e.g., bringing in more accountants and tax advisors).<br />
<br />
Since the final responsibility and total accountability to comply with VAT is on the registered business, it is essential that enterprise financial records are accurate and fully updated. It may be prudent for businesses that are not VAT registered to maintain detailed financial records in any event, so that they can comply with the VAT regime if any change in policy suddenly brings them into the VAT bracket. Once the VAT is in place, VAT-registered business have to report the amount of VAT that they charge and the amount of VAT they pay to the government on a periodic basis.<br />
<br />
The reporting or submissions will be a formal process; and probably, the submissions are likely to be made online (i.e., e-capable) in the case of many GCC countries. If a business is charged more VAT than they have paid, the difference will then have to be paid to the government. Conversely, if a business has paid more VAT than it has been charged, then the difference can be reclaimed. Thus, in light of the complexity and the detailed processes underpinning VAT, businesses will need to take the following steps to prepare to meet their VAT commitments (Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited).</div>

<ul>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">Studying and understanding VAT registration requirements and the process of making an application for a VAT registration number.</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">Ensuring that the pertinent books and records are maintained in the mandated manner.</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">If needed, negotiating and revising terms of business with customers for ensuring that VAT becomes a cost to purchasers; and not to suppliers.</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">Organize enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems for ensuring their operational preparedness to meet the charging and recovery processes of VAT.</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">Preparing the capability for manual VAT accounting processes, if no centralized ERP system is in place or cannot be afforded.</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">Structuring invoicing templates afresh to ensure that new fields needed for VAT accounting are included.</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">Due diligence of the entire finance and accounting function in order to maintain keener oversight of company cash-flows, particularly in relation with intercompany transactions.</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">Taking stock of whether skill sets needed in terms of tax expertise need to be brought in or contracted.</li>
</ul>

<div style="text-align: justify;">For businesses in the GCC, VAT will necessitate a range of continuous activities. Unlike the case of corporate income tax, wherein returns are filed on an annual basis, VAT mandates monthly or quarterly filing of returns and payments. Thus, GCC companies will have to prepare themselves across various areas in order to meet VAT requirements in a stress-free manner.<br />

		<Title>[:en]Planned GCC remittance tax could cost members economies in the long run[:ar]يمكن أن تكلف ضريبة التحويلات المالية الخليجية المخطط لها دول الأعضاء على المدى الطويل[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">Though the idea is enticing and could &ndash; assuming a flat-rate remittance tax of 10 per cent &ndash; add US$10 billion to the non-oil income of the GCC region on an aggregate basis, the introduction of such as tax has more downsides, in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Transfer of money by foreign workers to their home countries represents a significant financial outflow from GCC countries. The World Bank estimates that more than $100bn left the GCC last year in the form of remittances from the millions of expatriates who work there. This represents 7.7 per cent of the countries&rsquo; combined GDP, a significant number compared with the United States, where remittances account for 0.7 per cent of GDP, or the United Kingdom, at 0.9 per cent.<br />
<br />
A simple reason for this high value of remittance outflow could be the lack of investment opportunities, especially in property and stocks, for foreigners. While the stock markets of the UAE and Qatar have opened up for foreigners, most of them are still out of bounds for foreign retail investors. This lack of opportunity to invest coupled with a lack of taxes only serve to make workers cash-rich and increase the incentive for them to remit and instead make investments in their home countries.<br />
<br />
Most of the 25 million expatriates in the Gulf region originate from countries such as India, Egypt, the Philippines, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Yemen. Typically they work as drivers, cooks, construction labourers, security guards and in other low-skill jobs. In the short term, the introduction of taxes would reduce the incentive to send remittances by migrant workers and may achieve the desired purpose.<br />
<br />
At the same time, the introduction of remittance taxes could drive people to avoid official channels of remittances such as banks. They could instead prefer to remit through friends, relatives or colleagues who are travelling. The chance of people resorting to black-market remittance channels would also increase.<br />
<br />
In the long term, the reduced opportunity to send money back home could dissipate the attractiveness of GCC labour markets for Asian workers. This could have significant implications.<br />
<br />
The GCC economic model is based on foreign workers, especially semi-skilled and low-skilled labour. Expatriates account for more than 50 per cent of the labour force in most of the GCC countries. In Qatar, where large-scale infrastructure projects are under way, the expatriate workforce is as high as 85 per cent of the total labour market.<br />
<br />
Disincentivising such a large component of the economy may impose long-term costs that can far outweigh the short-term benefits.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thus, the remittance tax at best is largely cost-elastic and its introduction would be regressive for the economy. Studies that have been done on remittance outflow in the region portray it to be advantageous for Gulf, acting as a significant deflationary force &ndash; first, by keeping consumer demand in check, as expatriate labourers often lead a frugal life to increase their remittances and, second, by providing a constant influx of low-wage expatriates.<br />
<br />
In this context, the socio-economic impact of introducing a remittance tax could be better researched before arriving at a decision.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If, however, remittances are still viewed as leaks in the economy, governments should introduce measures &ndash; such as incentivising domestic investments, opening up the economy and market for foreigners and increased opportunities to get families together &ndash; that would decrease the desire to remit in the first place.<br />

If, however, remittances are still viewed as leaks in the economy, governments should introduce measures &ndash; such as incentivising domestic investments, opening up the economy and market for foreigners and increased opportunities to get families together &ndash; that would decrease the desire to remit in the first place.<br />

<strong>GCC Investors have flocked into British Real Estate</strong>
Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) & private investors from gulf, particularly Qatar, Kuwait, KSA and UAE, have purchased prolific properties in Britain, largely in London. Indeed, a part of London is referred to as ‘Qatar Quarter’ due to the sizeable investments made by Qataris. London-based Rokstone estate agent estimates that Qataris own property worth more than one billion pounds (USD 1.34mn) in Mayfair, one of London's richest areas.

<strong>Quantum of Investments </strong>
Total investments made by gulf investors in Britain are estimated to be about USD 200bn, of which USD 45bn (23% of total) could be in real estate (CNBC Arabiya). Moreover, Britain is believed to account for as much as 40 percent of all Gulf investments in European property.

As of April 2016, Qatar's total investments in Britain were around 30 billion pounds (USD 44bn) (Financial Times). Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), apart from owning landmark properties such as Shard skyscraper, Harrods department store, Olympic village, and complexes in Canary Wharf financial district, also holds stake worth USD 5.3bn in direct equities which trade in LSE.

Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) is also a major investor through its London-based Kuwait Investment Office. In 2013, it said the fund had more than doubled its investment in Britain over the previous 10 years to more than USD 24bn. Like Qatar, Kuwait owns London landmarks such as the 13-acre More One development (bought for USD 2.7bn) on the south bank of river Thames which houses the headquarters of the mayor, as well as buildings in Canary Wharf. It has also focused on infrastructure investments through its Wren House Infrastructure Management arm set up in 2013.

Investors from the UAE accounted for more than 20 percent of buy-to-let property sales in the UK in 2015 (Chestertons).

<strong>Performance of London Properties</strong>
London real estate is one of the most sought after investment due to its unparalleled connectivity, political stability, transparency and clear titles and varied economic opportunities that it offers. It is also one of the most liquid real estate markets in the world. Historically, property values in central London’s most expensive neighbourhoods had increased by 4.6% year-on-year while rental yields – returns from rental income – had averaged 3.7%. In the past seven years, investors in London real estate had benefited from 70% growth, and it is expected to achieve a cumulative capital growth of 19.1% over the next five years (Cluttons).

The fall in value of pound against GCC currencies (which are mostly pegged to U.S dollar) would directly reduce the value of investments by 8-10%. Continued inflow to safe haven assets such as U.S treasury would steadily rise the value of dollar against British Pounds.

<strong>What will happen to Real Estate Investments in Britain?</strong>
The fall in pound’s value will directly affect the investments made by GCC investors. If Britain’s economy plunges into recession, business investments would be curtailed, and demand for commercial real estate would be depressed. In such a scenario, Bank of England would further lower its interest rates and inject liquidity to revive economy.

As a result, in the near-term, combination of negative sentiments and fall in currency value would weigh on asset prices. In the mid-term, this could draw attention from overseas investors, who enticed by Britain stature as a G-7 member nation with a strong track record of achieving economic growth, might look to acquire assets.

As the dust settles, in the long-term, underpinned by fundamental qualities of Britain such as 60mn wealthy consumers, skilled workforce, stable governance, GMT time zone would augur well for the economy and investments.

<strong>Impact of Brexit on Real Estate Value</strong>
Realty agents and analysts opine the exit from EU would end the housing boom in Britain bringing the price rises to an abrupt halt as the consumer confidence would take a beating due to continued uncertainty, expectations of slowing economy and growing unemployment. Office realty is bound to be affected where construction projects (new supply) are at a record high.

<strong>Short-term performance remain muted due to Brexit fears </strong>
In the near term, value of residential property in upmarket areas popular among Gulf investors - including Chelsea, South Kensington and Knightsbridge - fell 3.5% to 7.5% for the year in May (Knight Frank). According to the Bank of England, overall flows of foreign capital into commercial real estate in Britain stopped in the first three months of 2016. Further, transactions in commercial property fell by 40 per cent in the first quarter. Realty transactions are bound to be thin as buyers would prefer to ‘wait and watch’.

Commercial real estate, especially office spaces, would be hit as multinational organizations reassess their strategy to stay in London, which so far had served as a gateway for EU markets. It is estimated that over 100,000 jobs could be relocated out of London and as a result office rents could drop by as much as 18% in the next two years (Jefferies (Mike Prew), sourced from Financial Times).

<strong>London as a Financial Hub could be Threatened</strong>
HSBC has already moved staff to Birmingham and Credit Suisse plans to slash thousands of jobs. JPMorgan has earlier warned that a vote to leave could lead it to cut jobs and there's a chance other U.S. investment banks would follow suit. GCC Banks which have their subsidiaries in London might reassess their strategy or may downsize their operations in London and relocate to continental Europe.

<strong>Real Estate Deals could be held back</strong>
Investors were still working on deals without finalising them until the picture becomes clear. Uncertainties about the legal and regulatory framework that would result from a Brexit is a worry. For instance, QIA is considering abandoning the sale of 1 Cabot Square, an office building in London’s Canary Wharf financial district leased to Credit Suisse Group AG. The 546,114-square-foot (50,736 sq mt) office block, was put on the market earlier this year, is valued at about 450 million pounds (USD 594mn). It was the first major property offered for sale by QIA since its creation in 2005 (Bloomberg).

<strong>Exposure to Equities in LSE</strong>
QIA’s portfolio includes Barclays (4.8% stake), Sainsbury’s (25% stake), London Stock Exchange (10.3% stake) and Royal Dutch Shell (0.9% stake) among others (overall USD 5.3 bn). Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) exposure is worth USD 2.78bn which are spread among 109 stocks. KIA, on the hand has a direct exposure of only USD 0.58bn in listed equities that are spread among 35 stocks which are traded in LSE (Reuters).

<img title="Overall Impact on GCC Investments" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Brexit_GCC_Investments_Britain_fig5.jpg" alt="Overall Impact on GCC Investments" />

<strong>Way Forward</strong>
Currency devaluation and lower interest rates could spur inflation over the medium-term. Moreover, Britain’s economy, underpinned by over 60million wealthy consumers and a skilled workforce, will have plenty of economic opportunities to offer. In such a scenario, real estate investments will prove to be fruitful.

Having said that, it shall be prudent to further diversify investments into regions such as continental Europe, U.S and Asia. For instance, QIA has already embarked on such approach. QIA which hitherto had heavily invested in Britain is investing more into U.S and Asia in the last couple of quarters.

<div style="text-align: justify;">GCC markets remained relatively unscathed except for UAE markets; Dubai index lost 3.3% while Abu Dhabi lost 1.8%. Dubai being largely a service economy driven by trade & services, tourism and real estate witnessed a fall as British pound lost 7.2% in value against UAE Dirham. Investor&rsquo;s feared the depreciation of pound against AED would affect real estate investments and tourist&rsquo;s inflow from Britain. Among non-GCC investors in Dubai, after Indians nationals, British nationals had invested AED 10billion (USD 2.7bn) in Dubai real estate in 2015 according to data from Dubai Land Department. Tourism inflow from Britain to the GCC would also get impacted on account of the depreciating GBP.<br />

<div style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<strong>How significant is Brexit?</strong><br />
In order to assess the significance of Brexit event we compare the equity volatility levels over the years. As seen in the figure, the equity volatility index implies an anxiety level that is much lower than the ones witnessed recently such as Chinese yen devaluation or the scare in February, 2016 when U.S Fed announced they wouldn&rsquo;t rule out negative interest rates after Bank of Japan introduced negative rates.<br />
<br />
<img alt="Figure: CBOE Equity Market Volatility Index" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Brexit-impact-on-GCC-fig3.jpg" /><br />
<br />
<strong>Impact on GCC&rsquo;s Economy </strong><br />
Britain exit from European Union has added an element of uncertainty that could further dampen global economic growth by delaying capital expenditures and sapping global consumer confidence. Impact on oil would be minimal since Britain consumes only 1.6% of global consumption and ranks 15&nbsp;among global consumers. The more serious impact would be if there is contagion to the rest of the&nbsp;European Union. Further, as capital shifts into safe haven assets such as U.S treasuries, it would lead to further strengthening of U.S dollar. . Stronger U.S dollar would make imports from Britain cheaper as most of the GCC currencies are pegged to U.S dollar. GCC imports a lot of&nbsp;luxury cars from UK&nbsp;manufacturers&nbsp;such as Bentley, Aston Martin etc. which would all become cheaper. Capital equipment imports from Britain for other sectors such as telecom, power etc. would also become cheaper.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The uncertainty caused by Brexit outcome would act as a headwind to global growth, particularly in the U.S, and as a result U.S Fed could delay increasing their interest rates. Lower interest rates for longer bodes well for GCC economies as it helps to revive their economies which are bruised by the fall in oil prices. GCC governments could act swiftly to raise capital from international bonds before the rates start rising again.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Protectionist policy to the fore</strong><br />
One of the important implications of the vote is that the positive effects of globalization have not trickled down to all. The growing inequality as a result of stagnating incomes, especially for low skilled workers, due to technological advances resulting in plateauing of labour productivity has led to displeasures among the voting majority. They largely feel threatened by trade and immigration policies and fear their jobs are either being replaced by immigrants or outsourced to people in emerging countries. Backlash on globalization doesn&rsquo;t bode for emerging markets and in particular GCC economies as they have largely benefitted from free flow of capital, labour and goods.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Impact on GCC&#39;s Investments in British Real Estate</strong><br />
Realty agents and analysts opine the exit from EU would end the housing boom in Britain bringing the price rises to an abrupt halt.

&nbsp;<br />
Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) and HNIs in GCC are known to invest&nbsp;heavily in London&#39;s real estate. For instance, Investors from the UAE accounted for more than 20% of buy-to-let&nbsp;property sales in the UK in 2015. Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) is among the high-profile investors in London real estate, snapping up landmarks such as the Shard&nbsp;skyscraper, Harrods department store and Olympic Village (Reuters). Value of their holdings would be marked down due to the fall in pound value. The ensuing uncertainty would lead to investors demanding a premium, subsequently, the prices could further decline.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
On the other hand, a steep fall in real estate prices in Britain (especially London) may also see fresh investments from GCC into the country on account of bottom fishing.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Impact on Trade with GCC</strong><br />
GCC region has been in talks with EU region for over 25 years and the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the regions is still pending. Having lost of access to EU, Britain to sustain its exports would be aggressive to sign bilateral trade deals. This presents an opportunity for GCC regions, especially Dubai, as it acts as a trading hub for MENA region as well as a gateway for African continent. Establishing bilateral trading agreement with Britain would be possible and this is a positive for GCC economies<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Impact on GCC Equities</strong><br />
GCC equities may continue to fall in the short-term, in line with global trends, as risk aversion engulfs investor sentiments. However, we feel the direct impact of Brexit is minimal on GCC equities as their earnings prospects are little affected by the event. As a result, we expect equities to gradually recover as their movements are largely dictated by domestic factors and oil prices.<br />

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">Three questions predominate the narrative:</div>
<ol>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Is the current fall in oil price cyclical or structural?</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">When can we see a strong rebound? (2016 or 2017 or beyond) &</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Can GCC survive a long spell of low oil price?</li>
</ol>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

In fact, the second question is related to the first question. If the current fall in oil price is structural, then we cannot expect any strong rebound. So, may be implicitly we should pray that this is just a cyclical phenomenon. From a mean reversion perspective, a period of low oil price should be succeeded by period of improving strong oil price and hence it may not be out of place to expect a rebound since we have been suffering from low oil price for some time now. Also, with trillions of reserves earned during good times, GCC may be well entrenched to whither the oil storm for longer than we think. So why worry about oil price?

The answer lies in demography and welfare state model of GCC. Both of them will make sure that government expenditure is on the rise which implies requiring higher oil price to balance the budgets. As population grows at a healthy rate (emphasis youth population), the pressure on infrastructure investments, job creation and essential services (education and healthcare) increases manifold. Surround this with challenging geopolitical situation, you can guess the answer. The answer to the challenges enumerated above does not lie in high oil price as we have figured out by now. The answer lies in creating meritocratic institutions that focusses on nurturing innovation and creativity. The answer lies in fostering reforms across the board so that doing business even by local family businesses gets lot easier and cheaper. GCC should restructure their economic business model in such a manner that it no longer depends on just one commodity for its survival. We should use the oil industry to champion the change. We should focus on reduction of wasteful expenditure rather than augmenting non-oil income (through subsidy rationalization and taxes). While subsidy rationalization is essential (given the extremely low pricing of services), it should succeed efforts to augment efficiency in the existing model which can reign in extraordinary savings.

GCC must embark on a path that will make those 3 questions redundant in the next 10 years. Enjoy the issue of Marmore’s Bulletin Q2 May, 2016 recently published.
</div>[:ar]<div style="text-align: justify;">Three questions predominate the narrative:</div>
<ol>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Is the current fall in oil price cyclical or structural?</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">When can we see a strong rebound? (2016 or 2017 or beyond) &</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Can GCC survive a long spell of low oil price?</li>
</ol>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

In fact, the second question is related to the first question. If the current fall in oil price is structural, then we cannot expect any strong rebound. So, may be implicitly we should pray that this is just a cyclical phenomenon. From a mean reversion perspective, a period of low oil price should be succeeded by period of improving strong oil price and hence it may not be out of place to expect a rebound since we have been suffering from low oil price for some time now.

		<Title>[:en]Saudi Arabia and its US dollar peg dilemma[:ar]المملكة العربية السعودية ومشكلتها الخاصة بتثبيت الدولار الأمريكي[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">Most GCC countries are pegged to the US dollar to avoid currency fluctuation and eliminate uncertainties in international transactions (Kuwait is pegged to a basket of currencies dominated by the US dollar).<br />
<br />
This comes at the expense of monetary policy flexibility. Stable domestic currency and a fixed exchange rate imply that traders do not have to face currency risks, and therefore will be more willing to invest and facilitate trade. Since oil is the chief commodity in the GCC, and the oil price is fixed in dollars, any exchange rate fluctuation could drastically reduce revenue if the currencies were unpegged.<br />
<br />
With the US economy expanding, the Federal Reserve has begun hiking interest rates gradually, and plans to achieve a target of 3 per cent by the end of 2018.<br />
<br />
While the US is expected to ride a growth wave over the next few years, the GCC economies, especially the oil exporters, are facing contraction because of low oil prices. Declining oil revenue, subdued global growth, liquidity crunch and geo&shy;political issues are some of the challenges facing the region.<br />
<br />
These differences are starker in countries such as Saudi Arabia, the world&rsquo;s largest oil producer and exporter, where more than 73 per cent of government revenues come from the hydrocarbon sector, according to the Institute of International Finance industry group.<br />
<br />
In such a scenario, Saudi Arabia can either follow the monetary policy direction set by the US or deviate from it.<br />
<br />
If it opts for the former, the kingdom maintains the peg but sacrifices its growth, as it will tighten monetary conditions during a period of low growth. According to the kingdom&rsquo;s central bank, the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (Sama), a 100 basis point increase in the Saudi Interbank Offered Rate (Sibor) leads to a decline of 90 basis points in GDP in the subsequent quarter and 95 basis points in the quarter after that.<br />
<br />
If it opts for the latter, then there will be a gap in interest rates between the US and Saudi Arabia, leading to arbitrage opportunities. To counter this, Sama will have to buy Saudi &shy;riyals in the open market by selling US dollars from its reserves. And as the Fed increases the interest rate, Sama has to keep depleting its forex reserves until it runs out of dollars. Hence there is a cost involved with &shy;either choice.<br />
<br />
The oil price fall since mid-2014, has reduced the kingdom&rsquo;s revenue, incurring a deficit of $98bn in 2015, and it is estimating a further $87bn deficit in 2016. The Saudi government had funded this deficit by drawing down its central bank deposits, reducing its forex reserves to $602bn; a drop of $132bn, in the year to this January.<br />
<br />
During the last Fed hike, Saudi Arabia, along with &shy;other GCC countries, raised its interest rates tracking the US monetary policy. According to Moody&rsquo;s, the kingdom has large foreign currency reserves that provide ample room to maintain the pegged exchange rate regime for several years, even in an adverse oil price scenario. At present, Sama holds about 80 per cent of its investments in US Treasury bills.<br />
<br />
While this should have been a clear indication of Sama&rsquo;s dir&shy;ection, early this year the forwards market for the Saudi riyal sprang to life with speculation that the kingdom could be forced to abandon its three- decade peg to the US dollar. The market expected a 12-month forward exchange rate of 3.85 riyals to the dollar, a 2.7 per cent devaluation from the 3.75 level that has, in essence, held since 1986.<br />
<br />
Sama doused the speculation by reiterating that it will continue to stick with its currency peg, and ordered banks in the kingdom to stop offering options contracts on riyal forwards to their clients.<br />
<br />
Other GCC countries with sufficient SWF assets and central bank reserves, such as Kuwait, Qatar and the UAE, could also maintain the peg with little difficulty.<br />
<br />
However, Oman and Bahrain do not enjoy this luxury, and could potentially run out of reserves in less than three years. Both these countries have resorted to issuing debt to extend the longevity of their reserves.<br />
<br />
For Saudi Arabia, speculation about the possibility of depegging its currency from the US dollar may have been premature, but it has provided an opportunity to analyse the costs incurred by the kingdom in maintaining the peg, and whether an alternative exists to the current scenario. While the low oil price does not seem to have affected the peg much, thanks to the presence of ample forex reserves, it could have severe repercussions in the future, if the low prices persist.<br />
<br />
Looking ahead, cost benefit analysis, stress and scenario testing are a must to gauge the extent to which the status quo is preferable. While the advantages of maintaining the peg are manifold, so are the costs. Ergo, Saudi must also chart out a road map and prepare for a time where depegging from the US dollar is a preferable option to continuing with an expensive peg.<br />

		<Title><![CDATA[[:en]Top GCC Risks for 2016 & Beyond[:ar]أكبر المخاطر التي واجهت دول مجلس التعاون الخليجي في عام 2016 وما بعده[:]]]></Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Oil: When will this slide end?</strong><br />
With the oil price hovering around $35 per barrel the question remains as to how much longer can OPEC continue with its current policy of pumping as much oil as it can in a quest to win more market share and drive out high cost producers. OPEC member countries produce around 37% of the global crude oil, and disagreements over production ceilings have already affected some of the members. Some of the big producers, such as Venezuela, Nigeria and Algeria that rely on oil exports for their revenue, do not have the luxury of oil surpluses, and are facing widening fiscal and current account deficits. Even for GCC exporters, assuming low oil prices persist, public foreign assets could decline substantially over the next 5 years, while gross public debt could rise to 59% of GDP.&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<img alt="GCC_Risks_2016_Fig1.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GCC_Risks_2016_Fig1.jpg" style="width: 751px; height: 510px;" title="GCC_Risks_2016_Fig1.jpg" /><br />
<br />
After clocking more than a trillion dollars annually in export revenues during the period 2012-2014, GCC economies will witness a 23% fall in export revenues in 2015 mainly driven by Saudi Arabia, which accounts for close to half the estimated USD 250bn loss. Lower revenues for the government along with weakening balance sheets could spill over to the broader economy, if the situation persists over a longer time frame.<br />
<br />
<strong>Fed Rate Hike</strong><br />
US interest rates were finally hiked by 25bps on 16 Dec 2015, with the Fed raising the range of its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to between 0.25% and 0.50%, and further rate hikes expected in 2016, with the median projected target of 1.375%. Barring Qatar, other GCC countries followed the monetary policy cues issued by the US Fed, for the most part, but will this conformity continue going forward is anybody&rsquo;s guess.<br />
<br />
Some GCC countries have rejected notions of moving away from the US peg, which implies that monetary policy cues will continue to be taken from the Fed. But the extent of this could be dictated by local economic conditions, as countries such as Oman and Saudi continue facing currency pressures.<br />
<br />
<strong>Wobbly China </strong><br />
China&rsquo;s borrowing binge post the 2008 global financial crisis has led to burgeoning rise in credit, which rose from 134% of GDP in 2007 to 240% of GDP at the end of Q3 2015, and a period of slow economic growth only magnifies the indebtedness. China&#39;s banking regulator has claimed that new non-performing loans (NPL) held by Chinese banks more than doubled in 2015 from the previous year.<br />
<br />
Depreciation of the yuan puts pressure on other central banks around the world to push down their own currencies to help their own exporters and to prevent destabilizing capital flows. According to various sources, China is mulling a 15%-20% devaluation of its currency by the end of 2016, and economic slowdown, coupled with depreciating yuan, is expected to lead to further capital outflows from China.<br />
<br />
GCC trade with China grew more rapidly during 2010-13 than with any other significant trade partner, at a rate of over 30% for exports and 17% for imports. How China fares in 2016 will have far-reaching consequences across the globe, and especially in the GCC.<br />
<br />
<strong>Emerging Market Crises</strong><br />
Investors are exiting debt-laden emerging markets,&nbsp;having pulled out close to $30.5 billion from Asian stock and debt markets by the end of Nov 2015; the largest outflow since the financial crisis. Lending conditions have begun to tighten, which when combined with deteriorating corporate profits, puts a question mark on the refinancing of existing debt, $600 billion of which is maturing in 2016.<br />
<br />
A wave of currency devaluationas have affected the emerging markets, with China, Vietnam, Thailand etc. lowering their currencies against the US dollar, in order to make their exports more competitive. Many EM currencies are also vulnerable due to weak macroeconomic fundamentals, and rising capital outflows, with Greece, South Africa, Argentina, Hungary and Turkey at the precipice of another crisis.<br />
<br />
Commodity producing nations are at a higher risk, but countries with sufficient domestic demand, such as India and Philippines are expected to be better off. But the overall scenario in emerging markets points towards a slowdown and not a meltdown.<br />
<br />
<strong>Geopolitical Risks</strong><br />
With rising geopolitical issues in the region, weapons imports have risen, with Saudi Arabia now receiving 7% of international arms imports, second only to India (14%). Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s arms imports have rocketed by 275% in the last five years, and the country&rsquo;s military expenditure is among the top 5 in the world. Geopolitical tensions also cause social unrest such as those that occurred during the Arab Spring. Need for social appeasement will make the task of cutting subsidies difficult for many countries in the region.<br />
<br />
Recently, Standard & Poor&#39;s cut ratings and outlook of several oil producing countries in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia, when the GCC nations are planning to issue bonds in both domestic and international markets to bridge the widening deficit. Worsening geopolitics would increase cost of capital for both sovereign and corporates. Another major fallout would be the fall in perception of GCC, among multi-nationals who wish to capitalize on the fast growth witnessed thus far.</div>[:ar]<div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Oil: When will this slide end?</strong><br />

		<Title><![CDATA[[:en]Kuwait Economic Themes & Investment Implications 2016[:ar]الموضوعات الاقتصادية ونتائج الاستثمار لدولة الكويت لعام 2016[:]]]></Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<img alt="Kuwait_fig1.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kuwait-Economic-Themes-Fig1.jpg" style="width: 650px; height: 526px;" title="Kuwait_fig1.jpg" />Acording to Marmore&rsquo;s Kuwait economic themes report, Kuwait continues to be extremely reliant on oil for revenues. On an average, hydrocarbon revenues accounted for c.80% of overall revenues in the past five year period (2009-2014). While part of the oil revenue is saved as sovereign wealth fund, most is channelled to the local economy in the form of wages for public sector employees, large scale subsidies (energy, electricity and water), capital transfers and generous grants for its citizens.
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
Though some measures was warranted in part to mitigate the effects of global financial crisis and alleviate the rising social pressures, the deteriorating fiscal situation amid the lower oil price environment warrants relook at ways to augment revenue streams and curb wasteful expenditures. The slump in oil prices, has renewed focus on containing current expenditures, prioritizing capital expenditures and introducing measures to rationalize subsidies.<br />
<br />
The Government of Kuwait must capitalize on the opportunity offered by low oil prices to contain expenditures, which are skewed towards current expenditures&nbsp; (c.90% of expenditures have been current in nature) rather than the productive capital investments, by introducing appropriate reforms in labour market, energy market and by focusing on removing subsidies in a phased manner. The price of petrol (KD 0.06/litre) in Kuwait is cheaper than water (KD 0.10/litre) and electricity prices have remained unchanged for nearly 50years. Electricity prices in Kuwait were last revised in 1966 and it is currently offered at less than 5% of the production cost. At the rate of KWf 2/kW against a production cost KWf 41.4/kW remains among the lowest globally. In this regard, introduction of taxes &ndash; direct (personal tax, business tax) as well as indirect (service tax, consumption tax), raising costs of government services in a gradual and phased manner could be considered. Although Kuwait maintains a high level of sovereign assets, dipping into it will only result in a short term fix and implementing a long term solution such as introduction of taxes seem more prudent. Acording to Marmore&rsquo;s Kuwait economic themes report, business taxation and subsidy rationalization should not be seen as mutually exclusive actions to ease the fiscal situation. If business taxation is being seen as a route towards furnishing the revenue side of the budgetary equation, then it would make for poor policy to divest it of any linkages with subsidies reform. It is, indeed, the case that subsidies&rsquo; reform can prove to be sensitive among several stakeholders; however, increasing the tax burden on the private sector in lieu of gains from subsidies reform can harm the long term prospects in terms of economic diversification. The measures, if done in tandem, could help avoid subsidy leakages, ensure continued infrastructural spending and help improve competitiveness of Kuwait economy. Job creation for nationals and the need to increase the role of private sector in the economy, is also widely stressed.</div>

&nbsp;
<div style="text-align: justify;">Kuwait, with a low fiscal breakeven oil price of USD 51.8/barrel in 2016, is expected to weather the environment of lower oil prices better than its GCC peers. This is also, in part, due to the presence of ample fiscal reserves and buffers which stands at 323% of GDP. Kuwait, with low debt and higher fiscal reserves, accumulated during periods of elevated oil prices, could resort to raising debt in the domestic market, international market or draw down on its buffers or a mixture of both. The actions of the government, in this regard, in the coming months will be keenly watched as it would have wider implications on the economy.</div>[:ar]<img alt="Kuwait_fig1.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kuwait-Economic-Themes-Fig1.jpg" style="width: 650px; height: 526px;" title="Kuwait_fig1.jpg" />Acording to Marmore&rsquo;s Kuwait economic themes report, Kuwait continues to be extremely reliant on oil for revenues.

Acording to Marmore&rsquo;s Kuwait economic themes report, business taxation and subsidy rationalization should not be seen as mutually exclusive actions to ease the fiscal situation. If business taxation is being seen as a route towards furnishing the revenue side of the budgetary equation, then it would make for poor policy to divest it of any linkages with subsidies reform. It is, indeed, the case that subsidies&rsquo; reform can prove to be sensitive among several stakeholders; however, increasing the tax burden on the private sector in lieu of gains from subsidies reform can harm the long term prospects in terms of economic diversification. The measures, if done in tandem, could help avoid subsidy leakages, ensure continued infrastructural spending and help improve competitiveness of Kuwait economy. Job creation for nationals and the need to increase the role of private sector in the economy, is also widely stressed.</div>

&nbsp;
<div style="text-align: justify;">Kuwait, with a low fiscal breakeven oil price of USD 51.8/barrel in 2016, is expected to weather the environment of lower oil prices better than its GCC peers. This is also, in part, due to the presence of ample fiscal reserves and buffers which stands at 323% of GDP. Kuwait, with low debt and higher fiscal reserves, accumulated during periods of elevated oil prices, could resort to raising debt in the domestic market, international market or draw down on its buffers or a mixture of both. The actions of the government, in this regard, in the coming months will be keenly watched as it would have wider implications on the economy.</div>[:]]]></Content>

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<img alt="Qatar_fig1.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Qatar-Economic-Themes-fig1.jpg" style="width: 652px; height: 413px;" title="Qatar_fig1.jpg" />
<div style="text-align: justify;"><br />
With the second lowest fiscal breakeven oil price (USD 57.8 per barrel) and the presence of ample fiscal reserves and buffer (172 per cent of GDP), Qatar is expected to withstand the current environment of low oil prices better than its regional peers. According to Marmore&rsquo;s Qatar Economic Themes report,the country plans to spend USD 200bn on infrastructure as part of its 2030 development plan and this&nbsp; has lured foreign contractors to what promised to be big profits, but project delays and problems with contracts and bureaucracy have left many in difficulties and their returns uncertain.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
A new budget, which includes cut in expenditures in anticipation of the country&rsquo;s first fiscal shortfall in 15years, was released on 16th December 2015. Expenditures are forecasted at USD 55.6bn next year, which is a 7.28 per cent decline from the last fiscal year, despite the increase in outlays on government salaries, wages and major projects &ndash; such as major transportation initiatives and preparations for the 2022 World Cup.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
A massive drop in revenues caused by lower oil and gas prices is forecast to leave a deficit of USD 12.8bn in next year&rsquo;s budget. To cover this financial shortfall, the country plans to borrow money rather than tap into the reserves held by the Qatar Investment Authority (USD 256bn), according to the Finance Ministry.<br />
<br />
Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), estimated to be worth USD 256bn in assets as on June 2015, by the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute (SWFI), had divested at least three stakes in recent months, the last of which was the October sale of USD 2.5bn shares in the UK-based BG Group. While the reasons for these divestments were not disclosed, it is believed to be linked to the state spending on mega-infrastructure works. More asset liquidations are likely to follow from the QIA&#39;s reported paper loss of USD 12bn on equity stakes in Glencore, Agricultural Bank of China and Volkswagen, according to the Financial Times.<br />

<br />
Qatar is one of the world&rsquo;s largest consumers of water and electricity per capita and its use is increasing as its population increases. In 2014, the amount of electricity generated in Qatar jumped 11.6 percent to 38,693 gigawatt hours (GWh) . Roughly that is the amount of energy that can power 3.4 million homes for a year. Qatar has taken its 1st step in reforming energy consumption in the country with tariff hikes in Kharamaa.<br />

Qatar has been pushing for the growth of SMEs as part of its Qatar National Vision plan 2030. SMEs have the capacity to provide jobs,&nbsp; encourage innovation and diversification in an economy, bolstering the private sector and fostering entrepreneurialism.Qatar Development Bank (QDB), guarantees up to 85 percent of commercial loans, limited to QR15 million ($4.1 million), for SME projects, under its Al Dhameen program.<br />

		<Title>[:en]UAE Top Economic and Investment Themes for 2016[:ar]الموضوعات الاقتصادية والاستثمارية الأهم لدولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة لعام 2016[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p><img alt="UAE_table1.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/UAE-Top-Economic-and-Investment-Themes-fig1.jpg" style="width: 656px; height: 660px;" title="UAE_table1.jpg" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">According to Marmore&rsquo;s UAE economic themes report, Hydrocarbon sector is expected to contribute positively to real growth in 2016 as the phased increase in oil production happens. UAE had earlier set a target to raise its production capacity by 30% in 2020. Non-hydrocarbon growth is expected to be moderate in 2016, amid the lower oil price environment, as government expenditures are reined in.<br />
<br />
<strong>Diversified & Competitive Economy</strong><br />
United Arab Emirates (UAE) has been the forerunner in implementing reforms to strengthen its business and economy among the GCC nations. Consequently, UAE has made significant progress in diversifying its economic structure. Share of hydrocarbon GDP to total GDP has fallen over the years. For UAE, being the least dependent nation on oil, IMF has estimated the revenue loss to be in the range of 5% to 20% compared to other GCC nations whose losses are estimated to be more than 20%. Notably, UAE is the only GCC nation to have diversified its exports to other sectors by more than 50% and therefore has lesser impact on its revenue.<br />
<br />
<strong>Creation of a Local Debt Market in UAE</strong><br />
UAE&rsquo;s sovereign debt commands an investment grade rating of Aa2 (Moody&rsquo;s), AA (Standard & Poor&rsquo;s) and AA (Fitch) with a stable outlook for the year 2016. Rating agencies cite the rating is underpinned by the presence of large scale fiscal buffers.<br />
<br />
<img alt="UAE_table2.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/UAE-Top-Economic-and-Investment-Themes-fig2.jpg" style="width: 602px; height: 358px;" title="UAE_table2.jpg" /><br />
<br />
While UAE has so far not issued any debt instruments, it might do so in the coming year. Public debt law, which is required for issuance of federal sovereign bonds has been stuck in the government consultative process for the past five years. According to Marmore&rsquo;s UAE economic themes report, raising debt in the domestic market, if done in a measured way, could help in the establishment of an active and liquid debt market.<br />
<br />
<strong>Dubai Real Estate </strong><br />
Real estate sales were robust in the first half of 2014, supported by successful bid for Expo 2020, while the rentals in Dubai surged by more than three times during the 2013-14 period. With the rapidly increasing rental and sale value for the residential sector in UAE, it was anticipated that the sector was overheating, particularly in Dubai. Howeever, the lower consumer confidence following lower oil prices and a stronger U.S dollar post the recent interest rate hike by the U.S Fed, could further affect foreign investments into UAE, especially in the real estate sector. With sales in the real estate sector dwindling and prices declining, it is imperative other engines of growth are established.<br />
<br />
<strong>Subsidy Rationalization</strong><br />
Assessing the impact of oil on revenues and GDP and comparing it with its peers, we can uphold that low oil prices will have lesser impact on UAE than other GCC nations. UAE&rsquo;s government has introduced major fiscal reforms in order to cope with the low oil price and strengthen their economy to be more resilient in the coming years. The petrol prices in UAE post the subsidy cut are closer to average world prices. UAE however retains the diesel prices low in order to aid its transport and logistics industry which is currently traversing difficult waters.<br />
<br />
<strong>Leader in SME Space in GCC</strong><br />
UAE has around 300,000 Small and Medium Enetrprises (SMEs), which represent 92 per cent of all companies and provide 86 per cent of jobs in the UAE market. UAE has plans as part of its Vision 2021 to increase SMEs contribution to non-oil GDP by 70 per cent. Despite various efforts by the government to boost their SME sector, funding remains a hurdle for most SMEs. Loans to SMEs account for only 4% of total outstanding loans. This deprivies SMEs of credit and they are most dependent on private financicers where the capital costs are high. Addressing the issues and ensuring availability of financing for SMEs could prove to be a game changer.</p>[:ar]<p><img alt="UAE_table1.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/UAE-Top-Economic-and-Investment-Themes-fig1.jpg" style="width: 656px; height: 660px;" title="UAE_table1.jpg" /></p>

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<img alt="KSA_Table1.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KSA-Economic-Themes-fig1.jpg" style="width: 694px; height: 382px;" title="KSA_Table1.jpg" />
<div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Energy Prices Reform</strong><br />
The government of KSA over the past few decades used perks such as lower energy prices, food & water subsidies and absence of taxes for individuals and domestic corporations to distribute the oil wealth to its citizens. The subsidized energy prices translate into significant costs for the government, estimated at USD 107bn or 13.2% of the gross domestic product in 2015. However, the low oil price environment calls for prudent assessment and reforms in these subsidies to achieve sustainability of government finances on a long-term basis. The low energy cost has also resulted in substantial increase in per capita energy consumption in KSA. According to Marmore&rsquo;s KSA economic themes report, GCC countries consumed 9.2 tonnes of oil equivalent (TOEs) per capita in 2014, as against the world average of 4 TOEs per capita. On December 29, 2015, KSA increased the price of higher-grade unleaded petrol to USD 0.24 (SAR 0.90) per liter from USD 0.16 (SAR 0.60), a hike of 50%. Lower-grade petrol has been hiked to USD 0.20 (SAR 0.75) from USD 0.12 (SAR 0.45) per liter. The direct impact higher energy prices on inflation is expected to be low as the weightage of energy products in the consumer price index (CPI) is relatively small for KSA. The reform is expected to result in negative shocks to productive sector. However, in in the long-term, energy price reforms are expected to generate income gains, rational consumption and improved efficiency contributing to the economic growth.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Local Debt Market Development</strong><br />
For the first time since 2007, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia raised funds through bond issuance. KSA is expected to continue raising funds from bonds markets to plug the fiscal shortfall. Raising debt in the domestic market, if done in a measured way, could help in the establishment of an active and liquid debt market. Moreover, regular issuances of sovereign bonds could help deepen the Saudi debt market which could potentially flag off strong corporate issuances. The creation of a robust corporate debt market will shift the corporate risks into the capital markets and away from the banking system. This will create a more stable and well balanced financial system. Additionally, the availablilty of debt at the cheaper rate relative to the opportunity costs for Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) make debt a more viable option.<br />
<br />
<strong>KSA Currency Peg</strong><br />
The emerging markets have historically witnessed a push in their economic output after the devaluation of their currencies. Most of the world&rsquo;s biggest oil and commodity exporter&rsquo;s currencies have lost value during 2015. However, Saudi Arabia has continued to maintain its peg to USD and due to which it is spending more FX reserves during a low oil revenues regime resulting in lower inflow of FX. The currency depreciation benefits the country&rsquo;s oil producers, since they pay for oil production in local currency, but receive revenues in dollars. If KSA continues to hold its peg, its revenue from oil would continue to decline, unless the oil prices increase. The longer oil languishes, the more pressure builds on Saudi Arabia to abandon its currency peg. However, the rate of the reserves&#39; decline is likely to slow as the fiscal deficit would shrink to 16% of the gross domestic product in 2016 and the current account balance is set to return to a surplus from 2.4% deficit in 2015. All these factors clearly imply the unlikelihood of Saudi Arabia abandoning its currency peg to the USD.<br />
<br />
<strong>Labor Law Reforms</strong><br />
KSA&rsquo;s dependence on foreign labor helped KSA overcome the shortage of local labor. However, it has created distortions in the KSA labor market and resulted in increased dependence on nationals for public sector employment. These distortions constraint the ability to employ fast growing educated national workforce in the private sector. As the private sector continues to employ expatriates it has resulted in high unemployment rates for nationals, particularly among youth. Realizing these challenges, authorities in the KSA have adopted a reform strategy with the objective of increasing employment of Saudis in the private sector. However, measures are also required to improve the attractiveness of wages in private sector at par with public sector. In order to limit any potential fiscal, inflationary, wages and macroeconomic disruptions, it would be ideal to gradually substitute expatriate with the national workforce.<br />
<br />
<strong>Foreign Investment Reforms</strong><br />
KSA was ranked as the third largest FDI recipient in Western Asia, after Turkey and the United Arab Emirates during 2014. However, it has experienced a steady decline in foreign direct investment since 2011 and the trend is expected to continue in the near future. In-order to turn around this downward trend and to diversify the hydrocarbon-dependent economy to reduce the shocks of oil slumps and create jobs for nationals, the Government has embarked on several reforms. Opening of Tadawul to foreign investors and permitting 100% FDI in retail sector are some of the reforms introduced to attract foreign investments in KSA. KSA&rsquo;s decision to open its retail market to foreign investors is set to attract USD 2.66bn of foreign investments in the next year.</div>[:ar]<img alt="KSA_Table1.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KSA-Economic-Themes-fig1.jpg" style="width: 694px; height: 382px;" title="KSA_Table1.jpg" />

<div style="text-align: justify;">From the above table, it is evident that only Kuwait and Qatar are estimated to enjoy a surplus in 2015. Plotting the GCC surplus/deficit from 2004 through 2015 against the average dollar price of crude Brent shows the deep correlation.</div>
<br />
<img alt="Figure1.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Why-Research-Matters-for-the-Economy-fig2.jpg" style="width: 685px; height: 520px;" title="Figure1.jpg" />
<div style="text-align: justify;">Thus, diversifying the economy is an imperative for the GCC, on building a competitive knowledge economy and promoting innovation, research, and development (R&D). However, for building a knowledge economy, reliable access to data and information is required, which should be underpinned by robust research or analytics.<br />
<br />
The 2014 Marmore research publication, called &lsquo;Research in GCC: The Knowledge Gap&rsquo;, found that in the GCC, often, inadequate availability of statistics from national authorities, lack of data from industrial associations and limited disclosures by public companies can limit the degree of research and by extension its effectiveness. Moreover, data or information often comes with significant time lags. Knowledge economy experts point out the importance of the triple helix model of innovation, i.e., government-industry-university relationships and synergies, in terms of nurturing sustainable economic development. University research, which is often considered the cradle of innovation, is found lacking in the GCC region as evidenced by the number of scientific papers published in 2014.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">In the GCC, R&D spending, largely, has lagged global peers. Technology is increasingly going to be a critical enabler of economic change and competitive advantage. However, in order to understand what a country can do best, R&D spending has to be smart, i.e., it has to be backed up by research that is reliable in identifying suitable industry clusters and innovation ecosystems.

<div style="text-align: justify;">From the above table, it is evident that only Kuwait and Qatar are estimated to enjoy a surplus in 2015. Plotting the GCC surplus/deficit from 2004 through 2015 against the average dollar price of crude Brent shows the deep correlation.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Thus, diversifying the economy is an imperative for the GCC, on building a competitive knowledge economy and promoting innovation, research, and development (R&D). However, for building a knowledge economy, reliable access to data and information is required, which should be underpinned by robust research or analytics.<br />
<br />
The 2014 Marmore research publication, called &lsquo;Research in GCC: The Knowledge Gap&rsquo;, found that in the GCC, often, inadequate availability of statistics from national authorities, lack of data from industrial associations and limited disclosures by public companies can limit the degree of research and by extension its effectiveness. Moreover, data or information often comes with significant time lags. Knowledge economy experts point out the importance of the triple helix model of innovation, i.e., government-industry-university relationships and synergies, in terms of nurturing sustainable economic development. University research, which is often considered the cradle of innovation, is found lacking in the GCC region as evidenced by the number of scientific papers published in 2014.</div>

		<Title>[:en]The Paris Climate Agreement and Implications for the GCC[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">The Paris climate change deal will only come into force after it is placed for signatures of approval (from 22 April 2016 to 21 April 2017) by States and regional economic integration organizations that are Parties to the Convention (The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change). It is notable that the agreement can only come into force if it has received ratification by 55 countries that represent at least 55% of global emissions. For France that hosted the climate change conference, the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties (COP21) ranked as the largest international diplomatic conference ever organized by the country.<br />
<br />
The Paris agreement establishes a new international context for countries&rsquo; use of fossil fuels, including limiting worldwide temperature rise to well below the two degrees Celsius mark and undertaking efforts to constrain the rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius over the long term (The Scottish Government). The climate change agreement is a reflection of a collective thought, particularly emanating from the advanced nations, that is trying to move towards a post-hydrocarbon energy era. What does this mean for the GCC, whose predominant source of income is hydrocarbons? The following graphic illustrates the contribution of nonhydrocarbon revenue as a percentage of total revenue.<br />
&nbsp;</div>

<div>
<div id="ftn2"><img alt="Figure1.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Paris-climate-fig1.jpg" style="width: 661px; height: 434px;" title="Figure1.jpg" /></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">In November 2015, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) released estimates that the GCC&rsquo;s export revenues would be nearly $275 billion lower in 2015, in comparison with the preceding year, due to the oil price decline since mid-2014. The shortfall in hydrocarbon revenues has caused concerns about fiscal deficits across the GCC. Analysts predict that GCC countries would raise at least $15 billion in the international bond markets in 2016, an amount that would range higher than all GCC sovereign dollar debt issuance from 2013 through 2015 (Zawya). The following graphic illustrates the year on year change in hydrocarbon revenue (growth or shrinkage) from 2012 through 2016(f).<br />
<br />
<img alt="Table1.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Paris-climate-fig2.jpg" style="width: 633px; height: 193px;" title="Table1.jpg" /></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">There is also a concerted push towards renewable energies evident in the policies of various countries around the world. Global investment in renewable energy rose by 17% to touch $270 billion in 2014. Also, the green bonds market, which barely had a presence even until a decade ago, is now worth $66 billion. The market was worth just $2 billion in 2011, implying a CAGR of about 140% from 2011 through 2015. The GCC itself is participating proactively in developing a renewable energy future. However, the concern is that the renewable energies paradigm may emerge so quickly that the needed economic diversification efforts may not have sufficient time to bear fruit.<br />
&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Table2.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Paris-climate-fig3.jpg" style="width: 717px; height: 328px;" title="Table2.jpg" /><br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the supply side of the oil equation is getting larger as well. On December 19, 2015, news emerged that the U.S. lifted a 40-year-old ban on export of American oil. Moreover, Iran, which anticipates removal of sanctions soon, has indicated that it would boost output by 500,000 barrels per day in a post-sanctions environment, which it expects sometime in early 2016. Thus, the oil glut appears to be getting wider by the day.<br />
<br />
<img alt="Figure2.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Paris-climate-fig4.jpg" style="width: 690px; height: 454px;" title="Figure2.jpg" /><br />
<br />
In conclusion, it can be said that if the GCC does not economically diversify and create new revenue sources, then the massive fiscal reserves too will come under immense stress over the long term. The Paris climate deal is one more reminder and catalyst for the urgent need for economic diversification in the GCC.</div>

		<Title>[:en]GCC liquidity squeeze could spur reforms: MR Raghu – Low oil prices could result in deficit of 7.9% of GDP in 2015[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">Raghu pointed out that the recent fall in oil prices by over 61 percent since June, 2014 due to a host of factors such as shale oil revolution in US, OPEC decision to retain their output levels amid signs of tenuous demand growth had spilled over into the GCC financial system through banking channels, leading to spurts in overnight lending rate.<br />
<br />
Raghu added that GCC countries continue to be heavily reliant on hydrocarbon revenues, despite their diversification efforts. IMF expects oil export revenues for GCC countries to decline by $250 bn in 2015 from 2014 levels. With the current oil price being lower than the breakeven oil prices, fiscal surplus of GCC countries which stood at 4.6 percent of GDP in 2014 is expected to turn into deficit to the tune of 7.9 percent of GDP in 2015. Though the GCC governments had largely retained their budgetary spending in 2015, thus sustaining economic growth in the medium term, fiscal reforms are imperative.<br />
<br />
He noted that with the fiscal situation amid the low oil price environment drastically changed the GCC governments may have to reassess their spending patterns. However, the low debt levels of the GCC countries, which stand at 9 percent of GDP as against 117 percent of GDP for G7 nations coupled with higher sovereign ratings for most GCC countries, lend comfort in the short-term.<br />
<br />
With most international organizations such as IMF, World Bank and leading investment banks (JP Morgan & Goldman Sachs) expecting the lower oil price environment to persist, GCC governments have been drawing multiple strategies to plug the deficit, including liquidating their stakes held through Sovereign Wealth Funds. Saudi Arabia has already withdrawn over $70 bn of its reserves in the past year. Additionally, governments across the GCC region have cut-back on non-priority spending and are working on tackling the increasing subsidy problem.<br />
<br />
Raghu added that the impact of lower oil revenues has visibly impacted the deposit mobilization process in GCC banks, as government deposits account for sizeable portion. Fall in deposits growth coupled with governments drawing down on their savings has led to short-term pressures on the money market. Though the banks are well capitalized, they may not be able to act as the sole source of funding avenue for the governments.<br />
<br />
Equity markets have fallen over the last year in line with the drop in crude oil prices. With GCC corporate earnings expected to be muted in the near term, and declining bank lending to invest in the equity markets, stocks in the GCC may face continued pressure. Indeed, the valuation of GCC markets as measured by P/E multiple has on an average declined by 25 percent, since Q2, 2014. International bond issues from the GCC countries (corporate and sovereign) have dropped 33 percent from a year earlier to $ 22 billion in the first nine months of 2015 which is the lowest 9-month total since 2008.<br />
<br />
Additional funding routes such as local and international debt markets could be tapped. KSA for the first time in last eight years raised debt to the tune of $27 bn in local debt market. Revenue augmentation measures such as introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) across GCC is being widely discussed. On the other hand, IMF has been advocating introduction of taxes in a phased manner.<br />
<br />
While the record low interest rates, higher sovereign ratings, low debt levels and higher opportunity cost for Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) argue for the case to raise debt to plug the deficit rather than liquidating SWF assets, the actions of GCC government and its impact on the financial system at large, will be closely watched in the coming months, opined Raghu. Continued pressure on liquidity will accelerate long awaited reforms in the GCC region which augurs well for the long-tem</div>

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CORPORATE GOVERNANCE</strong><br />
<em>By M R Raghu</em><br />
&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Companies that have effective corporate governance mechanisms can instill a sense of accountability and transparency in organizational leaders. In an age of dynamic technological developments that are empowering various stakeholders to monitor and question organizational actions, a functioning corporate governance setup will help in building deeper public trust. There are several factors, both international and regional, that are pushing companies in the GCC toward more proactive corporate governance practices.</strong></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<img alt="Table1_GCC_Corp_goverence.png" height="178" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Corporate-governance-in-the-GCC-fig1.jpg" title="Table1_GCC_Corp_goverence.png" width="642" /><br />
There is now intensified international convergence of prudential and regulatory codes and standards on matters such as anti- money laundering and counterterrorist financing. In a regional context, the role of the stock exchanges and capital markets are growing in the GCC, which traditionally has had a large number of privately held and family-owned enterprises. There is little doubt there is still some way to go before all of the GCC develops highly robust corporate governance codes and practices.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
A 2006 report published by the Institute of International Finance and Hawkamah, the Institute for Corporate Governance noted that: &ldquo;[I]n general, the economic and business environments within the Gulf Cooperation Council [&hellip;] countries have not been conducive to the development of effective corporate governance practices. With the exception of Oman and to a lesser extent Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, the current corporate governance frameworks of GCC countries do not meet the threshold sought by international investors.&rdquo; In the GCC, the first wave of corporate governance practices began with the corporate governance codes released by Oman in 2002. The following table lists the years that GCC countries released their corporate governance codes, along with the issuing entity.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Corporate governance in the GCC has come under sharper focus with the recent Mobily incident. Mobily, the Saudi subsidiary of the UAE-based telecom major, Etihad Etisalat, admitted in November 2014 that it would have to restate 18 months&rsquo; worth of corporate earnings due to alleged accounting irregularities. The development has caused Mobily&rsquo;s shares, which was one of the strongest telecom stocks, to lose about 60% in value from November 2014 through October 2015, with trading in the shares suspended twice in 2015 (as of October 2015) by the Kingdom&rsquo;s market regulator.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Moreover, statistics reveal that over 70% of business enterprises in the GCC are either family-owned or controlled, which indicates that family businesses have to embrace the concept of corporate governance for it to holistically succeed in the region. Corporate governance can very often get associated with listed companies, corporate irregularities, and related compliance and controls. Increasingly, it is important to consider corporate governance as an enabler of sustainability of GCC companies, including family-owned ones.<br />
<br />
GCC countries will need time to evolve their corporate governance structures, in line with best practices from around the world. There is awareness of the need for patience to allow corporate governance systems to grow into maturity. For instance, Kuwait&rsquo;s corporate governance codes, issued in 2013, called for the separation of the positions of chairman and chief executive, the prompt disclosure of corporate information to the market, and the establishment of internal controls and risk management.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The new codes framed by the authorities have increased the number of audit requirements that add to the increasing cost of compliance to companies. However, keeping in mind the practical constraints that may hinder some of the Kuwaiti companies from applying the governance rules, Kuwait&rsquo;s market regulator extended the implementation deadline by 1.5 years to the end of 2016.<br />
<br />
According to a Gulf Family Business Council and McKinsey & Company study (released in October 2015) that surveyed the largest GCC family-owned businesses that collectively generate US$100 billion in yearly revenues, family-owned businesses in the region have made considerable progress in establishing corporate governance structures, but are lacking when it comes to systematic implementation. In an era of global competition, deficient corporate governance implementation can pose challenges to enterprise sustainability for a number of GCC companies. Though many family-owned GCC businesses are now competing with international players, they are still characterized by centralized decision-making that diminishes the capacity for strategic agility and operational nimbleness.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
There are two principal forms of articulating corporate governance codes: The &lsquo;principles-based&rsquo; approach and the &lsquo;rules-based&rsquo; approach. In the GCC, corporate governance codes can tend to be rather rules-based, wherein specific instructions are provided and a set of rules are explained for extracting compliance. In some jurisdictions, such as in the UK, the Cadbury Commission of the London Stock Exchange released their Combined Code of Governance Principles and Best Practices which are principles- based. Even in Hong Kong the good governance practices were published as a &lsquo;Code of Best Practices&rsquo;. The codes&rsquo; intention is not to provide rules to be rigidly adhered to, but rather to serve as aspirational guidelines.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The principles-based approach emphasizes more on the essence of the guidance and attempts to foster responsibility and the exercise of professional judgment. This approach also eliminates the mechanistic mindset of &lsquo;box-ticking&rsquo; to comply with legislation and the use of potential loopholes to avoid compliance.<br />
<br />
The principles-based approach is considered relatively robust and flexible. Meanwhile, the rules based approach is considered easier to comply with as the requirements are clearly articulated and leave little room for misunderstanding or fluid interpretations. For regulators, the rules-based approach is deemed to be easier to enforce. The principles and guidelines-based approach is favored by most jurisdictions around the globe for encouraging better governance. This could be due to the thought that the spirit of regulation should be given more importance and that trust should be extended to corporations to endorse such implicit principles.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In 2014, Fitch Ratings cautioned that though corporate governance practices are consistently improving in the GCC, privately-owned companies are being impeded due to a lack of effective independent boards, limited transparency and weak disclosure practices. For GCC companies with international ambitions, lagging corporate governance standards can discourage international investors and partners when faced with tightly controlled company ownership structures that practice limited transparency. GCC countries will also have to look at inculcating more diversity in the board, by bringing in independent directors with subject matter expertise. This will aid the process of interdisciplinary thinking that is vital for the success of modern organizations. For example, the following table provides ideas as to how board structures can be reimagined in the GCC (table developed in the context of Kuwait).<br />
<br />
<img alt="Table2_GCC_Corp_goverence.png" height="576" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Corporate-governance-in-the-GCC-fig2.jpg" title="Table2_GCC_Corp_goverence.png" width="640" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Large companies in the GCC are now recognizing the need to work with professional bodies to access best practices and shared learning. For example, in March 2015, Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s mining and metals major, Ma&rsquo;aden, signed an agreement with the GCC Board Directors Institute, which would allow Ma&rsquo;aden employees to access the latest training, best practices and networking opportunities. GCC countries are also looking to enhance board diversity in terms of gender. In 2012, the UAE cabinet enacted a regulation making it mandatory for the country&rsquo;s corporations and federal agencies to include women in their boards. Even as the policies, regulations and structures fall into place, a lot would depend on practicing the spirit of corporate governance, beyond just mere compliance with the rules.<br />

2015 has seen oil prices drop to a new low amid a glut of supply in the region. But how will this affect the GCC and MENA economies? Will there be an end to the current situation? And will the prices stabilise before the end of the year or do they have further to drop?
<strong>Peter Duke:</strong> Good morning welcome to the Fund Forum Middle East. My name is Peter Duke from Fidelity Worldwide Investment. I am delighted to be joined today by Mr. MR Raghu, Head of Research, at Markaz. Raghu Welcome!
<strong>Raghu:</strong> Thank you
<strong>Peter Duke:</strong> Your special subject today is oil so of course we kickoff with the basic question around demand and supply and how you see those dynamics in your market at the moment
<strong>Raghu:</strong> Sure! You know at a very broad level, any commodity is always impacted by demand and supply. Price is always a function of demand and supply and this works very well for oil as well. In the past when we have demand slackening, the supply gets adjusted and therefore the prices defended. Now that model has broken down and we have a double whammy now if I may call it. So we have a weak demand and we have an oversupply , so this is killing the price, obviously. Now the question to ask is “why is supply not getting adjusted to a weak demand to defend the price?” ok that’s where I feel the politics comes in to play and that’s why I said there is a shift in the way we have to think about the oil market in the current context of the simple “demand – supply –price” equation.
<strong>Peter Duke:</strong> Raghu you said that argument about politics must be the role of Saudi Arabia is key here. How do see that and how do you judge that policies on internationally working, do you think that it will stabilize away.
<strong>Raghu:</strong> Yes it was very surprising the way I understand how Saudi has acted at this time around, because traditionally OPEC which is “Saudi Arabia” always had this defend price strategy in place. But they have observed that unconventional oil has come to the market in a big way and the traditional price driven response may actually backfire on them after some time. So they have decided to play the gamble and the gamble is,  “don’t defend the price but defend your market share” which means keep producing rather produce more you know to get more market share and they know the consequence. The consequence will be a lower price and we all see that today. But the thing is there is an inflexion point to this gamble.They want to play this till they get the high cost producers out of the scene and then go back and play their original equation of defending the price. Now, the thing is “who is going to blink first?”, that is the question now. So the way we understand unconventional producers,  it’s a very hazy picture because there is a technology angle to it, there is a price angle to it and the player profile is different, the conventional oil is controlled by national oil companies for example, backed by huge sovereigns, unconventional oil is controlled by small players who are mostly in the just bond market,  such a completely different dynamics. So we don’t know the jury is still not out and we hope the Saudi gamble pays off and the oil market comes back to at least $70-80 as they wanted to be in the medium term. But right now we are in the scene, so we don’t know the climax.
<strong>Peter Duke:</strong> Well that might be the answer. But have you been surprised by the resilience of Shale produces in the US
<strong>Raghu:</strong> Absolutely, not only the resilience but the continuous downward estimate of the cost of production, because I remember Goldman Sachs were predicting the cost of unconventional oil about $80 to start with about two years back. But today they are talking about $60 and they are estimating it to go down. So as the cost of production goes down then you know both sides may not blink for a long time. So that is big event to watch. So it’s not happening, you defend your market share and people just go out of the system, they are just not going out of the system actually.
<strong>Peter Duke:</strong> We have new people coming in to the system like Iran what’s your view
<strong>Raghu: </strong>Iran is not a big thing as people make it out to be. But definitely in about three four years they will even contribute to the oversupply situation. But not only Iran, we have to talk about Iraq, we have to talk about Libya all hotspots where we thought supply could be constrained, are never constrained. So they are actually adding to the glut of the supply and then demand side is getting bad and therefore we have a double whammy effect on the price.
<strong>Peter Duke:</strong> if you see this oil crises at these level may be increasing in the medium term. What is the impact in terms of the GCC economies, the <strong>stresses</strong> that may come out?
<strong>Raghu:</strong> I feel that the impact is more negative for MENA economies rather GCC Economies. Why because GCC Economies are sitting on huge reserves and they have the fire power to withstand this low oil price environment for a considerable period of time. All this tension about Saudi’s reserves dwindling very fast, it’s over blown in my view. Saudi’s definitely have amassed huge reserves that can stand them today in good stead compared to where they were in 1998 for example when oil prices were very low. But it will hurt MENA economies much more than GCC economies obviously because the breakeven oil price for MENA economies are much higher compared to GCC economies. For example Iran requires an oil price of $135, Saudi Arabia requires oil price of $100, Kuwait requires an oil price of $50. So the comfort zone is definitely much better in the GCC compared to MENA economies. So it’s the MENA economies that will start putting pressure to the extent they are in OPEC cartel to really stop this defending market share game and at least give us some price that we can breathe.
<strong>Peter Duke:</strong> One final question that I wanted to put on the spot in terms of oil prices at the end of this year what you think is the reasonable number
<strong>Raghu:</strong> That’s an easy question to answer because we are already close to end of the year, so I am fine to take a call on that! You know oil prices are now range bound between a band of $40 to $60 and I think that’s going to be there for some time. The $100 oil price era is simply gone. But we are not definitely in to the $20 oil scare as well. So $40 to $60 is a world comfort price but whether that is the “Comfort price” for GCC I don’t know.
<strong>Peter Duke: </strong>Raghu thank you very much for your insights. You heard this for Fund Forum Middle East. Thank you.
<strong>Raghu:</strong> Thank you, it’s a pleasure talking to you

		<Title>[:en]Weak Oil and Strong Dollar - A puzzling relationship[:ar]العلاقة بين ضعف النفط وقوة الدولار - علاقة محيرة[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<h1>Introduction</h1>
The relationship between oil price and dollar value is intriguing not only to the US and the oil-exporters, but to researchers and governments all over the world. Most commodities, including oil tend to be negatively correlated with the US dollar as most commodities are traded in dollar. The magnitude of the impact of dollar on oil and vice versa and its short term and long term impact on the economy provide interesting insights about the widely studied relationship between the most widely used currency and most widely used and traded commodity in the world.<br />
<br />
Research literature has mostly found the causal relationship to be triggered by the changes in oil price on the US dollar. Few studies also indicate that a depreciating dollar may have positive impact on oil price.<br />
<br />
As per an empirical study conducted by the Federal bank of New York, increasing oil prices lead to depreciating dollar both in the short and long run. Higher oil prices generate better revenue for the oil producing countries. Most of these countries were found recycling the petrodollars by investing back in the US, which led to the appreciation of US Dollar. The major oil exporting economies in the past 2 decades started to invest in instruments denominated in currencies other than dollar investments to protect them from shocks in the US economy and the risks of the US Dollar. The change in savings pattern of the oil exporting countries further added to the pressure on dollar.<br />
<br />
Oil price has impacted the value of dollar differently in various instances in the past. The major oil shocks in the past and its impact on dollar provide interesting ideas about the puzzling relationship between the oil price and dollar value.<br />
&nbsp;

<br />
<strong>October War</strong><strong> (1973):</strong><br />
The October war caused the oil price to increase from USD 3/barrel to USD 12/barrel during 1973 &ndash; 1974. Increasing oil prices and low growth caused stagflation in most western economies during the same period. The US dollar initially depreciated in 1973 and rose steadily in the second half of 1973 and 1974 due to increasing demand for USD. During this oil crisis, oil price and US dollar were positively correlated.<br />
<br />
<strong>Iranian Crisis (1979): </strong><br />
The Iranian crisis caused a massive impact on the oil exports as the production in both the countries came to a grinding halt. The oil price jumped to USD 35/barrel in 1980 from USD 15/barrel in 1978. Dollar appreciated by a low margin during the period indicating a moderately positive correlation between the oil price and dollar.<br />
<br />
<strong>Gulf war (1990):</strong><br />
Though the gulf war lasted for shorter duration compared to the earlier crisis, the oil price climbed up by almost 166% to USD 40/barrel. During the gulf war, one of the largest producers of oil in the region, Kuwait, faced invasion due to which oil production was affected. US dollar depreciated during the gulf war when the oil price was increasing. Unlike the past, dollar was negatively correlated with the oil price in 1990.<br />
<br />
<strong>2007, Global financial crisis and thereafter:</strong><br />
<strong>Figure 2: Prices of Brent Crude and USD Currency Index, 2007-2015</strong><br />
<img alt="Fig2-Prices-of-Brent-Crude.jpg" class="researchDemand" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Weak-Oil-and-Strong-Dollar-fig2.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 286px;" title="Fig2-Prices-of-Brent-Crude.jpg" /><br />

<br />
The oil price spiked in 2007 and 2008 reaching its peak at USD 147/barrel in 2008 during which the US dollar depreciated. The financial crisis in 2008-2009 slowed down the industrial activity in many countries leading to declined demand for oil. Oil price declined sharply and US Dollar reverted by appreciating. The position reversed from 2011 till H1 2014, when the oil price increased steadily mainly due to the demand from the emerging markets and US dollar depreciated. The oil prices declined after August 2014 due to shale exploration and US dollar appreciated during the same period. Analysis of oil price and USD between 2007 and 2015 indicated a strong negative correlation between the two. The correlation coefficient between oil and US Dollar during 2007 and 2015 was -0.622.<br />
<br />
Statistical analysis done by many researchers in US and oil importing countries indicates that dollar depreciation, on the other hand has caused increase in oil prices within a week. The impact of declining dollar can be evidenced in the oil price in the long run as well. Oil is widely traded and most of the importers pay in dollars for their imports. Dollar depreciation makes oil less expensive for its consumers causing a sudden spike in the demand. The increased demand for oil worldwide leads to higher oil prices. Oil price increased by almost 2.5 times during 2003-2007 as the US dollar was depreciating against major currencies like Yen and Euro. During 2006-2008, oil price increased by 46% in dollar terms and only by 17% in Euro terms.
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
The relationship between increasing oil price and depreciating dollar and vice versa has been evident from empirical evidences as well as past events such as gulf war and global financial crisis. The dollar valuation is dependent on other factors apart from the price of oil. Duration of the higher oil prices, the fundamentals in the global and US economy are other factors affect the dollar. In case of a temporary rise in oil prices, the impact on US dollar is expected to be low. For longer higher oil price regime, the economic situation needs to be taken into consideration before determining the correlation. If robust fundamentals prevail in the US and the emerging markets, then US dollar may appreciate and can be positively correlated with oil price. In case of weak fundamentals, the anticipation of recession or the actual onset of the recession will lead to depreciating dollar resulting in negative correlation as evident after 1990.<br />
<br />
Trends between the oil and USD correlation have changed in the past and will continue to change in the future. The recent fall in oil prices has not lead to an equivalent increase in value of dollar, though it has appreciated during the same period. Todd Wood, trader in emerging markets, explains that the relationship between oil prices and dollar value has weakened over the past as many countries like China, Russia and countries in the European Union are trying to de-dollarize their trade. This would eventually weaken the inverse relationship between oil price and dollar and vice versa. The relationship between oil and dollar has been puzzling researchers, economists, traders and policy makers and is expected to remain puzzled in the future.&nbsp;<br />

		<Title><![CDATA[[:en]Implications of the Chinese Crisis for GCC Economies & Markets[:ar]تداعيات الأزمة الصينية على اقتصادات وأسواق دول مجلس التعاون الخليجي[:]]]></Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]According to a report published by Marmore (<a title="Is China Stalling?" href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/is-china-stalling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Is China Stalling?</a>), the ensuing volatility in global markets was exacerbated by fears of rapid economic slowdown in China - the largest economy in the world (PPP terms), which stoked fears of impending global recession and led to a massive sell-off.

China, which now accounts for almost 15% of global economic growth, was perceived as an important global growth driver. Economists opined Chinese growth to lend support to world economy. Chinese influence on world economy steadily rose in the past two decades. Through its various trade links it has firmly established as a country with significant systemic influence on the world economy.

However, the recent episode of uncertainty over the economic trajectory of China due to lack of relevant indicators - to gauge the state of economy in a timely manner, has fuelled wide spread speculation regarding its health. Given the larger role it plays in the global scheme of things, the impact was felt on oil markets and the GCC equity markets (see above figure).

<strong>Chinese Economy in Transition</strong>
Since the global financial crisis, China had been reliant on cheaper credit fuelled investments and exports-led model of growth. However, this led to rapid rise in debt levels and created vulnerabilities in fiscal (government debt-to-GDP), real estate (excess housing supply), financial (shadow banking) and corporate (high credit-to-GDP) sectors leading to increasing pressure on financial system and declining investment efficiency.

Credit-to-GDP ratio remains high in China as measured by Bank of International Settlements (BIS) credit gap measure. The increase was fuelled by corporate sector, particularly in real estate and State Owned Enterprises (SOEs).

Implicit guarantees extended to SOEs through perceived state backing had led them to benefit from preferential access to credit. Such preferential financing of SOEs often crowd out private sector lending. Further, support lent to inefficient and unviable SOE drags investment efficiency of the system.

In China, residential real estate investment accounts for more than two-thirds of total real estate investment. High level of investment in real estate sector had led to build up of excessive inventories and an oversupply situation, which are often dubbed as ‘Ghost Cities/Towns’ due to lack of inhabitants. Such a situation is widely prevalent in tier-3 and tier-4 cities which account for over 50% of real estate investments. It is estimated that they currently have unsold supply of around three years of sales.

In order to address them and establish growth on a more sustainable basis, Chinese authorities have been engineering a managed slowdown. The economic growth is now oriented towards domestic consumption with a primary focus on services sector rather than the traditional industrial or manufacturing sectors.

Much faith was placed on the governmental authorities to effectively engineer the daunting economic transition. As of 2014, activity in tertiary sector such as services contributed approx. 48% of GDP, much higher than the c.43% share of secondary sector such as manufacturing and construction signifying steady progress in the rebalancing act.

<strong>Impact on GCC Economies</strong>
Perceived slowdown of China could stoke fears of recession. It has been 7 years since the outbreak of global financial crisis and the policy makers, who have relied on monetary tools, have no options to fall back on in the event of another economic crisis.

In such an environment of economic uncertainty and prevailing lower oil price environment, GCC governments could reassess their expenditure programs. Subsidies could be curtailed and taxes could be proposed to garner additional revenue.

As the GCC currencies are pegged to dollar, yuan devaluation could make investments into GCC a bit expensive. This could have an effect on tourism as well. Chinese were among the top spenders in Dubai Shopping Festival.

China is the second largest importer globally after the U.S. To gauge the direct impact on GCC countries, we analysed the trade linkages with GCC countries.

</div>[:ar]According to a report published by Marmore (<a title="Is China Stalling?" href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/is-china-stalling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Is China Stalling?</a>), the ensuing volatility in global markets was exacerbated by fears of rapid economic slowdown in China - the largest economy in the world (PPP terms), which stoked fears of impending global recession and led to a massive sell-off.

China, which now accounts for almost 15% of global economic growth, was perceived as an important global growth driver. Economists opined Chinese growth to lend support to world economy. Chinese influence on world economy steadily rose in the past two decades. Through its various trade links it has firmly established as a country with significant systemic influence on the world economy.

However, the recent episode of uncertainty over the economic trajectory of China due to lack of relevant indicators - to gauge the state of economy in a timely manner, has fuelled wide spread speculation regarding its health. Given the larger role it plays in the global scheme of things, the impact was felt on oil markets and the GCC equity markets (see above figure).

<strong>Chinese Economy in Transition</strong>
Since the global financial crisis, China had been reliant on cheaper credit fuelled investments and exports-led model of growth. However, this led to rapid rise in debt levels and created vulnerabilities in fiscal (government debt-to-GDP), real estate (excess housing supply), financial (shadow banking) and corporate (high credit-to-GDP) sectors leading to increasing pressure on financial system and declining investment efficiency.

Credit-to-GDP ratio remains high in China as measured by Bank of International Settlements (BIS) credit gap measure. The increase was fuelled by corporate sector, particularly in real estate and State Owned Enterprises (SOEs).

		<Title>[:en]Challenges for Corporate Intellectual Property Rights in GCC[:ar]التحديات التي تواجه حقوق الملكية الفكرية للشركات في دول مجلس التعاون الخليجي[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]With the growing conversion of intellectual ideas and human creativity into commercial business, the need to protect human efforts at least for a specified period of time increased. The increasing problems of piracy, commercialization and cross border trade pressed the need for national and international protection of human efforts commonly referred to as<strong> Intellectual Property Rights</strong>. The countries in the GCC region have taken efforts for the protection of Intellectual property rights (IPR). However, development of a common legal framework, its implementation and enforcement are major challenges relating to the protection of IPR in GCC. Though the IPR laws are common for all the GCC countries, the registration procedure and legal laws for complaints differ from one country to another. This makes the process of obtaining IPR and legal procedure to claim damage for infringement of rights very complex and time consuming. The complexity in procedures and time and cost involved are major deterrents for the people in the GCC region to apply for patents, trademarks and copyrights.

<strong>Unprecedented Delays</strong>

The delays in issue of patents are very high in GCC countries. In few GCC countries, it takes even 2 years to register and obtain a patent or a trademark.  The differences in procedures followed within the GCC countries for issue and complaints redressal add to the delays.  Authority’s reluctance to award damages in most of the GCC countries lead to lengthy litigation procedures and discourages GCC nationals from registering for IPRs.

<strong>Legal Tangles in IPR laws in GCC</strong>

GCC patents law (1987) and GCC Trademarks Law (2006) govern the policies related to the issuance of patents and trademarks in the GCC region. There is no unified law for the registration of Copyrights in the GCC region. Though legal framework exists, they are either weakly designed or implemented. The filing procedure under the patents law is common with all other legal procedure related to grant of patents, fight against infringements remaining country specific. Kuwait and Qatar do not have systems for the proper examining of filings for patents. In regards to Trademark, UAE is the only country in the GCC region to have taken steps for the recordation of trademarks at customs level. UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar have announced the approval of Trademark law with the status of the other member states still unknown.

The delays and complexity in the enforcement of rights, the insufficient damage awarded in case of infringement and minimal help to the IPR holders from the enforcing agencies have contributed negatively to the establishment of sound and healthy IPR practices in the GCC region.

<strong>Public Disbelief in IPR in GCC</strong>

Lack of transparency and low level of information available in the GCC nations about the patents and trademarks have made it very difficult for individuals, businesses and foreign companies to understand Intellectual Property Rights available in their area of interest in the GCC region. The lack of strong measures to enforce trademarks and patents, the belief that patents are sorts of monopoly in the society and the high fee structures in the GCC region have led to the people’s disbelief about IPRs in the GCC region. Lack of specialised jurisdiction for hearing IPR related cases make GCC a less preferred destination to apply for IPR and fight for infringements. The number of patents and trademarks applied in GCC countries remains low, with the exception of the UAE and Saudi Arabia in case of patents. Trademarks registrations in the Middle East region has increased by c.600% in the past 2 decades. However, a huge number of trademarks still remain unregistered.

Other challenges pertaining to the system of operations, lack of unified laws among GCC countries and very low level of awareness in case of copyrights are deterrents for the increase in IPR registrations in the GCC region. For instance, the GCC patent system is not under the patent Cooperation Treaty due to which filings are accepted only with 12 month priority period. The necessity to register trademarks individually within the GCC countries requires the registrants to tackle the administrative bottlenecks as well as increases the cost. The delay in enacting the unified GCC Trademark law due to the sanctioning delays from GCC Commercial Cooperation Committee has caused problems in the implementation.

GCC countries do not have a unified law for the protection of copyrights as in the case of patents and trademarks. Copyrights and its awareness are comparatively lower than Patents and Trademarks in the GCC. The level of awareness is especially lower in countries like Oman and Kuwait.  The law in the GCC countries related to the copyrights is not clear as for patents and trademarks. GCC countries are required to work more in unison for the creation of a unified framework by encouraging the registration and protection of copyrights in the region.
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
Being a signatory to many conventions for the protection of Intellectual Property Rights, GCC countries have made considerable progress in the protection of IPR in the past 10 years. However, difficulties in obtaining patents, trademarks and copyrights in the GCC region are major hurdles faced and discourage people from registering for obtaining IPR. Awareness about Intellectual property rights in the GCC, both in business and academia is very low. Efforts such as campaigns, seminars and workshops must be conducted to increase the awareness about IPRs in the region. Oman for instance has taken steps for the creation of awareness in the country through seminars with the help of World Intellectual Rights Property Organization (WIPO). The increasing youth entrepreneurs in the GCC region who are tech-savvy will understand the importance of IPR protection. Hence awareness creation will help to encourage the next generation businesses in GCC to protect the Intellectual property.[:ar]With the growing conversion of intellectual ideas and human creativity into commercial business, the need to protect human efforts at least for a specified period of time increased. The increasing problems of piracy, commercialization and cross border trade pressed the need for national and international protection of human efforts commonly referred to as<strong> Intellectual Property Rights</strong>. The countries in the GCC region have taken efforts for the protection of Intellectual property rights (IPR). However, development of a common legal framework, its implementation and enforcement are major challenges relating to the protection of IPR in GCC. Though the IPR laws are common for all the GCC countries, the registration procedure and legal laws for complaints differ from one country to another. This makes the process of obtaining IPR and legal procedure to claim damage for infringement of rights very complex and time consuming. The complexity in procedures and time and cost involved are major deterrents for the people in the GCC region to apply for patents, trademarks and copyrights.

<strong>Unprecedented Delays</strong>

The delays in issue of patents are very high in GCC countries. In few GCC countries, it takes even 2 years to register and obtain a patent or a trademark.  The differences in procedures followed within the GCC countries for issue and complaints redressal add to the delays.  Authority’s reluctance to award damages in most of the GCC countries lead to lengthy litigation procedures and discourages GCC nationals from registering for IPRs.

<strong>Legal Tangles in IPR laws in GCC</strong>

GCC patents law (1987) and GCC Trademarks Law (2006) govern the policies related to the issuance of patents and trademarks in the GCC region. There is no unified law for the registration of Copyrights in the GCC region. Though legal framework exists, they are either weakly designed or implemented. The filing procedure under the patents law is common with all other legal procedure related to grant of patents, fight against infringements remaining country specific. Kuwait and Qatar do not have systems for the proper examining of filings for patents. In regards to Trademark, UAE is the only country in the GCC region to have taken steps for the recordation of trademarks at customs level. UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar have announced the approval of Trademark law with the status of the other member states still unknown.

The delays and complexity in the enforcement of rights, the insufficient damage awarded in case of infringement and minimal help to the IPR holders from the enforcing agencies have contributed negatively to the establishment of sound and healthy IPR practices in the GCC region.

<strong>Public Disbelief in IPR in GCC</strong>

Lack of transparency and low level of information available in the GCC nations about the patents and trademarks have made it very difficult for individuals, businesses and foreign companies to understand Intellectual Property Rights available in their area of interest in the GCC region. The lack of strong measures to enforce trademarks and patents, the belief that patents are sorts of monopoly in the society and the high fee structures in the GCC region have led to the people’s disbelief about IPRs in the GCC region. Lack of specialised jurisdiction for hearing IPR related cases make GCC a less preferred destination to apply for IPR and fight for infringements. The number of patents and trademarks applied in GCC countries remains low, with the exception of the UAE and Saudi Arabia in case of patents. Trademarks registrations in the Middle East region has increased by c.600% in the past 2 decades. However, a huge number of trademarks still remain unregistered.

Other challenges pertaining to the system of operations, lack of unified laws among GCC countries and very low level of awareness in case of copyrights are deterrents for the increase in IPR registrations in the GCC region. For instance, the GCC patent system is not under the patent Cooperation Treaty due to which filings are accepted only with 12 month priority period. The necessity to register trademarks individually within the GCC countries requires the registrants to tackle the administrative bottlenecks as well as increases the cost. The delay in enacting the unified GCC Trademark law due to the sanctioning delays from GCC Commercial Cooperation Committee has caused problems in the implementation.

GCC countries do not have a unified law for the protection of copyrights as in the case of patents and trademarks. Copyrights and its awareness are comparatively lower than Patents and Trademarks in the GCC. The level of awareness is especially lower in countries like Oman and Kuwait.  The law in the GCC countries related to the copyrights is not clear as for patents and trademarks. GCC countries are required to work more in unison for the creation of a unified framework by encouraging the registration and protection of copyrights in the region.
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
Being a signatory to many conventions for the protection of Intellectual Property Rights, GCC countries have made considerable progress in the protection of IPR in the past 10 years. However, difficulties in obtaining patents, trademarks and copyrights in the GCC region are major hurdles faced and discourage people from registering for obtaining IPR. Awareness about Intellectual property rights in the GCC, both in business and academia is very low. Efforts such as campaigns, seminars and workshops must be conducted to increase the awareness about IPRs in the region. Oman for instance has taken steps for the creation of awareness in the country through seminars with the help of World Intellectual Rights Property Organization (WIPO). The increasing youth entrepreneurs in the GCC region who are tech-savvy will understand the importance of IPR protection. Hence awareness creation will help to encourage the next generation businesses in GCC to protect the Intellectual property.[:]]]></Content>

Within a week after the July 14, 2015, announcement was made with respect to a historic nuclear deal on the Iranian nuclear programme, the Iranian oil minister said that “(w)e expect the members of OPEC to pave the ground for (an) increase of Iran's oil production that will reach global markets when sanctions are lifted," If Iranian nuclear compliance to the deal succeeds in bringing about the concomitant removal of sanctions, then Tehran could gain access to about $150 billion in frozen assets, allowing the country to increase oil to 4 million barrels/day by 2017, according to Moody’s. For several countries of the GCC, this means depressed oil prices into the foreseeable future.

For those Gulf countries that do not enjoy the luxury of significant fiscal buffers, depressed oil prices over the long term will mean weakened national balance sheets. Tehran's ~$100 billion stock market will also receive increased attention, which means international hot money will try to derive benefits from a hitherto closed, but fundamentally attractive, market . However, GCC countries like the Oman and the UAE have trading links with Iran, which could get further bolstered if Iran gets increasingly integrated into the international financial mainstream. For Kuwait, removal of sanctions on Iran could mean access to import Iranian gas, as the country’s natural gas requirements grow .

The Iranian nuclear narrative has seen several twists and turns over the past several years. Iran has been under sanctions in one form or the other for over three decades now. According to <a title="Marmore Report - Geopolitical and Macroeconomic Implications of the Iranian Nuclear Deal for GCC" href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/geopolitical-and-macroeconomic-implications-of-the-iranian-nuclear-deal-for-gcc-bilingual/">Marmore’s Report</a>, an Iranian nuclear deal has significant geopolitical as well as investment implications, along with the fact that there are anticipations of removal of sanctions in a phased manner.

<br />
Between the middle of 2014 and early 2015, the average price of Brent crude fell from $115.7/bbl to $45.19/bbl, a decline of about 60% . Closer to the end of August 2015, the price had further declined to the level of the $40s . According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the U.S. is set to produce 9.36 million barrels per day through 2015, an increase of about 7.5% over 2014. However, the prediction for 2016 by the U.S. EIA indicates annual crude oil production of 8.96 million barrels per day. Is the forecast decline in 2016 an indicator that shale producers in the U.S. could come under pressure?<br />
<br />
With the pressure on the oil price continuing unabated, there is some empirical evidence that it is having an impact on shale producers. The number of rigs in America has been declining steadily since oil prices started to fall. From 1,609 rigs in October 2014, the number of shale rigs fell to about 674 by August 25, 2015 . Independent oil companies in the U.S. are already under a combined debt bill of $235 billion . The downward volatility in oil prices has made investing in shale a highly risky proposition for banks and investors. In October 2015, American banks will reevaluate drillers&rsquo; lines of credit. These evaluations are largely based on the value of reserves. Downward pressure on international oil prices means that many shale drillers, especially smaller ones, could be cut off from critical funding.<br />
<br />
However, there are arguments that shale production will continue to prove resilient, especially on the back of productivity gains. Some analysts point out that the marginal cost of oil from the American shale plays in North Dakota and Texas have fallen from $70 per barrel to about $50-$60 . There are more optimistic estimates that indicate breakeven prices of about $40, or even $30, in some shale areas. The media in the U.S. has reported that drilling is &ldquo;[&hellip;] still cost-effective down to prices of $10 per barrel to maintain many existing wells across the United States, which is why drillers have not shut in production.&rdquo; &nbsp;In an environment of low oil prices, shale drillers have been compelled to adopt new technologies and continuously optimize cost structures.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The resilience of shale will be closely tied into impending supply and demand dynamics. Though the U.S. shale oil production amounted to only 5 million barrels per day by the close of 2014, i.e., around 6% of global production and consumption; its emergence in the middle of the industry cost curve meant that it has accounted for over 50% of the increase in world supplies since 2010 . In its June 2015 meeting, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) decided to keep its member countries&#39; collective target of 30 million barrels a day unchanged over the following six months in order to defend market share in the face of rising unconventional oil output. OPEC&rsquo; strategy of not seeking production cuts to underwrite the global oil price will hit American shale producers hard. For instance, in early August 2015, the CEO of Pioneer Natural Resources Co., a leading independent energy producing company in the U.S., stated: &nbsp;"If oil prices go to $40 and stay at $40 for the next 18 months, we&#39;ll most likely slow down. But as long as our hedge positions and the (futures) strip occurs, there&#39;s no reason at this point in time to slow down."&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thus, a sustained low oil price environment in the neighbourhood of $40 or below may cause serious disruptions among many U.S. shale producers, who may find it unfeasible to deploy additional capital. However, OPEC may find itself faced with a persistent headwind as well. This is due to the fact that the shale technology and infrastructure would be on continuous standby, given the large sunk costs, to take advantage of any increase in global oil prices. Each episode of increase in global oil prices could be met with almost instantaneous production ramp up on the part of shale producers. Moreover, OPEC will likely find it difficult to sustain a consensus over long time periods, given the fact that OPEC countries like Iran and Venezuela have budgetary oil price break-even prices that are markedly north of the $100 mark.&nbsp;<br />

<br />
The international supply and demand scenario is undergoing a period of pronounced turbulence. The case of the key Chinese economy, following unexpected devaluation of the Yuan and the tremors in the Chinese capital markets in August 2015, is a cause of concern for many oil producing nations. Elsewhere, in Europe, too, the recovery is extremely lax and automobiles are getting more and more fuel efficient. Thus, the portents for a reduction in demand for crude oil are getting enhanced. &nbsp;Conversely, the recent nuclear deal between Iran and the major world powers may lead to a quick lifting of sanctions, allowing Tehran to pump more crude. Iran is determined to take back its lost market share of over 1 million barrels per day that it lost due to biting sanctions imposed in 2012.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thus, in the global oil market place, a plethora of players have developed that has injected much unpredictability into the system. The current search is for a new equilibrium in terms of oil price that can satisfy multiple players. Despite multiple forecasts as to what that price is; it is only the market and the unpredictable interactions between multiple players within it that can finally provide the answer. The fate of shale will depend upon finding a niche in that evolving balance.[:ar]<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="2" width="100%">

Between the middle of 2014 and early 2015, the average price of Brent crude fell from $115.7/bbl to $45.19/bbl, a decline of about 60% . Closer to the end of August 2015, the price had further declined to the level of the $40s . According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the U.S. is set to produce 9.36 million barrels per day through 2015, an increase of about 7.5% over 2014. However, the prediction for 2016 by the U.S. EIA indicates annual crude oil production of 8.96 million barrels per day. Is the forecast decline in 2016 an indicator that shale producers in the U.S. could come under pressure?<br />
<br />
With the pressure on the oil price continuing unabated, there is some empirical evidence that it is having an impact on shale producers. The number of rigs in America has been declining steadily since oil prices started to fall. From 1,609 rigs in October 2014, the number of shale rigs fell to about 674 by August 25, 2015 . Independent oil companies in the U.S. are already under a combined debt bill of $235 billion . The downward volatility in oil prices has made investing in shale a highly risky proposition for banks and investors. In October 2015, American banks will reevaluate drillers&rsquo; lines of credit. These evaluations are largely based on the value of reserves. Downward pressure on international oil prices means that many shale drillers, especially smaller ones, could be cut off from critical funding.<br />
<br />
However, there are arguments that shale production will continue to prove resilient, especially on the back of productivity gains. Some analysts point out that the marginal cost of oil from the American shale plays in North Dakota and Texas have fallen from $70 per barrel to about $50-$60 . There are more optimistic estimates that indicate breakeven prices of about $40, or even $30, in some shale areas. The media in the U.S. has reported that drilling is &ldquo;[&hellip;] still cost-effective down to prices of $10 per barrel to maintain many existing wells across the United States, which is why drillers have not shut in production.&rdquo; &nbsp;In an environment of low oil prices, shale drillers have been compelled to adopt new technologies and continuously optimize cost structures.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The resilience of shale will be closely tied into impending supply and demand dynamics. Though the U.S. shale oil production amounted to only 5 million barrels per day by the close of 2014, i.e., around 6% of global production and consumption; its emergence in the middle of the industry cost curve meant that it has accounted for over 50% of the increase in world supplies since 2010 . In its June 2015 meeting, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) decided to keep its member countries&#39; collective target of 30 million barrels a day unchanged over the following six months in order to defend market share in the face of rising unconventional oil output. OPEC&rsquo; strategy of not seeking production cuts to underwrite the global oil price will hit American shale producers hard. For instance, in early August 2015, the CEO of Pioneer Natural Resources Co., a leading independent energy producing company in the U.S., stated: &nbsp;&quot;If oil prices go to $40 and stay at $40 for the next 18 months, we&#39;ll most likely slow down. But as long as our hedge positions and the (futures) strip occurs, there&#39;s no reason at this point in time to slow down.&quot;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thus, a sustained low oil price environment in the neighbourhood of $40 or below may cause serious disruptions among many U.S. shale producers, who may find it unfeasible to deploy additional capital. However, OPEC may find itself faced with a persistent headwind as well. This is due to the fact that the shale technology and infrastructure would be on continuous standby, given the large sunk costs, to take advantage of any increase in global oil prices. Each episode of increase in global oil prices could be met with almost instantaneous production ramp up on the part of shale producers. Moreover, OPEC will likely find it difficult to sustain a consensus over long time periods, given the fact that OPEC countries like Iran and Venezuela have budgetary oil price break-even prices that are markedly north of the $100 mark.&nbsp;<br />

<br />
The international supply and demand scenario is undergoing a period of pronounced turbulence. The case of the key Chinese economy, following unexpected devaluation of the Yuan and the tremors in the Chinese capital markets in August 2015, is a cause of concern for many oil producing nations. Elsewhere, in Europe, too, the recovery is extremely lax and automobiles are getting more and more fuel efficient. Thus, the portents for a reduction in demand for crude oil are getting enhanced. &nbsp;Conversely, the recent nuclear deal between Iran and the major world powers may lead to a quick lifting of sanctions, allowing Tehran to pump more crude. Iran is determined to take back its lost market share of over 1 million barrels per day that it lost due to biting sanctions imposed in 2012.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thus, in the global oil market place, a plethora of players have developed that has injected much unpredictability into the system. The current search is for a new equilibrium in terms of oil price that can satisfy multiple players. Despite multiple forecasts as to what that price is; it is only the market and the unpredictable interactions between multiple players within it that can finally provide the answer. The fate of shale will depend upon finding a niche in that evolving balance.[:]]]></Content>

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]Traditionally in the Middle East and North Africa (Mena), SMEs have found it difficult to access funding from banks. In the GCC countries, the share of SME loans in total bank loans has tended to be around 2%, as the following graphic illustrates.

Entrepreneurs in the GCC, with respect to receiving bank loans, are known to face time-consuming documentation, daunting penalties on early repayments, shorter repayment periods, higher interest rates in comparison with large corporate borrowers, etc . Banks, on the other hand, contend that higher premiums and extensive documentation are required as steps towards protecting riskier lending propositions, along with the fact that there is added pressure on liquidity due to lower oil prices. The reluctance of banks to lend to SMEs in the GCC portend that there is space for innovative funding practices like international funding for GCC SMEs and through domestic venture capital funds. Several countries in the advanced economies bracket have already developed venture fund models such as limited partnerships and limited liability companies. This has been noted by analysts as conducive to maintaining a viable balance between regulatory protection and encouraging entrepreneurship. Given the drive towards innovation in many of the countries in the Mena region, it is time to explore innovative financing mechanisms, as well, such as institutionalized funding sources for SMEs focused on innovation.

There are signs of innovative financing mechanisms being adopted within the GCC. In September 2014, Dubai SME, the agency of Dubai's Department of Economic Development (DED) that is tasked with developing the SME sector, launched the Equity Investment Initiative (EII). The EII targets capital infusion into the SME sector through equity participation of venture capitalists, angel investors, private equity firms etc. It has also been reported that Dubai SME is compiling a domestic directory of angel equity investors focused on SMEs. The effort is part of a survey on SME equity funding needs.

There are some global examples that the GCC can adopt. One example is the InnovFin initiative of the EU. InnovFin is a joint initiative by the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Investment Fund (EIF), in cooperation with the European Commission (EC). The InnovFin SME Venture Capital offers equity finance for research and innovation through selected intermediaries like investment funds, venture capital funds or vehicles that support co-investment facilities for Business Angels. Non-institutional participation, in the form of opening up SMEs to investments in the stock exchanges could also be explored. For instance, India opened the SME segment platform in 2012, for listing SMEs in its main stock exchange. Public sector banks could also be encouraged to hold stocks in promising SMEs.

While courting private equity (PE) for SMEs, one problem that could come up is that they might be more interested in companies from the tech sector or the digital environment. These might leave SMEs trying to focus on traditional manufacturing shortchanged. Lack of enough information about the company fundamentals, the promoters and lower returns could force PEs to look upon manufacturing SMEs unfavourably. Thus, the government could look into policies that may help SMEs that cannot attract much PE attention with better public financing options. The concept of the ‘Fund of Funds’ (FoF) can also help. Many observers comment that governments need not be adept in identifying promising SMEs. Thus, instead of directly funneling investments into companies, the government can invest into VCs that can in turn scout for viable and promising funding opportunities. One such example is The Dansk Vækstkapital (Danish Growth Capital) of Denmark, which is a partially public investment fund-of-funds that invests in small cap, mid cap, venture and mezzanine funds. The Dansk Vækstkapital only invests in funds and not directly into Danish companies. Businesses will have to apply for financing directly at financial institutions that take part in the Dansk Vækstkapital programme.

Crowdfunding is another concept that SMEs in the GCC may find very useful. The U.S. Small Business Administration defines crowdfunding as “[…] a collective cooperation of people who network and pool their money and resources together, usually via the Inter­net, to support efforts initiated by other organizations.” It need not just be other organizations, but it can also be individuals. Crowdfunding channels the enthusiasm of digital social networks to raise finances and pool resources for supporting a project important to members of the social network. It would be useful to look into the broad classifications of crowdfunding that currently exist.

GCC’s first crowdfunding plan is Aflamnah, a UAE-based platform that allows individuals from the Middle East region to raise funds for fresh ideas in areas like films, games, television, art, music, etc. It is crucial to not allow vacuums of legislations to develop around key aspects of crowdfunding once the overall official recognition is provided. Peer-to-peer lending is particularly ripe for adoption across the GCC, as many SMEs have expressed that having rapid access to capital, with minimized red tape, and at interest rates much lower than traditional banks is critical for the early stage phase.

Experiences from across the Mena region indicate that a number of SMEs, estimated at about 20%-25% of the total, prefer sharia-compliant products . Thus, better risk management protocols would strengthen lenders’ confidence to create more sharia-compliant financing options. Risk management frameworks that protect lender's’ rights and address their concerns for transparent information could not only strengthen the evolution of Islamic finance with respect to SMEs, but allow traditional banks to develop more confidence in lending to SMEs, as well.[:ar]Traditionally in the Middle East and North Africa (Mena), SMEs have found it difficult to access funding from banks.

		<Title>[:en]Fuel Price Hike in the UAE[:ar]ارتفاع أسعار الوقود في الإمارات العربية المتحدة[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]In July 2015, the UAE announced that, effective from August 1, 2015, it was moving from a system of fixed and subsidized fuel prices to a system of adjusting prices monthly, in line with global price trends . Though the exact details of the pricing formula were not released, it was made clear that the prices would be based on the average global prices, along with the addition of operating costs. In effect, the price of petrol would register an increase of nearly 25% . The fuel price deregulation moves the prices of fuels in the UAE closer to international peers, as the following graph illustrates.

In the UAE, energy subsidies are equivalent to 5.6% of GDP, according to the International Energy Agency (IMF). According to the IMF, petroleum subsidies in the UAE amount to about $7 billion (per year) and are part of a package of energy subsidies that total close to $30 billion . The fuel subsidies cut in the UAE speaks to a larger pattern in several parts of the world, wherein energy producing countries like Angola, Indonesia, Egypt, Gabon, etc., have recently slashed domestic fuel subsidies as the national budgets come under pressure due to lower oil prices . Reports indicate that fuel subsidies cut in the Egypt, in mid-2014, led to the price of fuel at the pump increasing by about 80% .

There are benefits for the UAE on the macroeconomic level. Reducing fuel subsidies is likely to benefit the budget directly, thereby supporting efforts to offset declines in oil revenues. According to the IMF, the GCC spends 3.4% of its GDP on fuel subsides, which contrasts heavily with those of the advanced economies that spend less than 0.1% . Though there can be no direct meaningful comparison between the fuel subsidization rates of traditional oil majors and the advanced economies, it is, nevertheless, useful to be closer to the international mainstream patterns in terms of spending on subsidies. That would likely increase the interest of foreign investors, who can chalk it up as efforts against combatting extravagant spending.

Moreover, a move towards a flexible pricing system is likely to increase uptake of fuel-efficient automobiles, thereby benefiting the environment and reducing pollution levels. It is notable that the transport sector is responsible for close to a quarter of the total greenhouse emissions in the UAE . In 2013, the latest year for which definitive data is available, the UAE’s carbon dioxide footprint amounted to a staggering 44.6 million tons. Thus, investments in public transport and related infrastructure could also see a boost, as a result of deregulation. Also, economic diversification efforts can receive further resources, such as the recently announced authority to “[…] lead the development of creative industries in Dubai to support the Dubai Strategy for Innovation” (The Dubai Creative Clusters Authority).

Figure: Dubai Creative Clusters Authority (DCCA)
<img style="width: 447px; height: 437px;" title="Dubai-Creative-Cluster.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Fuel-Price-Hike-in-the-UAE-fig2.jpg" alt="Dubai-Creative-Cluster.jpg" />

The DCCA follows the attempts of the UAE to make the country a global innovation hub, as per which the new authority replaced the Dubai Technology and Media Free Zone Authority in June 2015 . Savings got from restriction of fuel subsidies can be used to develop authorities like the DCCA. The DCCA has the ambition of making Dubai the eminent choice for creative and innovative businesses, and aims to gear up the capacities and infrastructure for innovation quickly so that the Dubai Expo 2020 can be used to showcase the city’s ability to support cutting-edge innovation enterprises.

For the UAE, the fuel price deregulation is part of a broader package of strategic reorientation of the economy. In July 2015, the UAE Minister of Energy, Mr. Suhail Al Mazroui, had remarked that the “[…] resolution is in line with the strategic vision of the UAE government in diversifying sources of income, strengthening the economy and increasing its competitiveness in addition to building a strong economy that is not dependent on government subsidies,” Notably, the idea is to bring the UAE on par with countries that follow more disciplined economic methodologies that limits excessive government spending and encourages private sector enterprise. Thereby, it is hoped that the UAE will be able to further its competitive position across several international indices, like the World Bank Doing Business reports, which would increase the ability to attract more foreign investments.

A fuel price committee has been set up to review fuel prices for benchmarking against average international levels, before announcing them for the following month. The exact details of the pricing formula are not available. In the eyes of the international investor community, market-based pricing mechanisms would indicate a commitment towards a free-market economy with little direct interference from the bureaucracy. This is likely to strengthen the capacities for building a sustainable economy that is supported on open market standards. The deregulation move is likely to further strengthen the status of UAE as an “[…] attractive destination for foreign investments, complementing its advanced legislative economic environment, state of the art infrastructure, ease of conducting business, free movement of capital, and other competitive features that set the country’s economy apart from others.”

The DCCA follows the attempts of the UAE to make the country a global innovation hub, as per which the new authority replaced the Dubai Technology and Media Free Zone Authority in June 2015 . Savings got from restriction of fuel subsidies can be used to develop authorities like the DCCA. The DCCA has the ambition of making Dubai the eminent choice for creative and innovative businesses, and aims to gear up the capacities and infrastructure for innovation quickly so that the Dubai Expo 2020 can be used to showcase the city’s ability to support cutting-edge innovation enterprises.

For the UAE, the fuel price deregulation is part of a broader package of strategic reorientation of the economy. In July 2015, the UAE Minister of Energy, Mr. Suhail Al Mazroui, had remarked that the “[…] resolution is in line with the strategic vision of the UAE government in diversifying sources of income, strengthening the economy and increasing its competitiveness in addition to building a strong economy that is not dependent on government subsidies,” Notably, the idea is to bring the UAE on par with countries that follow more disciplined economic methodologies that limits excessive government spending and encourages private sector enterprise. Thereby, it is hoped that the UAE will be able to further its competitive position across several international indices, like the World Bank Doing Business reports, which would increase the ability to attract more foreign investments.

A fuel price committee has been set up to review fuel prices for benchmarking against average international levels, before announcing them for the following month. The exact details of the pricing formula are not available. In the eyes of the international investor community, market-based pricing mechanisms would indicate a commitment towards a free-market economy with little direct interference from the bureaucracy. This is likely to strengthen the capacities for building a sustainable economy that is supported on open market standards. The deregulation move is likely to further strengthen the status of UAE as an “[…] attractive destination for foreign investments, complementing its advanced legislative economic environment, state of the art infrastructure, ease of conducting business, free movement of capital, and other competitive features that set the country’s economy apart from others.”

		<Title>[:en]Fast Tracking Reforms in the UAE through Spending Cuts[:ar]الإصلاحات في الإمارات العربية المتحدة من خلال تخفيضات في الانفاق[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]A report released by the UAE central bank towards the end of July 2015 indicated that the government is likely to cut spending by 4.2% in the fiscal year of 2015. According to the report, consolidated government spending is expected to decline to Dh460.6bn ($125.5 bn), from Dh480.8bn ($131 bn) in 2014. It is notable that the projected spending cut is the first such instance in 13 years. Many analysts pin the reason for the spending cut on the recent decline in oil prices. The reduction is a reversal in the trend of growing state spending in the UAE, which grew at an average rate of 12%, every year, since 2004.

Also, the UAE’s spending on subsidies is projected to fall by 34.3% to Dh13bn in 2015, a reduction of Dh6.8bn over the previous year. The fiscal conservatism on the part of the UAE is seen as a reflection of the announcement from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that the UAE will register its first fiscal deficit in 2015, since 2009. In July 2015, the UAE also announced that, effective from August 1, 2015, it was moving from a system of fixed and subsidized fuel prices to a system of adjusting prices monthly, in line with global price trends. Though the exact details of the pricing formula were not released, it was made clear that the prices would be based on the average global prices, along with the addition of operating costs.

The pursuit of reformsis causing investors and analysts to look upon the UAE more favourably.  The feeling has been expressed by investors that diminishing the fuel subsidies will enhance the credit profile of the country. Moody’s expects that “[…] removing fuel subsidies will reduce the UAE’s consolidated fiscal deficit by 0.4% of GDP this year and contribute another 0.6% of GDP to the fiscal balance in 2016, […].” A strong push for reforms in the UAE, according to the media in other GCC countries, has placed the UAE “[…] at the forefront among Gulf states in pushing through reforms to curb spending and raise new revenue in an era of cheap oil.”

The savings from the cut backs in spending are expected to further strengthen the UAE’s infrastructure and competitiveness, as more money will become available for strategic investments that can bring in more foreign investments. For instance, the government of Abu Dhabi is accelerating investment efforts in terms of large-scale infrastructure efforts such as the Khalifa Industrial Zone and the Masdar city. The UAE government’s spending on new projects across multiple parts of the country would support non-oil growth, including services, transport, tourism, construction, etc.

Moreover, the cut backs can support a programme of sustainable economic development. For instance, with three million cars on the streets of the UAE, which are growing at about 9% per annum, removal of fuel subsidies is likely to encourage a greater uptake for public transportation. This will have a direct impact on the environment in terms of reduced pollution due to diminished emission levels. By adopting a programme of intelligent cost cutting, the UAE appears to be leading the way in terms of the realization that countries that move towards sustainable growth models rather than hinging on highly regulated subsidized economic frameworks are more likely to thrive and compete better into the future.

Traditionally, in the UAE, Dubai has been considered to be in the forefront in terms of diversification efforts. Increasingly, other centers such as Abu Dhabi have been able to find their own competitive niches in various segments. It is notable that the Abu Dhabi’s manufacturing industries sector accounted for 12.6% of the emirate’s non-oil GDP in 2013. Petrochemicals and plastics are the top manufacturing sectors, accounting for around 50% of the manufacturing industries’ production and about 73% of the fixed capital formation. However, basic metal industries, like aluminium and iron, are rising in prominence as well, accounting for 11% of the production value of manufacturing industries sector in 2013. Savings from government spending can also be moved into other visionary programmes like the UAE’s space programme, which is expected to “[…] underpin an industrial base that will support research and development between companies and enhance technical skills of the workforce.”

As the government saves more money, it will be able to channel more resources into essential areas such as healthcare and education, too. As reforms continue to gather pace in the UAE, it can provide synergies to strengths built over the last few decades. Over 25% of the world's 500 largest companies have based their operational headquarters for the Mena region in the UAE. The volume of foreign investments that has entered the country over the past decade has exceeded $100 billion. Looking into the future, the UAE’s Vision 2021 plan targets FDI equivalent of about 5% of what will be the nation's total GDP in 2021 (from 2.66% in 2014). Pursuit of effective reforms in a coordinated and clinical manner can significantly increase the UAE’s profile, and thus, the chances of achieving such ambitious goals.[:ar]A report released by the UAE central bank towards the end of July 2015 indicated that the government is likely to cut spending by 4.2% in the fiscal year of 2015.

		<Title>[:en]Implications of removing Currency Peg for GCC[:ar]الآثار المترتبة على إلغاء ربط سعر صرف العملة لدول مجلس التعاون الخليجي[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<strong>Key Questions</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>What is currency pegging? Why do countries opt for it?</strong><br />
<br />
When a country fixes the exchange rate of its currency to another country&rsquo;s currency to control the value of a currency, it is known as currency pegging or "fixed exchange rate" or "pegged exchange rate". For example, if a country pegs its currency to the U.S. dollar, the value of its currency will be controlled so that it rises and falls with the dollar.<br />
<br />
The reason why countries opt for a fixed exchange rate or currency peg is to avoids currency fluctuation and eliminate the uncertainty due to exchange fluctuations in international transactions. Higher fluctuations and uncertainties imply firms are not willing to invest in export capacity, lest the value of the currency diminishes. On the other hand, a stable domestic currency and a fixed exchange rate imply that traders do not have to face currency risks, and therefore will be more willing to invest and facilitate trade.<br />
<br />
Secondly, a country can maintain trading advantage and protect its economic interest through currency pegging. This is because pegging avoids inflation when the dollar appreciates, causing domestic currency to depreciate.&nbsp; This increases the price of import of raw material and is passed on to the consumers as the price of final products rise. On the other hand, the fall in dollar value will increase price of exports, affecting the competitiveness of domestic firms in the international market. China is one country which pegs the Yuan to the dollar to maintain competitive pricing. GCC countries peg their currencies to the dollar as they export oil in dollars.<br />
<br />
<strong>How have GCC countries pegged their currencies? What are the benefits and disadvantages?</strong><br />
<br />
Kuwait adopted an exchange rate policy pegging the Kuwaiti Dinar (KD) to a weighted basket of major currencies. That policy based the determination of the KD exchange rate on a special weighted basket of currencies of the countries that have significant trade and financial relations with the State of Kuwait.&nbsp;. The other GCC nations have pegged their currencies to the US dollar. Pegged currency in the GCC region has ensured limited transmission of exchange rate fluctuation to the economies. This is a major advantage as international oil prices are quoted in dollars, and linking currencies to the dollar leads to stability of export earnings and protects from probable exchange risks. GCC countries are China&rsquo;s largest oil suppliers. The US dollar is being used as the principal currency for oil trade as opposed to Chinese Yuan, as dollar is the default currency for oil trade.<br />
<br />
The GCC countries have always been protected from impact of regional crises such as Iraq war and tension over Iran&rsquo;s disputed nuclear program. Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s financial market being highly correlated to US markets due to the currency peg gives foreign investors an opportunity to invest in emerging economies. This promotes diversification minus exchange rate risks and investment inflow for the GCC region based host country.<br />
GCC economies have not moved at par with the US economy over the last few years. GCC policy makers have to replicate the U.S. Central bank&rsquo;s monetary policy, even if it is not required in these countries. GCC economies that rely on oil prices face the risk of slowing down if there is a decline in oil prices.<br />
<br />
Currency pegging also leads to a loss in monetary policy flexibility as the countries who peg their currencies have to mandatorily replicate the US Fed&rsquo;s monetary policy.<br />
<br />
<strong>What are the possible future implications of retaining currency peg in GCC countries?</strong><br />
<br />
The U.S. economy is expanding which means the Federal Reserve may soon increase interest rates this year. The economic condition of GCC countries is different than that of the US economy, as they face a risk of slowing down due to decline in oil revenues as a result of lower oil prices. If the US Fed increases interest rates, the GCC central banks have to follow suit as they don&rsquo;t have their own monetary policy. If the GCC countries increase interest rates, it will further hamper growth of the already slowing economies. If the GCC countries do not follow suit, there will be a gap in interest rates between the US and GCC countries. Currency pegs to the dollar along with high interest rate gaps could lead to arbitrage opportunities.<br />
GCC Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) holds more than USD 2 trillion, with Saudi Arabia, U.A.E, Kuwait and Qatar in the Top 10 biggest SWF. Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) holds around 80% of its investments in US treasury bills. An increase in interest rate could trigger a large sale of Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s investments in US treasury bills, leading to panic selling in US dollar globally. This could lead to a sudden drop in the value of the US dollar, in turn pulling down the exchange rate of the pegged GCC currencies.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>What will be the implications if GCC countries move away from currency peg?</strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Monetary policy flexibility</strong></li>
</ol>
Removing the currency peg would imply that the GCC countries have the freedom to design their own monetary policy according to the domestic economic scenario. This will enable adjustment of interest rates to allow money supply to flow according the economic situation and help to counter inflation while sustaining economic growth. If the countries follow a floating exchange rate, there will be volatility, but more flexibility to manage macroeconomic shocks better.

<ol>
	<li value="2"><strong>Monetary unification</strong></li>
</ol>
The currency peg was intended towards monetary unification of GCC nations. Removing the peg would imply that this would fall apart, with UAE and Oman already having pulled out of monetary unification.

<ol>
	<li value="3"><strong>Exchange rate risk</strong></li>
</ol>
An unpredictable and unstable situation arising out of exchange rate fluctuation could lead to transaction risks if pegging is removed. Companies involved in international trade could face losses due to fluctuations arising out of prior financial obligations, making investment decisions and international trade riskier. A major portion of the GDP of GCC countries consists of exports and imports, with oil being the main export. Since oil price is fixed in dollars, any exchange rate fluctuation could drastically reduce revenues if currency is un-pegged.

<ol>
	<li value="4"><strong>Balance of Payment (BoP)</strong></li>
</ol>
When exchange rate fluctuates and dollar appreciates, imports will be costlier compared to exports, leading to Current Account Deficit, impacting Balance of payment (BOP). Since oil is priced in dollars, some GCC countries are hesitant to give up the US Dollar peg as they prefer a stable currency to a flexible monetary policy.<br />
<br />
<strong>What are the options if the countries decide to move away from Dollar peg?</strong><br />
<br />
The first option could be pegging currencies to a trade weighted basket comprising of major currencies. &nbsp;This will counter exposure to any single currency volatility. If GCC nations opt for monetary unification by adopting a single currency, they will have to price oil or invoice revenues in the common currency as opposed to the US Dollar currently. A managed float or free float can be achieved if oil is priced in the common currency, without having to peg it to any other currency. Two alternatives are possible - either the oil pricing and collection of revenues can be done in the common currency or oil price can be listed in US dollar and the revenues can be collected in the unified currency.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thus, removal of currency peg is of greater advantage to the GCC countries as they will gain from exchange rate flexibility with strong Forex reserve. They will be better placed to absorb currency shocks in the short run. Although, GCC countries can fully shield their respective currencies, a flexible exchange rate should be aimed for over the long term.<br />

An increase in interest rate could trigger a large sale of Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s investments in US treasury bills, leading to panic selling in US dollar globally. This could lead to a sudden drop in the value of the US dollar, in turn pulling down the exchange rate of the pegged GCC currencies.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>What will be the implications if GCC countries move away from currency peg?</strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Monetary policy flexibility</strong></li>
</ol>
Removing the currency peg would imply that the GCC countries have the freedom to design their own monetary policy according to the domestic economic scenario. This will enable adjustment of interest rates to allow money supply to flow according the economic situation and help to counter inflation while sustaining economic growth. If the countries follow a floating exchange rate, there will be volatility, but more flexibility to manage macroeconomic shocks better.

<ol>
	<li value="2"><strong>Monetary unification</strong></li>
</ol>
The currency peg was intended towards monetary unification of GCC nations. Removing the peg would imply that this would fall apart, with UAE and Oman already having pulled out of monetary unification.

<ol>
	<li value="3"><strong>Exchange rate risk</strong></li>
</ol>
An unpredictable and unstable situation arising out of exchange rate fluctuation could lead to transaction risks if pegging is removed. Companies involved in international trade could face losses due to fluctuations arising out of prior financial obligations, making investment decisions and international trade riskier. A major portion of the GDP of GCC countries consists of exports and imports, with oil being the main export. Since oil price is fixed in dollars, any exchange rate fluctuation could drastically reduce revenues if currency is un-pegged.

<ol>
	<li value="4"><strong>Balance of Payment (BoP)</strong></li>
</ol>
When exchange rate fluctuates and dollar appreciates, imports will be costlier compared to exports, leading to Current Account Deficit, impacting Balance of payment (BOP). Since oil is priced in dollars, some GCC countries are hesitant to give up the US Dollar peg as they prefer a stable currency to a flexible monetary policy.<br />
<br />
<strong>What are the options if the countries decide to move away from Dollar peg?</strong><br />
<br />
The first option could be pegging currencies to a trade weighted basket comprising of major currencies. &nbsp;This will counter exposure to any single currency volatility. If GCC nations opt for monetary unification by adopting a single currency, they will have to price oil or invoice revenues in the common currency as opposed to the US Dollar currently. A managed float or free float can be achieved if oil is priced in the common currency, without having to peg it to any other currency. Two alternatives are possible - either the oil pricing and collection of revenues can be done in the common currency or oil price can be listed in US dollar and the revenues can be collected in the unified currency.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thus, removal of currency peg is of greater advantage to the GCC countries as they will gain from exchange rate flexibility with strong Forex reserve. They will be better placed to absorb currency shocks in the short run. Although, GCC countries can fully shield their respective currencies, a flexible exchange rate should be aimed for over the long term.<br />

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]The landscape of Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s real estate market is set to change with the ushering in of a slew of mortgage laws. However, things were challenging before the law, and the following data tells us exactly why.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Suppose, you are 20-something and draw SAR 6500-7700 a month. In that case, for two reasons, you will not be able to afford a decent home. One, the down payment for the house is approximately 14 months of your salary. If you habitually save 25% of your earnings, you will have to work for six full years to save this sum. Two, under the Regulations for Consumer Credit, 2006, your EMI on all borrowing (including credit cards) cannot exceed 33% of monthly salary. These straight away set the affordability level, which isn&rsquo;t high as&nbsp; the property prices are steep.&nbsp; Little wonder, banks prefer to lend to the 30-45 years age-group who have stable jobs rather than the young ones, who have just begun their career.<br />
<br />
<strong>Key features of the new law</strong><br />
Saudi banks have a strong balance sheet and extensive reach. This gives them an upper hand in the mortgage business over private finance companies due to which they are likely to corner a majority of the market. The law must help lay out a level playing field.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The new mortgage law comprises five laws: Real Estate Finance Law, Finance Lease Law, Law on Supervision of Finance Companies, Registered Real Estate Mortgage Law and Enforcement (Execution) Law. All these laws aim at enhancing the number of participants such as banks and finance companies in the real estate sector as well as providing regulatory power to government agencies like the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA).<br />

These laws will provide a legal structure for mortgage registration, foreclosure, and regulation of financing companies, including those active in real estate. We will see an overhaul the kingdom&rsquo;s home-finance market ranging from registering mortgages to allowing judges to prosecute police officers who fail to carry out eviction orders. The changes are expected to increase residential lending to about USD32 billion annually. There will be a creation of licensed private mortgage providers as well as a state-run company for refinancing resembling Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the U.S.<br />
<br />
<strong>Happy days</strong><br />
Now on to the specifics. For the first time, the new laws will help create and register real estate mortgages. Lenders will be able to take on foreclosures, unlike the limited legal reprieve available earlier. Better documentation will help clear title deeds, which will help the long-term development of the real estate market. More real estate finance companies will be attracted to the market. A regulated market will induce the development of a secondary market through refinancing, and gradually introduce mortgage based securities in the Kingdom. Finally, the emergence of a long-term Sukuk market will infuse more liquidity into the market and create a long-term yield curve, which is currently non-existent.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The principal stakeholders will not be left behind. An entirely new business opportunity will open up for banks. For real estate developers, it will mean more liquidity and hence lowered turnaround time for construction. For investors, there will be clarity on the property market as more real estate data is made public. The listing of real estate finance companies will ensure better transparency and disclosures. A regulatory mechanism comparable with the best in the world would evolve. This will rid the government of inefficient subsidies and disbursal mechanisms. The consumers will benefit from increased supply that will meet rising demand. The best part: those earning a salary of SAR 25,000 onwards will be able to afford Villas!<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Long road to walk</strong><br />
Hold on. The picture is not entirely rosy yet! The new law does not incentivize landowners or developers to utilize the undeveloped land (according to press reports, the Saudi cabinet recently approved a proposal to tax undeveloped land in urban areas). The absence of a clear legal framework, especially related to foreclosure, has led to restricted lending. Mortgage penetration rates (mortgage debt as a percentage of GDP) in Saudi Arabia are low at 2%, compared to 5-10% in the neighboring GCC countries. In contrast, developed countries like the US and UK, have mortgage penetration rates of more than 70%.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The law does not explicitly say that mortgage or finance companies will have the right to foreclose by taking outright ownership of the property in case the applicant becomes insolvent.&nbsp; Under the Shariah law, judgments given by the judges do not set a binding precedent, due to which cases of similar defaults in mortgage payments could result in entirely different verdicts. There are no taxes on real estate transactions in Saudi Arabia except when it is held for speculative purposes.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Additionally, no pricing statistics of properties are available publicly. We have to see whether the new regulations will bring about any changes to control speculation.&nbsp; There is no guarantee of standardization of pricing of mortgage products, as no long-term yield curve exists. Also, the health of the borrower is an important lending criterion. It is impossible to evict the dependents of a borrower, in case of his death, where usually the debt is waived off.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Outlook</strong><br />
The new law represents the first baby step in the right direction, which will benefit the Saudi real estate sector over the long-term. SAMA and the Saudi government should proactively remove gray issues to ensure the success of the new law.<br />

		<Title>[:en]China and Middle East: Bountiful Partnership[:ar]الصين والشرق الأوسط: شراكة وافرة[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]China and Middle East have had long historical trade linkages that have only grown closer and more prominent with time. At present, the relationship has gone beyond just transfer of goods and services, to transfer of knowledge and expertise. With the Middle East facing the brunt of low oil price and attempting to diversify their revenues, and China undergoing an economic transition, we shine a light at this symbiotic relationship, as the countries attempt to help each other achieve their long term goals.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Trends</strong><br />
Trade links between China and the Middle East has been growing in double digits over the past decade, with nearly three-quarters of its oil imports to China coming from the Middle East. Chinese trade with Saudi Arabia, the region&rsquo;s biggest economy, has risen 10-fold since 2003, so much so that Saudi has now replaced the US as China&rsquo;s single most important trading partner. Import value of goods from Middle East has risen at over 20% per year, with crude and refined petroleum forming the major part. MENA-China trade has increased to nearly USD 300bn in 2013, 50-fold in the past 20 years. For most Middle East countries China is topmost trading partner.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, Chinese exports to the Middle East primarily comprise of low-cost household goods, such as affordable cars in Egypt, and cheap Chinese goods sold in strife affected regions in the Middle East. Overall Gulf demand for Chinese manufactured goods is comparatively weak. Presently, China&rsquo;s growth story is witnessing a minor slowdown, but trade with Middle East remains a priority for the world&rsquo;s largest energy consumer, as the country has an insatiable appetite for commodities. China accounts for almost 20% of the world&rsquo;s total energy consumption, the largest in the world, and according to IEA, China&rsquo;s crude oil imports from the Middle East will reach 70% (from the present 51%) by 2020, and continue to grow until 2035.<br />
<br />
<strong>Capital flows</strong><br />
Although China&rsquo;s focus in the region is in the hydrocarbon sector, it has moved beyond energy and commodities into other sectors such as urban and transport infrastructure. Chinese investments in Saudi Arabia focus on metals, energy, real estate, and transportation. New business registrations by Chinese companies have grown rapidly in the UAE, and Chinese banks are setting up in Dubai and Abu Dhabi to administer capital flows associated with that trade. Trade between China-UAE is expected to rise to nearly USD 100bn by 2015, and renminbi would soon trade officially in the region.<br />
<br />
Following the success of the Mecca monorail project, China and Iran entered an agreement to build a railway line from Tehran to the Iraqi border, as a part of an overall plan to link the Middle East to China through Central Asia. Governments in the Middle East have brought Chinese contractors to work on major infrastructure projects in the region, such as the Egypt-China partnership to develop the Suez SEZ.<br />
<br />
<strong>Middle East interests in China</strong><br />
Gulf investment in China is witnessed mostly in financial, hospitality, textile, agriculture, logistics and aviation sectors, with three noticeable trends: diversified investment, concentration in the service sector and movement to second-tier cities. While it is difficult to obtain official statistics on Gulf investment in China, media reports show that these activities are growing.<br />
<br />
Prominent Gulf Sovereign Wealth Funds (ADIA, KIA and QH) have obtained approval from the Chinese authorities to enter China&rsquo;s bonds and securities market, and have bought large stakes in major Chinese IPOs, especially in the banking sector. Dubai-based luxury hotel group, Jumeirah, plans to construct luxury hotels in Guangzhou, Hainan, Zhejiang provinces and Macau, while Saudi private investment firm, Ajlan and Brothers Co., has invested USD 632mn in 20 textile factories, in synthetic fabrics, cotton textiles, shoes and accessories. Al Futtaim, the Dubai-based supermarket operator, has tie-ups with a Singapore company to invest in China&rsquo;s agricultural sector. Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways have launched routes to second-tier cities, such as Chengdu.<br />
<br />
China has also courted Saudi investment for expanding its refining capacity, with the possible partnership of China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation&rsquo;s (SINOPEC) with Saudi Aramco in the USD 1.2bn Qingdao refinery, added to their existing USD 3.5bn joint venture in Fujian province. Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) signed MoUs with Chengdu Financial City Investment and Development, an emerging financial center in the southwest of China, in addition to its MoU with Shanghai&rsquo;s Pudong Financial Services Bureau. Dubai-based sports (horseracing, golf and tennis) and leisure developer, Meydan Group, announced a strategic partnership with Chengdu in 2013, following which the first Chengdu-Dubai International Cup was held in April 2014.<br />
This shows that Gulf investors have begun to shift from simple investment to management skills transfer in their areas of expertise.<br />
<br />
<strong>China&rsquo;s transition</strong><br />
The low oil price has only accelerated the trade between China and the Middle East, as the volume of oil and petrochemical trade has increased since the decline. China eagerly shored up its stocks of the commodity, which works well for the OPEC nations, as they are keen on increasing their market share, rather than control supply to regulate prices. But low oil price has played a role in reducing inflation across the globe, which has made the costs of goods and services cheaper, thereby impacting competitiveness of Chinese products in global markets. As for China&rsquo;s attempts to move to a domestic consumption led model, it remains to be seen on how this structural change affects trade flow. While the imports are expected to grow at current pace, Chinese exports may either remain the same or drop depending on how fast domestic consumption increases.<br />
<br />
<strong>Internationalization of the RMB</strong><br />
Chinese currency, renminbi, enjoys a rising acceptance in banks and enterprises in the Gulf region, and there is a growing demand for conducting trade with the currency. The UAE is the biggest export market for Chinese goods in the region, and leading local and foreign banks, such as Emirates NBD and HSBC, have recently started to expand their product portfolio to provide accounts or trade financing in the Chinese currency. Many believe that cross-border renminbi settlement is expected to account for 20% to 30% in the next five years. China&#39;s ambitious trans-Eurasia and across-ocean trade strategy, launched in 2014, will also push the internationalization of the global renminbi trade.<br />
<br />
Dubai has expressed interest in establishing an offshore RMB center in the Gulf region, with talks held in the last quarter of 2014 between DIFC and the People&rsquo;s Bank of China to set up a renminbi offshore market to tap into enhanced trade and investments flows. Aside the high level interest to use China&rsquo;s renminbi as a currency for trade, investments and reserve currency, it would leverage on the presence of four large Chinese banks, and provide an option for businesses.<br />
<br />
It is clear that despite the current economic environment, China and Middle East have forged a lasting relationship that will serve both parties well. Leveraging on Chinese expertise in infrastructure development, Middle East countries seek to develop their non-oil economies rapidly, while selling more oil to the world&rsquo;s biggest consumer. On the other hand China wishes to improve sectors, such as hydrocarbon and tourism, and has sought assistance from its trading partners. With increase in trade and cross border capital flows, this may develop into a defining and mutually beneficial relationship, bridging east and west Asia.<br />

Following the success of the Mecca monorail project, China and Iran entered an agreement to build a railway line from Tehran to the Iraqi border, as a part of an overall plan to link the Middle East to China through Central Asia. Governments in the Middle East have brought Chinese contractors to work on major infrastructure projects in the region, such as the Egypt-China partnership to develop the Suez SEZ.<br />
<br />
<strong>Middle East interests in China</strong><br />
Gulf investment in China is witnessed mostly in financial, hospitality, textile, agriculture, logistics and aviation sectors, with three noticeable trends: diversified investment, concentration in the service sector and movement to second-tier cities. While it is difficult to obtain official statistics on Gulf investment in China, media reports show that these activities are growing.<br />
<br />
Prominent Gulf Sovereign Wealth Funds (ADIA, KIA and QH) have obtained approval from the Chinese authorities to enter China&rsquo;s bonds and securities market, and have bought large stakes in major Chinese IPOs, especially in the banking sector. Dubai-based luxury hotel group, Jumeirah, plans to construct luxury hotels in Guangzhou, Hainan, Zhejiang provinces and Macau, while Saudi private investment firm, Ajlan and Brothers Co., has invested USD 632mn in 20 textile factories, in synthetic fabrics, cotton textiles, shoes and accessories. Al Futtaim, the Dubai-based supermarket operator, has tie-ups with a Singapore company to invest in China&rsquo;s agricultural sector. Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways have launched routes to second-tier cities, such as Chengdu.<br />
<br />
China has also courted Saudi investment for expanding its refining capacity, with the possible partnership of China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation&rsquo;s (SINOPEC) with Saudi Aramco in the USD 1.2bn Qingdao refinery, added to their existing USD 3.5bn joint venture in Fujian province. Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) signed MoUs with Chengdu Financial City Investment and Development, an emerging financial center in the southwest of China, in addition to its MoU with Shanghai&rsquo;s Pudong Financial Services Bureau. Dubai-based sports (horseracing, golf and tennis) and leisure developer, Meydan Group, announced a strategic partnership with Chengdu in 2013, following which the first Chengdu-Dubai International Cup was held in April 2014.<br />
This shows that Gulf investors have begun to shift from simple investment to management skills transfer in their areas of expertise.<br />
<br />
<strong>China&rsquo;s transition</strong><br />
The low oil price has only accelerated the trade between China and the Middle East, as the volume of oil and petrochemical trade has increased since the decline. China eagerly shored up its stocks of the commodity, which works well for the OPEC nations, as they are keen on increasing their market share, rather than control supply to regulate prices. But low oil price has played a role in reducing inflation across the globe, which has made the costs of goods and services cheaper, thereby impacting competitiveness of Chinese products in global markets. As for China&rsquo;s attempts to move to a domestic consumption led model, it remains to be seen on how this structural change affects trade flow. While the imports are expected to grow at current pace, Chinese exports may either remain the same or drop depending on how fast domestic consumption increases.<br />
<br />
<strong>Internationalization of the RMB</strong><br />
Chinese currency, renminbi, enjoys a rising acceptance in banks and enterprises in the Gulf region, and there is a growing demand for conducting trade with the currency. The UAE is the biggest export market for Chinese goods in the region, and leading local and foreign banks, such as Emirates NBD and HSBC, have recently started to expand their product portfolio to provide accounts or trade financing in the Chinese currency. Many believe that cross-border renminbi settlement is expected to account for 20% to 30% in the next five years. China&#39;s ambitious trans-Eurasia and across-ocean trade strategy, launched in 2014, will also push the internationalization of the global renminbi trade.<br />
<br />
Dubai has expressed interest in establishing an offshore RMB center in the Gulf region, with talks held in the last quarter of 2014 between DIFC and the People&rsquo;s Bank of China to set up a renminbi offshore market to tap into enhanced trade and investments flows. Aside the high level interest to use China&rsquo;s renminbi as a currency for trade, investments and reserve currency, it would leverage on the presence of four large Chinese banks, and provide an option for businesses.<br />
<br />
It is clear that despite the current economic environment, China and Middle East have forged a lasting relationship that will serve both parties well. Leveraging on Chinese expertise in infrastructure development, Middle East countries seek to develop their non-oil economies rapidly, while selling more oil to the world&rsquo;s biggest consumer. On the other hand China wishes to improve sectors, such as hydrocarbon and tourism, and has sought assistance from its trading partners. With increase in trade and cross border capital flows, this may develop into a defining and mutually beneficial relationship, bridging east and west Asia.<br />

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<strong>Connecting Minds, Creating the Future </strong><br />
<br />
In 2020, the UAE will host the World Expo, which is held once every five years for the duration of 3-6 months. The history of expo dates back to 1851, when &lsquo;The Great Exhibition&rsquo; was first held in London. Since then, different regions of the world have hosted it at regular intervals, but this would be the first time the event is being hosted in the MENA region.<br />
<br />
Themes for the expos are usually broad, and cover issues related to humanity. For example, the theme for the Milan Expo that is to be held in 2015 is &ldquo;Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life&rdquo;, and the expo held in Shanghai in 2010 was based on the theme "Better City &ndash; Better Life". Keeping in line with the tradition, the Expo 2020 has a universal theme of &ldquo;Connecting Minds, Creating the Future&rdquo;, which covers three subthemes: Sustainability, Mobility and Opportunity. &lsquo;Sustainability&rsquo; encompasses solutions for lasting sources of energy and water, &lsquo;Mobility&rsquo; augments smart systems of logistics and transportation, and &lsquo;Opportunity&rsquo; explores new paths to economic development. As explained in the official website of the Expo 2020:<br />
<em>The focus will be on exploring their interdependencies, and identifying potential partnerships, ultimately resulting in a legacy of innovation.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>Economic Impact: Jobs & Growth</strong><br />
<br />
The World Expo is a mega event, and is estimated to attract up to 25 million visitors over the course of the event, of which 70 per cent will be from outside the UAE . In economic terms, it is expected to generate Dh 90billion or 18billion euros , and create over 277,000 jobs, over the period 2013-21 , 90% of which would occur during 2018-21 . The expo, therefore, would increase the current workforce of 1.3million by 20 per cent , and have a direct impact on the growth of sectors such as construction, real estate, travel and tourism, hospitality, and retail, over the next seven years.<br />
<br />
<strong>Travel and Tourism sector will generate the most job opportunities&nbsp;</strong><br />
<br />
Dubai is strategically located within four hours of a third of the world&rsquo;s population, and with the estimated 25 million visitors coming to the Expo, it would set a record for the largest number of footfalls, in the history of the World Expo. The airlines industry will see heavy traffic, and additional arrangements will have to be made to handle the large number visitors. Once the visitors reach Dubai, there will be a wide range of tourism opportunities, such as world-class museums within the Saadiyat Island Cultural District, luxury resorts on Saadiyat Beach, and entertainment at Yas Island.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The Tour and Travel operators expect to have huge surge in sales, and are planning for road shows, more branches, and extended services. To add to this, there are preparations for creating various other attractions in the city, such as a crocodile park in Dubai&rsquo;s outskirts, a zoo and safari park, spread over 119 hectares, and traditional souks in Deira. Other plans include a Dubai Wetland Centre, near the Ras Al Khor flamingo sanctuary, a miniature park containing local icons, such as Burj Khalifa and Burj Al Arab, and a palm park with 5,000 species of palms as an educational botanical area . The Travel and Tourism sector is estimated to generate 40 per cent of the total projected jobs during 2013-21, and 59 per cent of the newly created jobs during the ramp up to Expo 2020, in the final 3 years. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Hospitality receives a major boost</strong><br />
<br />
Hotel occupancies in Dubai are regularly above 80 per cent, and to accommodate the large number of Expo visitors, it is estimated that 50,000 more rooms, from budget to luxury, would be required . According to Euromonitor International, the hotel inventory is expected to double, from over 82,000 in 2013 to around 164,000 rooms by 2020, and tourism receipts are projected to increase by 67 per cent, by 2018, with the MICE (Meetings, incentives, conferencing, exhibitions) industry contributing most to this increase. However, there is a risk of oversupply of hotel rooms, if the forecasted visitor footfalls do not materialize, or also if the tourist arrivals drops down after the end of Expo.<br />
<br />
<strong>Infrastructure projects worth USD 6.9bn earmarked for the Expo 2020</strong><br />
<br />
The venue for the Expo is spread over 438 hectares on the southwestern edge of Dubai, and to ensure connectivity, the government has planned to fast-track the Dh 5billion Dubai Metro Red line expansion , from the existing terminus at Jebel Ali to Al Maktoum International Airport. According to Mattar Al Tayer, Chairman of the Road and Transport Authority, the expansion will be the only major investment for transport planned for the expo, and will take three to four years.<br />
<br />
GCC banks and financial institutions will play a key role in financing the projects, and Shariah compliant financing is expected to receive a major boost in the run-up to the event. Free zones, like the one at Jebel Ali near the Expo 2020 venue, offer foreign investors benefits such as 100 per cent foreign ownership, guaranteed tax free status, hassle free support services, such as licensing and visa sponsorship procedures, and updated tech facilities . This would serve both to attract foreign investment, and to promote the Expo worldwide, and would have wide ranging effects for the Dubai economy.<br />
<br />
<strong>Retail sector set to expand</strong><br />
<br />
With large number of visitors inbound for the duration of six months, the retail industry will see surge in consumer traffic and sales. Dubai Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing (DTCM) expects the number of tourist arrivals to double the 10million tourist arrivals in 2012 , which would enhance sales in the retail sector. In 2013, the number of tourist arrivals to Dubai went up to over 11million. According to David Macadam, CEO and Vice Chairman of the Middle East Council of Shopping Centers, mall space in Dubai needs to be doubled to accommodate the increased tourism. He also believes that the expo will help them reach new heights in retail sector, and with addition of new retail space, Dubai will have more international brands than any other location in the world.<br />
<br />
<strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
<br />
The World Expo 2020 will attract many global players, and will raise service standards through competition and adoption of best practices, across various sectors. A survey conducted by &lsquo;Insight Discovery&rsquo; has reported that the general outlook of the UAE residents towards the expo is positive , with close to 60 per cent expressing strong interest. 88 per cent of the respondents believed that the event will impact their lives positively; however, 91 per cent strongly believe that the expo will cause the general cost of living to rise.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The Expo is a wonderful platform for the UAE and the GCC countries to showcase their potential, and fast track the development in the region. However, there must be some amount of caution exercised in investments and expansion, so as to avoid redundancy and creating bubble-like situation, which may put the economy again on back foot.[:ar]<strong>Connecting Minds, Creating the Future </strong><br />

		<Title>[:en]Gulf Business: The Top 100 Companies in the GCC[:ar]شركات دول مجلس التعاون الخليجي: أفضل 100 شركة في دول مجلس التعاون الخليجي[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]GCC markets saw a strong rally in the first half of 2014, with almost all major GCC indices ending in green. The S&P GCC index was up by 8.2% in 1H14, compared to the preceding full-year performance of 25%. Expansive fiscal and accommodative monetary policies, along with sustained oil prices at over USD 100, carried the momentum forward from 2013. The highlights for the first half of this year are the upgrade to emerging status accorded to U.A.E and Qatar markets, Saudi’s capital market authority announcing that Tadawul would be opened up to foreign institutional investors by 2015, and a record number and value of IPOs since 2008.

The year 2013 was sombre for global economies, as growth remained weak and fragile. In the US, low interest rates, along with a recovery in the real estate sector, accelerated growth despite fiscal tightening. Regardless of tapering down of asset purchase in the US, slowdown in the emerging markets moderated, as consumption compensated for falling investments. Eurozone trudged along, with tight credit conditions, austerity measures, and high unemployment rates dampening its progress.

Despite incessant geopolitical tensions in the region that continues to fuel uncertainty, 2013 was a splendid year for the GCC countries, as substantial fiscal surpluses, coupled with increased state spending ensured healthy growth rates. While oil GDP growth remained stagnant in the GCC, non-oil GDP growth was supported by large scale government spending. Kuwait lagged behind the rest of its peers, as political gridlock led to tepid growth in non-oil sectors. This, along with a 2% contraction in oil sector, caused economic activity in the country to grow by a meagre 0.8%.

In the first half of 2014, persistently high oil prices in the global markets, buoyed their GCC counterparts. Although hydrocarbon sector contribution to the GDP had steadily declined to 33%, it still constitutes 84% of total government revenues . The member countries, however, continued to invest heavily in non-hydrocarbon sectors, in a bid to diversify their economies. Despite various geopolitical issues in the region, GCC remains a safe haven, with their governments actively pursuing various policy initiatives, to diversify their growth engines, and improve competitiveness of their economies, albeit in varying degrees.

The year began with feverish anticipation of the MSCI upgrade of UAE and Qatar that was announced mid of 2013. The markets of both countries were on a steady climb since the announcement, with Dubai and Abu Dhabi exchanges posting a 108% and 63% climb in 2013, and Qatar registering a 24% increase during the same period. The indices carried forward the momentum into 2014, with Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Qatar recording a 50%, 19% and 31% increase in index value (till end of August 2014), respectively. Large infrastructure spending building up to the Expo 2020 and the 2022 FIFA World Cup propelled the banking, real estate and construction sectors.

Qatar index breached its ceiling multiple times by the end of August, with the upgrade to MSCI Emerging market index, subsequent rise in the proportion of Qatari companies in the index, and increase in foreign ownership limit from 25% to 49% driving the index to new highs. Qatar stock exchange witnessed a net foreign portfolio investment inflow of USD 1.9bn, in the first five months of 2014. Both the UAE and Qatar markets declined in the month after the upgrade took effect, however, positive Q2 results and passive fund flows lifted activity at both Qatar and UAE exchanges, and they seem primed to close the year on an optimistic note, yet again. Performance of Kuwait and Oman indicies lagged behind the rest of their peers,as Kuwait weighted and price index recorded a YTD-August performance of 9% and -1.6%, while Oman registered an 8% increase.

As part of ongoing economic reforms, Saudi Arabia’s Capital Market Authority (CMA) announced in July, plans to open up the stock market for direct investment by foreign institutions in the first half of 2015. The announcement led to the TASI index breaching the psychological 10,000-point barrier for the first time since 2007. While the opening up will happen in a phased manner, the markets are set to attract inflows worth USD 35bn, which the government hopes will help boost diversification efforts, as the country seeks to generate more non-oil sector growth . This move is expected to further increase the efficiency of the market, as companies will adhere to stricter corporate disclosure requirements in order to attract foreign funds. The news has already attracted the attention of large foreign institutions, such as Morgan Stanley, Standard Chartered PLC, Bank of America Corp, Credit Suisse, HSBC and JPMorgan, as many are waiting in the wings for the largest and relatively well-regulated GCC market to allow outside investors. By the end of August, the TASI index had climbed 30%, and closed on a six year high of 11,112 points.

Overall, 1H14 turned out to be quite positve for GCC indices, with four of six country indices recording double digit growth. Dubai (DFMGI) was the largest gainer (50.2%, YTD- August), followed by Qatar (31%) and Saudi Arabia (30.2%). MENA IPO market raised USD 2.4bn from 16 IPOs, in the first half of 2014, compared to 12 IPOs worth USD 2.1bn in the equivalent period in 2013. GCC countries had the largest share of IPO listings in MENA, accounting for 90 percent of the capital raised through IPOs in MENA, with 10 IPOs raising nearly USD 2.2billion. Saudi Arabia was the prime issuer in terms of number of issues and capital raised, with four IPOs worth USD 533.3mn, including the much anticipated listings of Abdul Mohsen AlHokair Group (USD 220mn) and Al-Hammadi Company (USD 168mn). The largest deal in H1, 2014 was by Mesaieed Petrochemical Holding Company, Qatar’s first IPO since 2010, which brought in USD 0.9billion, and accounted for 38% of the capital raised in the period.

Overall GCC market liquidity level surged to USD 414bn in the first half of 2014, an increase of 56% over the equivalent period from previous year. The increase was led by UAE markets, where value traded grew to USD 99bn surpassing the value traded for whole year in 2013 by 49%. UAE (291%) and Qatar (188%) had notable increase in liquidity levels in the first half of the year compared to the previous year value for the same period, attributable to trading activity that occurred in anticipation of the MSCI inclusion. Saudi Arabia (34%) and Oman (32%) witnessed YoY growth in value traded in the first half of the year, while Bahrain (-14%) and Kuwait (-57%) saw slumps.

<b>The Road Ahead:</b> Following the successful upgrade of UAE and Qatar markets into the MSCI Emerging Market Index, Saudi Arabia is vying for a similar upgrade. The announcement to allow foreign investor participation, albeit in a regulated manner, is seen as the first step in a bid to ramp up market reforms. For UAE, the preparations to host the World Expo 2020 should keep the non-oil growth ticking, while Qatar has several on-going projects in roads, ports, rail, metro, real estate developments and a new central business district in Lusail, as part of its infrastructure build-up to the World Cup (although there are recent talks that Qatar might lose its rights to host the World Cup owing to the weather). In Kuwait, the ensuing political stability has increased optimism for a revival in investment cycle. In the coming months, for various infrastructure projects, as envisioned in the development plan, the contracts are set to be awarded.

Although Fed’s QE policy will have tapered down by the end of this year, the question of when the interest rates would be hiked has not yet been properly addressed. After the recent FOMC meeting, speculation inthe market is rife that hikes in interest rates may occur either during the first or second quarter of 2015. Its effect on global markets, including the GCC, is a cause for concern. Oil markets have been relatively stable, despite regional tensions in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Egypt etc., due to the shale boom in the US, which has reduced supply pressures. However, fluctuating oil prices would impact government spending, and will have a spillover effect on other sectors in the GCC region. On the other hand normalizing conditions in the Middle East may lead to a fall in oil prices that would shrink the fiscal surpluses of GCC countries. Rising asset values and inflation are other worrying factors, affecting UAE and Qatar markets, in particular.

<b>Saudi Arabia- Diversification and market reforms</b>
Real GDP of Saudi Arabia is expected to continue its growth at a stable rate in 2014 and 2015, underpinned by robust non-hydrocarbon activity. IIF estimates non-hydrocarbon GDP to grow at about 5% in 2014, supported by the execution of large projects. Riyadh has several ongoing construction activities including housing projects, a new financial center, an additional airport terminal and a metro. Saudi Arabia is expected to announce its 2015-19 development plan in the coming months. New sectors such as automotives are expected to receive government support which, in turn, are expected to nourish ancillary activity across related sectors. Strong non-oil growth should receive additional support from recent labor market reforms, which had the effect of reducing unemployment. In terms of value traded, Saudi Arabia witnessed a 30% drop in 2013, from 2012 value of USD 512bn, but bounced back with a 34% increase in 1H14 (USD 270bn) over 1H13. Continuing credit growth and introduction of the new mortgage law will spur activity in both banking and real estate sectors.

<b>Kuwait – Stalled development plans revitalized</b>
IMF estimates real GDP of Kuwait to rebound to 2.6% in 2014 and 3.0% in 2015 after a slowdown 2013. In the near term, hydrocarbon sector growth is expected to be flat due to a rise in oil supply globally, on account of easing of sanctions imposed earlier on Iran, and continued growth in supply from US. The non-oil sector is expected to drive growth in Kuwait. The recently announced second five-year development will continue to foucs on infrastructure. Kuwait also enacted new legislations to ease impediments and attract foreign direct investments. The ensuing political stability in Kuwait has renewed expectations on implementing the much needed structural reforms to revive the investment cycle. Materialization of Kuwait development plan by way of tendering project contracts and execution of the same is expected. In terms of value traded, Kuwait posted a 40% increase in 2013, from 2012 value of USD 26bn, but fell 57% in 1H14 (USD 11bn) over 1H13.

<b>The UAE- Winding down after the party</b>
According to IIF estimates, tourism, transportation, and trade will boost non-hydrocarbon growth to 5.2% in 2014, but real GDP growth will be moderate in the coming years due to declining contribution of hydrocarbon sector. Aggregate corporate earning in UAE came in at USD 8bn in 1H14, implying a YoY growth of 16%. Value traded in the first half of the year was close to four times the value for the equivalent period last year, due to upgrade to the MSCI EM index and the stellar performance of banks and real estate. But the heady optimism might be waning, as the valuations no longer appear attractive. The Arabtec fiasco in June has also raised serious questions about corporate governance and the role of regulators in ensuring a fair, efficient and transparent market in UAE. Preparations for the Expo 2020 and investments in infrastructure and real estate, should ensure continued growth in the Emirates.

<b>Qatar- Robust non-hydrocarbon growth</b>
Qatar is estimated to post strong real GDP growth rates of 5.9% in 2014 and 7.1% in 2015. Stagnation in hydrocarbon growth has led to decline in real growth to single digit. But gas production targets in Qatar have largely been met, and there are no current plans for a further increase after the Barzan project comes on-stream in 2014/2015. Non-hydrocarbon growth on the other hand is expected to be robust. Share of non-hydrocarbon sector in GDP (nominal terms) is expected to rise from 46% in 2013 to 50% in 2014 as the economy gets more diversified. Infrastructure expenditure in Qatar between 2014-2018 (excluding oil and gas) is expected to be at QAR 664bn (USD 182bn, or about 90% of 2013 GDP). In terms of value traded, Qatar recorded a 34% increase in 2013, from 2012 value of USD 16bn, and followed it up with an impressive 188% increase in 1H14 (USD 28bn) over 1H13 value of USD 10bn, as a result of the MSCI upgrade.

<b>Sector Focus</b>
<b>Banking and Financial Services Sector:</b> With increase in non-hydrocarbon growth, improving economic prospects and tremendous increase in asset values, there has been a surge in lending across the region, in the first half of the year. Financial services gained the most during 1H14, a total earnings growth of 35% on a YoY basis, whereas, banking firms had recorded a YoY growth of 6% in the first half of 2014. GCC loans and deposts are expected to grow by 11% respectively in 2014, maintaining a loan-to-deposit ratio of 86%, while loan loss provisions and NPA are witnessing a declining trend, which is expected to continue this year. Large government spending on infrastructure across GCC and continuing credit growth augurs well for the sector.

<b>Construction: </b>Recovery of real estate and large government spending in infrastructure across GCC over the next few years, will lead to increase in demand for construction and related materials. The total worth of planned and un-awarded construction projects exceeds USD 1.09 trillion, roughly two-thirds of the GCC’s entire annual GDP . Kuwait’s new development plan for 2015-20 outlines construction of the USD 20bn metro and USd 8bn rail project, which the GCC railway project. Qatar and UAE are expanding their metro, rail and road networks in preparation for their respective key events. Saudi Arabia has embarked on a social infrastructure drive, with 742 new schools and 40 colleges under construction, and 17 new hospitals being built. Youthful, growing population, influx of expatriate labor, focus on middle and lower income housing groups, and relaxation of rules allowing foreign ownership of real estate, will lead to increased activity in the sector over the next half decade.

&nbsp;[:ar]GCC markets saw a strong rally in the first half of 2014, with almost all major GCC indices ending in green. The S&P GCC index was up by 8.2% in 1H14, compared to the preceding full-year performance of 25%. Expansive fiscal and accommodative monetary policies, along with sustained oil prices at over USD 100, carried the momentum forward from 2013. The highlights for the first half of this year are the upgrade to emerging status accorded to U.A.E and Qatar markets, Saudi’s capital market authority announcing that Tadawul would be opened up to foreign institutional investors by 2015, and a record number and value of IPOs since 2008.

The year 2013 was sombre for global economies, as growth remained weak and fragile. In the US, low interest rates, along with a recovery in the real estate sector, accelerated growth despite fiscal tightening. Regardless of tapering down of asset purchase in the US, slowdown in the emerging markets moderated, as consumption compensated for falling investments. Eurozone trudged along, with tight credit conditions, austerity measures, and high unemployment rates dampening its progress.

Despite incessant geopolitical tensions in the region that continues to fuel uncertainty, 2013 was a splendid year for the GCC countries, as substantial fiscal surpluses, coupled with increased state spending ensured healthy growth rates. While oil GDP growth remained stagnant in the GCC, non-oil GDP growth was supported by large scale government spending. Kuwait lagged behind the rest of its peers, as political gridlock led to tepid growth in non-oil sectors. This, along with a 2% contraction in oil sector, caused economic activity in the country to grow by a meagre 0.8%.

In the first half of 2014, persistently high oil prices in the global markets, buoyed their GCC counterparts. Although hydrocarbon sector contribution to the GDP had steadily declined to 33%, it still constitutes 84% of total government revenues . The member countries, however, continued to invest heavily in non-hydrocarbon sectors, in a bid to diversify their economies. Despite various geopolitical issues in the region, GCC remains a safe haven, with their governments actively pursuing various policy initiatives, to diversify their growth engines, and improve competitiveness of their economies, albeit in varying degrees.

The year began with feverish anticipation of the MSCI upgrade of UAE and Qatar that was announced mid of 2013. The markets of both countries were on a steady climb since the announcement, with Dubai and Abu Dhabi exchanges posting a 108% and 63% climb in 2013, and Qatar registering a 24% increase during the same period. The indices carried forward the momentum into 2014, with Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Qatar recording a 50%, 19% and 31% increase in index value (till end of August 2014), respectively. Large infrastructure spending building up to the Expo 2020 and the 2022 FIFA World Cup propelled the banking, real estate and construction sectors.

Qatar index breached its ceiling multiple times by the end of August, with the upgrade to MSCI Emerging market index, subsequent rise in the proportion of Qatari companies in the index, and increase in foreign ownership limit from 25% to 49% driving the index to new highs. Qatar stock exchange witnessed a net foreign portfolio investment inflow of USD 1.9bn, in the first five months of 2014. Both the UAE and Qatar markets declined in the month after the upgrade took effect, however, positive Q2 results and passive fund flows lifted activity at both Qatar and UAE exchanges, and they seem primed to close the year on an optimistic note, yet again. Performance of Kuwait and Oman indicies lagged behind the rest of their peers,as Kuwait weighted and price index recorded a YTD-August performance of 9% and -1.6%, while Oman registered an 8% increase.

As part of ongoing economic reforms, Saudi Arabia’s Capital Market Authority (CMA) announced in July, plans to open up the stock market for direct investment by foreign institutions in the first half of 2015. The announcement led to the TASI index breaching the psychological 10,000-point barrier for the first time since 2007. While the opening up will happen in a phased manner, the markets are set to attract inflows worth USD 35bn, which the government hopes will help boost diversification efforts, as the country seeks to generate more non-oil sector growth . This move is expected to further increase the efficiency of the market, as companies will adhere to stricter corporate disclosure requirements in order to attract foreign funds. The news has already attracted the attention of large foreign institutions, such as Morgan Stanley, Standard Chartered PLC, Bank of America Corp, Credit Suisse, HSBC and JPMorgan, as many are waiting in the wings for the largest and relatively well-regulated GCC market to allow outside investors. By the end of August, the TASI index had climbed 30%, and closed on a six year high of 11,112 points.

Overall, 1H14 turned out to be quite positve for GCC indices, with four of six country indices recording double digit growth. Dubai (DFMGI) was the largest gainer (50.2%, YTD- August), followed by Qatar (31%) and Saudi Arabia (30.2%). MENA IPO market raised USD 2.4bn from 16 IPOs, in the first half of 2014, compared to 12 IPOs worth USD 2.1bn in the equivalent period in 2013. GCC countries had the largest share of IPO listings in MENA, accounting for 90 percent of the capital raised through IPOs in MENA, with 10 IPOs raising nearly USD 2.2billion. Saudi Arabia was the prime issuer in terms of number of issues and capital raised, with four IPOs worth USD 533.3mn, including the much anticipated listings of Abdul Mohsen AlHokair Group (USD 220mn) and Al-Hammadi Company (USD 168mn). The largest deal in H1, 2014 was by Mesaieed Petrochemical Holding Company, Qatar’s first IPO since 2010, which brought in USD 0.9billion, and accounted for 38% of the capital raised in the period.

Overall GCC market liquidity level surged to USD 414bn in the first half of 2014, an increase of 56% over the equivalent period from previous year. The increase was led by UAE markets, where value traded grew to USD 99bn surpassing the value traded for whole year in 2013 by 49%. UAE (291%) and Qatar (188%) had notable increase in liquidity levels in the first half of the year compared to the previous year value for the same period, attributable to trading activity that occurred in anticipation of the MSCI inclusion. Saudi Arabia (34%) and Oman (32%) witnessed YoY growth in value traded in the first half of the year, while Bahrain (-14%) and Kuwait (-57%) saw slumps.

<b>The Road Ahead:</b> Following the successful upgrade of UAE and Qatar markets into the MSCI Emerging Market Index, Saudi Arabia is vying for a similar upgrade. The announcement to allow foreign investor participation, albeit in a regulated manner, is seen as the first step in a bid to ramp up market reforms. For UAE, the preparations to host the World Expo 2020 should keep the non-oil growth ticking, while Qatar has several on-going projects in roads, ports, rail, metro, real estate developments and a new central business district in Lusail, as part of its infrastructure build-up to the World Cup (although there are recent talks that Qatar might lose its rights to host the World Cup owing to the weather). In Kuwait, the ensuing political stability has increased optimism for a revival in investment cycle. In the coming months, for various infrastructure projects, as envisioned in the development plan, the contracts are set to be awarded.

Although Fed’s QE policy will have tapered down by the end of this year, the question of when the interest rates would be hiked has not yet been properly addressed. After the recent FOMC meeting, speculation inthe market is rife that hikes in interest rates may occur either during the first or second quarter of 2015. Its effect on global markets, including the GCC, is a cause for concern. Oil markets have been relatively stable, despite regional tensions in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Egypt etc., due to the shale boom in the US, which has reduced supply pressures. However, fluctuating oil prices would impact government spending, and will have a spillover effect on other sectors in the GCC region. On the other hand normalizing conditions in the Middle East may lead to a fall in oil prices that would shrink the fiscal surpluses of GCC countries. Rising asset values and inflation are other worrying factors, affecting UAE and Qatar markets, in particular.

<b>Saudi Arabia- Diversification and market reforms</b>
Real GDP of Saudi Arabia is expected to continue its growth at a stable rate in 2014 and 2015, underpinned by robust non-hydrocarbon activity. IIF estimates non-hydrocarbon GDP to grow at about 5% in 2014, supported by the execution of large projects. Riyadh has several ongoing construction activities including housing projects, a new financial center, an additional airport terminal and a metro. Saudi Arabia is expected to announce its 2015-19 development plan in the coming months. New sectors such as automotives are expected to receive government support which, in turn, are expected to nourish ancillary activity across related sectors. Strong non-oil growth should receive additional support from recent labor market reforms, which had the effect of reducing unemployment. In terms of value traded, Saudi Arabia witnessed a 30% drop in 2013, from 2012 value of USD 512bn, but bounced back with a 34% increase in 1H14 (USD 270bn) over 1H13. Continuing credit growth and introduction of the new mortgage law will spur activity in both banking and real estate sectors.

<b>Kuwait – Stalled development plans revitalized</b>
IMF estimates real GDP of Kuwait to rebound to 2.6% in 2014 and 3.0% in 2015 after a slowdown 2013. In the near term, hydrocarbon sector growth is expected to be flat due to a rise in oil supply globally, on account of easing of sanctions imposed earlier on Iran, and continued growth in supply from US. The non-oil sector is expected to drive growth in Kuwait. The recently announced second five-year development will continue to foucs on infrastructure. Kuwait also enacted new legislations to ease impediments and attract foreign direct investments. The ensuing political stability in Kuwait has renewed expectations on implementing the much needed structural reforms to revive the investment cycle. Materialization of Kuwait development plan by way of tendering project contracts and execution of the same is expected. In terms of value traded, Kuwait posted a 40% increase in 2013, from 2012 value of USD 26bn, but fell 57% in 1H14 (USD 11bn) over 1H13.

<b>The UAE- Winding down after the party</b>
According to IIF estimates, tourism, transportation, and trade will boost non-hydrocarbon growth to 5.2% in 2014, but real GDP growth will be moderate in the coming years due to declining contribution of hydrocarbon sector. Aggregate corporate earning in UAE came in at USD 8bn in 1H14, implying a YoY growth of 16%. Value traded in the first half of the year was close to four times the value for the equivalent period last year, due to upgrade to the MSCI EM index and the stellar performance of banks and real estate. But the heady optimism might be waning, as the valuations no longer appear attractive. The Arabtec fiasco in June has also raised serious questions about corporate governance and the role of regulators in ensuring a fair, efficient and transparent market in UAE. Preparations for the Expo 2020 and investments in infrastructure and real estate, should ensure continued growth in the Emirates.

<b>Qatar- Robust non-hydrocarbon growth</b>
Qatar is estimated to post strong real GDP growth rates of 5.9% in 2014 and 7.1% in 2015. Stagnation in hydrocarbon growth has led to decline in real growth to single digit. But gas production targets in Qatar have largely been met, and there are no current plans for a further increase after the Barzan project comes on-stream in 2014/2015. Non-hydrocarbon growth on the other hand is expected to be robust. Share of non-hydrocarbon sector in GDP (nominal terms) is expected to rise from 46% in 2013 to 50% in 2014 as the economy gets more diversified. Infrastructure expenditure in Qatar between 2014-2018 (excluding oil and gas) is expected to be at QAR 664bn (USD 182bn, or about 90% of 2013 GDP). In terms of value traded, Qatar recorded a 34% increase in 2013, from 2012 value of USD 16bn, and followed it up with an impressive 188% increase in 1H14 (USD 28bn) over 1H13 value of USD 10bn, as a result of the MSCI upgrade.

<b>Sector Focus</b>
<b>Banking and Financial Services Sector:</b> With increase in non-hydrocarbon growth, improving economic prospects and tremendous increase in asset values, there has been a surge in lending across the region, in the first half of the year. Financial services gained the most during 1H14, a total earnings growth of 35% on a YoY basis, whereas, banking firms had recorded a YoY growth of 6% in the first half of 2014. GCC loans and deposts are expected to grow by 11% respectively in 2014, maintaining a loan-to-deposit ratio of 86%, while loan loss provisions and NPA are witnessing a declining trend, which is expected to continue this year. Large government spending on infrastructure across GCC and continuing credit growth augurs well for the sector.

<b>Construction: </b>Recovery of real estate and large government spending in infrastructure across GCC over the next few years, will lead to increase in demand for construction and related materials. The total worth of planned and un-awarded construction projects exceeds USD 1.09 trillion, roughly two-thirds of the GCC’s entire annual GDP . Kuwait’s new development plan for 2015-20 outlines construction of the USD 20bn metro and USd 8bn rail project, which the GCC railway project. Qatar and UAE are expanding their metro, rail and road networks in preparation for their respective key events. Saudi Arabia has embarked on a social infrastructure drive, with 742 new schools and 40 colleges under construction, and 17 new hospitals being built. Youthful, growing population, influx of expatriate labor, focus on middle and lower income housing groups, and relaxation of rules allowing foreign ownership of real estate, will lead to increased activity in the sector over the next half decade.

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<span style="line-height: 21px;">The Indian Rupee (INR) is one of the worst performing currencies in the world during 2013 (Table-1). At Rs.65.5/USD it slid by a whopping 19.8% in 2013 (so far) after sliding down by 4% during 2012. The month of August was especially devastating. Since 2000, the current rupee level is the highest ever seen (look at the graph). From a low of Rs.39/dollar in Feb 2008, the Rupee is close to Rs.65.5/dollar. Repeated efforts by RBI to stem the rot went in vain so far. The trigger for such a dramatic fall has been attributed to US decision to roll back the Quantitative Easing (QE) as US economy has started showing signs of a pickup.</span>

The following questions emerge out of this:
1. Why did the rupee depreciate so fast?
2. How does it affect various people?
3. What is the further downside and where can it settle?
4. What is the long-term prospect of Rupee? &
5. What should be the strategy?

Let me try and answer them one by one:
<strong>1. Why did the Rupee depreciate so fast?</strong>
Technically rupee depreciates against the dollar when people sell rupee and buy dollars. And when people sell rupees and buy dollars, it results in negative capital flows and leads to downward pressure on the currency (and vice-versa). The following reasons can be explored:
a. US Monetary Policy
b. Slowing Indian Economy
c. Ineffective RBI
d. Corporate Debt and Hedge &
e. Weak domestic equity market

<strong>US Monetary Policy</strong>
The US Fed initiated a series of monetary easing programs more commonly known as Quantitative Easing (QE) which created copious amounts of liquidity in the global market. The simple idea behind QE is to purchase government bonds in order to keep the yields low, as low interest rate will then help economy recover. Now that the US economy is showing signs of recovery, the Fed has announced its intention to taper the QE i.e, stop buying the bonds. In response to this news, the bond yields started moving up and capital has started moving back to US in search of safety. In other words, capital left markets like India, Brazil, etc and is going back to US.

<em>Result: Investors flee other currencies and take shelter in US Treasuries (the so called safe haven) causing USD to strengthen and other currencies to weaken</em>

<strong>Slowing Indian Economy</strong>
The Indian economy, which was once heralded as the next big thing by economists around the world, has lost its sheen and grew by a decade low of around 5% in 2012-2013.

Indian economy’s deficit is spiraling out of control. Both the fiscal deficit (expenditure more than income) and current account deficit (imports more than exports at a simple level) are headed for further deterioration during 2013 and next. While the fiscal deficit is at 4.9% of GDP, the current account deficit is at 4.8% in the year 2012-13. The current account deficit is triggered primarily by trade deficit (Export-Import). Not only our imports exceed exports, but even within the imports the dominance is by oil and gold imports, something very difficult to control. Lack of progress in deficit reduction is causing poor foreign investor confidence which contributes to negative capital flows (meaning foreigners taking their money out of the country). The deficit is a long-term problem especially the fiscal deficit. No matter which government is in place, populist policies will continue as a tool to gain votes and this will ensure that the deficit does not come down. However, if they do not go up, then that itself will be good news.

Also, during the past few years, Indian government has attained notoriety for governance lapses (2G scam, etc) and policy missteps. Revising the IT Act retrospectively from 1962 in order to bring Vodafone to book was a huge blow to the confidence in our legal structure to foreign investors. Also, there were several governance failures that keeps India in the wrong side of the news globally (a good indication is the number of negative articles that appear in The Economist).

<em>Result: Foreign investors exit by selling rupees and buying dollars</em>

<strong>Ineffective RBI</strong>
Reserve Bank of India is tasked with ensuring the financial stability of the economy and hence is the sole inventor of the monetary policy. In the past, when currency encountered volatility or undue fluctuations, RBI used its foreign exchange reserves to intervene in the market (through purchase or sale of dollars) and thereby reduce the volatility of the currency. However, this time around, they raised their hand and declared openly their intention not to interfere in preventing the rupee slide. This may be due to limited foreign exchange reserves currently at $277 billion enough to cover only 7 months of imports. For China, it amounted to $3,500 billion and represented 21 months of import cover, a far comfortable situation to be in.

Instead, during the July and early August meetings, the RBI intervened by tightening the monetary policy. It increased the short term rates by hiking the marginal standing facility by 200 basis points. This further exacerbated the situation with the current economic conditions. During its latest meeting, it signaled a reversal of this tightening policy. Hence, we can clearly understand the predicament of RBI to intervene. While RBI has not interfered directly, it has taken several steps to contain the situation:
• It now requires exporters to repatriate 50% of export earnings placed in special accounts
• Restrictions on investments done abroad by Indian companies and citizens.
• Limits on intraday net open positions of foreign exchange dealers
• Restricting currency derivatives (to check speculation)
• Hiking the interest rate on NRI foreign currency deposits as well as rupee deposits

The major news that has hit the street and has buoyed sentiments of investors, corporates and economists alike is the appointment of Raghuram Rajan as the new Governor of RBI. The former chief economist of IMF is known for his famous prediction of the 2008 global financial crisis and is widely tipped to steer the Indian economy back to growth. In his first address as the RBI Governor, he hinted at the RBI taking actions to save the rupee (although his primary focus is on inclusive growth and development, as well as financial stability).

Following were the key measures that he alluded to for rupee stabilization on the first day of his office:
• More settlement of import trades in rupee which will help in lesser usage of dollars.
• Special swap window for Foreign Currency Non Resident Deposit B (FCNR B) to reduce cost of funds of banks by at least 250 basis points.
• Raising of Banks’s unimpaired Tier I capital to 100% from the current 50%.

<em>Result: RBI has no arsenal to arrest the slide immediately but is using other indirect means. Hope for appreciation of the rupee from the reforms taken by the new Governor.</em>

<strong>Corporate Hedge & Debt</strong>
Many Finance Managers, while managing their foreign exchange exposure, turned quite easy and relaxed due to continued rupee strength during the last few years especially during 2010 when rupee was averaging say 45 (you don’t need to hedge when rupee is strengthening if you are an importer and vice-versa). They expected this to continue forever and hence did not bother to hedge their currency risk exposures. Also, many of them resorted to foreign currency borrowing mostly in short-term maturities from European banks disregarding the rupee depreciation danger. However, when rupee started falling (much against their expectations) they were caught off guard and ran for cover to hedge their exposure which led to intense buying of dollars leading to its appreciation. Now many short-term corporate debt is coming up for repayment which will also witness more dollar buying adding to the rupee pressure. Also, the ability to rollover the debt will be limited by European banks due to the European crisis.

<em>Result: Companies will have to find dollars to repay their debt and incur loss due to unhedged positions</em>

<strong>Weak Domestic Capital Market</strong>
The Indian equity market has not been able to attract investments from Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) due to the weak economy and the poor performance by Indian corporates. Although the equity market has seen FII inflow of around $12 billion till August 2013, it has witnessed net FII outflow of $3.1 billion from June till August 2013 which has exacerbated the fall in the rupee. If you look at Table 2 the outflow seem to be more on debt than on equity. If this trend continues, it will result in the further depreciation of the rupee.

<em>Result: FIIs will continue to shun Indian equity unless the economic conditions become more favorable.</em>

<strong>2. How does it affect various people?</strong>
A rupee weakness affects the following:
• Importers (as they have to pay more rupees for the same dollar)
• Economic image of the country (not able to arrest the fall)
• Existing foreign investors (their investments are worth less now) &
• Residents (in the form of say high oil price)

On the other hand, it benefits the following:
• Exporters (as they get more rupees for the same dollar)
• Non-resident Indians (NRI’s) (as they get more rupees for the same dollar)

<strong>3. What is the further downside and where will it settle?</strong>
While domestic weakness in terms of low growth, high deficit, high inflation has contributed to the falling rupee, we should also blame the global financial crisis accentuating the problem for us especially Europe. This has caused many currencies in the world to fall (see Table 1, Brazil) apart from India. RBI is playing a sensible role of not exhausting our foreign exchange reserves and is allowing the market to determine the level of rupee. If required, it could call on SBI to raise external financing from NRI’s like how it did in 1998 and 2000 (remember the Millennium bonds!). However, the days of Rs.50-55 are gone. Political weakness is expected to continue with weak policy responses on all issues especially with the elections around the corner. There is no quick solution to deficit problems and inflation. In terms of where they will settle, Rupee is a moving target and hence it cannot settle anywhere. In terms of calls, investment banks place at from a pessimistic Rs. 70 to an optimistic Rs. 60 in the next 6-12 months.

Rupee Predictions by various Financial Institutions
Deutsche Bank – Rs. 70 (one month)
CRISIL – Rs. 60 (by Mar 2014)
Barclays – Rs. 61 (next 6-7 months)
UBS – Rs. 70
Credit Suisse – Rs. 65

<strong>4. What is the long-term outlook for the Rupee?</strong>
The current Rupee bash has raised some structural questions about the long-term potential of the Indian Rupee. Any call on the Indian Rupee is a function of the long-term performance of the Indian economy and the impact of global crisis in as much as it has an impact on India. India, along with China, is among the fastest growing economies in the world even after taking the current dip in growth. Given the right leadership, and reforms, the economic potential of India is certainly good. India is among a very select few countries in the world which does not have any sovereign borrowings in foreign currency. All its debt are domestic though Indian companies have foreign debt. Hence, the current abyss can not only be stopped but can be reversed with some wise leadership and policy reforms. With respect to global crisis, it cannot be predicted as to when and where it can arise. There are several pressure points in the world and anything can erupt anytime to cause tremors in emerging markets like India. Only sound monetary and fiscal policy can save the day for India.

<strong>5. What should NRI’s dp?</strong>
The rupee currently trades at Rs.230/KD after touching a high of Rs.240 on August 28th. From the level of.190/KD seen during May 2013, this represents a fall of nearly 25% within a span of 4 months, something that has never happened before. Therefore, for non-resident Indians, this probably is the best time to remit money to India. If you have dollar investments, it will be wise to exit the position and remit the money back to India. If you have rupee denominated debt, this probably is the best time to partly or fully wind it down using remittance from abroad. However, borrowing in local markets to remit money to India may be a dangerous strategy as this involves taking calls on both currency and interest rates, the two most difficult things to predict in life[:ar]<span style="line-height: 21px;">The Indian Rupee (INR) is one of the worst performing currencies in the world during 2013 (Table-1). At Rs.65.5/USD it slid by a whopping 19.8% in 2013 (so far) after sliding down by 4% during 2012. The month of August was especially devastating.

The rupee currently trades at Rs.230/KD after touching a high of Rs.240 on August 28th. From the level of.190/KD seen during May 2013, this represents a fall of nearly 25% within a span of 4 months, something that has never happened before. Therefore, for non-resident Indians, this probably is the best time to remit money to India. If you have dollar investments, it will be wise to exit the position and remit the money back to India. If you have rupee denominated debt, this probably is the best time to partly or fully wind it down using remittance from abroad. However, borrowing in local markets to remit money to India may be a dangerous strategy as this involves taking calls on both currency and interest rates, the two most difficult things to predict in life[:]]]></Content>

Spurred by high oil revenues, credit growth and economic diversification, real GDP growth rates in the GCC countries have been high in international comparison. They have been comparable to those of other emerging and developing markets and considerably higher than those of the world or the advanced economies on average. Together with growth in intra-GCC trade in the wake of the GCC customs union, this will lead to increased demand for financial services. This book explains these aspects and challenges of GCC financial markets. As financial markets often witness rapid change they are a moving target to study.<br />
<br />
Mandagolathur Raghu of Kuwait Financial Center (Markaz) gives an outline of the various segments of the GCC financial sector and relates them to macroeconomic figures such as GDP growth, money supply, fiscal balance and inflation. He gives particular attention to asset management practices and the structure of the banking sector and identifies areas where further institutionalization and professionalization are needed.<br />

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<strong>Food Security &ndash; Origin and Concept </strong><br />
<br />
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations states that &ldquo;food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life&rdquo;.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;4 Pillars of Food Security<br />
<br />
<img alt="GCC-Food-Security.png" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GCC-Food-Security-fig1.jpg" style="width: 498px; height: 280px;" title="GCC-Food-Security.png" /><br />
<br />
Countries around the world are striving hard to ensure food security for their people through methods affordable and suitable to their food availability and ability to produce food. The GCC countries realized the importance of food security after the World Food summit in 1974. These countries having realized the twin problems of increasing population and their inability to produce food on their own, have taken several steps. The GCC countries have invested in agricultural lands in countries like Sudan, Ethiopia, India and China. They have signed bilateral agreements with a few countries, mainly India, China and the US for supply of food grains. They provide food at subsidized prices to their people.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The population of GCC countries was 46.8 million in 2013 and is estimated to reach 50.3 million in 2025. GCC currently imports 80%-90% of its food requirements. The increasing population will add to the pressure on food imports. Hence, the GCC governments are keen to ensure that food prices are stable and affordable to all people. The key aspect of food security in GCC countries will be to find viable options to ensure consistent food supply through investments abroad, assured imports and developing their storage facilities to handle supply shocks apart from focusing on domestic agriculture.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Dr. Rashid Ahamed Bin Fahad, the UAE Minister of Water and Environment said &ldquo;The region is entering a new period of economic growth underpinned by a burgeoning population with a high dependence on imported food from around the world &ndash; food security is an immediate priority.&rdquo; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Why GCC countries need to focus on food security?</strong><br />
<br />
Apart from the increasing population in the GCC countries, these countries face supply side risks that make it very important for them to secure their position against food shortage.<br />
<br />
The recent Arab spring in the region and the trade sanctions against Syria, Iran and Libya shows that the food security of the people depends on the smooth political situation and relations in the MENA region.<br />
<br />
Geopolitics in the MENA region and the location of GCC ports is a major cause for concern.<br />
<br />
<strong>Choke points in sea trade:</strong><br />
<img alt="choke-point-sea-trade-(1).png" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GCC-Food-Security-fig2.jpg" style="width: 522px; height: 470px;" title="choke-point-sea-trade-(1).png" /><br />
<br />
<strong>Suez Canal</strong>: Around 7.5 tons of wheat and coarse grains are shipped through this canal annually from Europe and America. This accounts for 81% of total wheat imports by GCC in 2012. The problems in Egypt and the political turmoil in 2010 had completely blocked this route for a period of around 3 months, which may happen in the future too.<br />
<br />
<strong>Strait of Hormuz</strong>: This route accounts for 81% of rice imports by GCC, mainly from two countries India and China, and 35% of the wheat imports by the GCC countries in 2012. Political problems with Iran block this route often.<br />
<br />
<strong>Bab Al Mandab</strong>: This route accounts for 39% of the total imports of wheat and coarse grains by GCC countries in 2012. Navigation through these waters is vulnerable to piracy in Yemen. Pirates from food starving Somalia and Ethiopia also block the ships which make this route riskier.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The &ldquo;worst-case&rdquo; scenario can happen when all the three sea routes to the GCC nations are blocked together. If they fail to fix these geopolitical problems in a short span of time when these routes are blocked, it may happen that these countries may run short of food supply to feed their people.<br />
<br />
<strong>Price Risks</strong>: Price risks are another major factor to be considered in agricultural commodities. Countries across the world, especially India and China have restricted the export of rice from their countries due to domestic demand and supply constraints. North American countries have imposed similar bans on the export of wheat. Restrictions of essential commodities can lead to shortage of supply and increase their prices.<br />
<br />
<strong>Import &ndash; Export Parity</strong>: GCC countries are currently dependent on their oil exports to meet their import bills. They import almost every food commodity required. Reduction in oil prices, reduction in demand for oil in future due to shale gas discovery can strain the economy of these countries due to import of food commodities. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
The GCC countries currently face more supply side constraints in food sector. Supply shock can cause people in these countries to starve, especially those in the lower strata of the society. Increasing food prices can also affect the diet and nutritional balance of the people in GCC and create health problems in the long run.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<strong>Food Security Strategies Deployed in the GCC</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Price control and Subsidies</strong><br />
<br />
The GCC population benefits from a wide range of subsidies that ensures food remains affordable. The government provides subsidy through implicit as well as explicit fund transfers. Few governments in GCC compensate the private business houses for some or all of the cost incurred in the food industry as part of the implicit transfer. Explicit subsidies such as conditional transfer to the poor people for the purchase of food and import subsidy - when international food prices are high - are prevalent in GCC. &nbsp;These measures were used by GCC countries, especially during the 2007 and 2008 when food prices increased globally. In the year 2011, food inflation in Saudi Arabia and UAE was 15%, the highest during the period 2006-2012. This was mainly due to the restrictions imposed by the Government of India on rice exports. At that time the Saudi Arabian and the UAE governments increased the subsidy to help people meet their food requirements at affordable price. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Investments in Other Countries</strong><br />
<br />
Following the 2007-2008 food crisis, GCC countries started investing in overseas land for agriculture production. This took a variety of forms, mostly state led and a few investments done by the agro-businessmen in GCC countries. Land Matrix indicates that since 2000, GCC countries account for 19% of the global overseas investments in agriculture. Among the GCC countries, Saudi Arabia and the UAE were the important sources of investments. Together, Saudi Arabia and the UAE own and manage close to 3 million hectares of farmland primarily in Pakistan, Indonesia, Sudan, Ethiopia and Turkey as of 2013.<br />
<br />
<strong>Country Specific Measures to Ensure Food Security</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Saudi Arabia</strong><br />
The Saudi Arabian Government established Saudi Company for Agriculture Investment and Animal Production (SCAIAP) in 2011 with an initial outlay of USD 850 million. This is aimed at promoting both domestic and international agricultural projects. During 2011-2012, Saudi Arabia invested close to USD 23.1 billion in food security initiatives, which included financial and oil aid to target countries in lieu of agricultural lands. Planet Food World (PFWC), a private Saudi firm, plans to develop 20,000 farms in Turkey with a total investment of USD 3 billion.<br />
<br />
<strong>United Arab Emirates</strong><br />
In 2012, the UAE President ordered to subsidize prices of key food items across the country for an indefinite period. This move is expected to help the residents save approximately AED 13,000 per annum compared to AED 1,500 per annum previously. Organizations such as Arab Authority for Agricultural Investment and Development (AAAID) and Al Dahra Agriculture were formed for improving food security in the Emirates. AAAID, for instance, has established a Revolving Credit Fund, with a capital of USD 100 million, to finance small farm holders. The organization&rsquo;s investments are primarily directed toward agricultural processing, plant production and animal production.<br />
<br />
<strong>Bahrain</strong><br />
Bahrain allocated USD 174 million of food subsidies (for red meat, poultry and flour industries) in 2013, up from USD 145.8 million allocated in the previous year. The government has mentioned that the amount of subsidy on these basic staples will continue in 2014. Bahrain has invested in overseas projects in Sudan, Pakistan, Turkey, Thailand, Philippines, Ethiopia, India and Turkey by purchasing and privatizing large strips of agricultural land that are registered in Bahrain&#39;s name.<br />
<br />
<strong>Qatar</strong><br />
Qatar&rsquo;s strategy was different from the other GCC countries. Instead of investing in agricultural projects abroad, it envisioned a plan to make all investments in the home land. Qatar National Food Security Programme (QNFSP) was established in the year 2008 by Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, now His Highness, the Emir of Qatar. The aim of QNFSP is to make Qatar self-sufficient in food production by 2030. It is a comprehensive plan addressing land issues, water scarcity and production of agricultural crops. Qatar imported tons of fertilizers to make the land arable and has also started plans to desalinate water to irrigate the agricultural land. To make the land and water desalinated is a very costly issue, financially and environmentally. The desalination process would emit greenhouse gases which will add to the problem of climate change. Qatar has envisioned desalinating all the water requirements for agriculture by using Solar panels. This process would require 4000 acres of land for setting up solar panels, which would be the most expensive investment Qatar would make. QNFSP is currently waiting for the approval from Government Authorities to conduct a pilot project to desalinate land and water for agriculture. &nbsp;The nation being blessed with cash and being the richest in the world, can afford for such measures which are otherwise near to impossible.&nbsp;<br />
Qatar has become a major market for Genetically Modified (GM) crops and hence the government has plans to conduct research about cultivation of GM crops in Qatar.<br />
<br />
<strong>Oman</strong><br />
Oman invested USD 361 million over 2010 and 2011 on fisheries, modern irrigation systems, agricultural production and livestock breeding technologies. The government of Oman introduced a subsidy plan with retrospective effect (for food stuffs ‐ from February 2011 and for fodder ‐ from January 2011) in 2012.<br />
<br />
<strong>Kuwait</strong><br />
The government of Kuwait allocated USD 80 million in 2011 to Public Authority for Agriculture Affairs &amp; Fish Resources. In addition, in October 2012, the Kuwaiti ruler announced plans to launch a USD 7.11 billion Asian Food Security Fund along with Asian countries, which would help Kuwait, achieve food security.<br />
<br />
<strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
Food security is threatened in the GCC countries mainly by the supply side constraints it faces. Addressing them through policy initiatives and sustained efforts can help these countries mitigate the risks. Strategic stock holding will be the key to mitigate the supply risks, especially the risk of blockade of sea routes. Development of storage facilities for food grains and other essential food materials can hedge the risk of shortages during periods of political instability. The costs of infrastructure development and storage in this region will be lesser than the cost of domestic production considering the region&rsquo;s land and water problems.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Agricultural investments abroad will be the other option which can help GCC countries in the long run. GCC countries will have direct access to the production centers and can obtain food from their own land which they own abroad. Clear policy framework and long standing agreements between the GCC and countries where they own agricultural land is required in order to avoid instability that may arise due to policy changes. Most of the investments from GCC are focused towards countries like Sudan, Egypt, Ethiopia, Morocco and Pakistan. They need to rethink on their strategy as these are risky destinations considering the political instability and high rates of poverty. Agro-investments in developed countries are not only less risky, but will allow GCC countries to deepen strategic trade relationships through investment in key export partners.<br />
<br />
Domestic production can be done in horticulture which may consume less water than food grains. Domestic production of food grains is a less viable option for GCC countries considering the high cost factor associated with it due to unavailability of land and water.<br />
<br />
Food security is given importance by the GCC countries as they realize that the increasing population needs to be fed without any hindrances in the future. Strategic storage facilities and overseas investments in agriculture, mainly in the developed countries, will be the key in achieving food security in GCC. &nbsp;<br />

However, the current low oil price environment has transformed the financing landscape in the region as traditional methods of financing such as bank loans are being fast replaced with alternatives such as bonds, private equity, crowdsourcing and IOU’s.

The report added that budgetary deficits have forced the government to fix their deficits through debt issuance in both the domestic and international markets. The sudden spurt in debt issuance by the government and its related entities might be overwhelming for the domestic financial markets as evidenced by the spurt in short-term banking rates. Domestic banks that enjoy support from the governments have also been affected as the deposit mobilization process has slowed down. Subscription of domestic bonds issued by the governments has constrained the ability of banks to extend credit facilities as the loans-to-deposit ratio for banks across the region has reached the stipulated limits. Consequently, the banks themselves are issuing bonds to increase their capital ahead of various upcoming regulatory requirements. Though, the banks are well capitalized they may not be able to act as the dominant source of funding avenue.

In the case of Qatar, Oman and UAE where the loan-to-deposit ratio is much higher than 100% it would be difficult for banks to subscribe to state debt. They could take on government debt only at the expense of private credit growth. While government debt offers attractive yields, longer-term sovereign exposures which carries zero-risk weighting under Basel rules, higher sovereign issuances would crowd out borrowing space for private credits. Additionally, such measures would usurp liquidity in the system and lead to increased costs of funds in the money market. Interbank rates have already risen sharply as a consequence of it.

GCC countries, though comparable to most of the developed world in many aspects, fall short when it comes to the development of financial markets. The year 2015 saw the dampening of optimism and lower appetite for IPOs in the GCC countries as compared to the year 2014. There were only 6 IPOs in 2015 in the GCC region as compared to 1,144 IPOs globally in 2015 and 16 IPOs in GCC region, a year ago. This is largely attributed to the fall in price of oil which started in the second half of 2014. This led to a decrease in investor confidence and many IPOs were cancelled.

Private equity in the region is still at a nascent stage, though it showed some good progress between 2002 and 2008, the onset of global financial crisis stalled the growth of the industry. Private equity investments in the GCC region have been subdued since then with single digit fund closures in the last five years. PE funds raised in the region have declined by 78% during 2015 and the number of deals fell by 81%.

Issuance of corporate bonds (including sukuks) in the GCC are also largely restricted to the bigger companies. The absence of secondary markets for bonds further acts as a deterrant in the region. SMEs consistently face a hurdle in their effort to access finance. In 2016, it was estimated that there was close to USD 26bn gap in funding SME’s. Credit penetration to SMEs as measured in the form of bank loans provided to SMEs is among the world’s lowest for the GCC countries. It hovers around 2% as compared to 26% in OECD countries and 14% in non-GCC MENA countries, according to World Bank.

Other financing forms such as project bonds have gained prominence. A project bond is one that is associated with a particular project of the company and not the overall operations. Generally, these project bonds offer long-term investors attractive yields and significant credit spreads coupled with the security of the underlying asset. The bond’s proceeds are used to provide limited recourse, or non-recourse, financing to a single-purpose vehicle that owns, develops and builds a project. Ruwais Power Company issued project bonds in 2013, which set the precedence for project bonds in the power sector in the region.

In recent times, Saudi Arabia has toyed with the idea of issuing I-Owe-YoU certificate (IOUs) to pay for its outstanding bills with contractors and to conserve its cash reserves. KSA government owes approximately USD 40bn to country’s contractors and could issues IOUs in lieu of cash, which the contractors have the option to sell it to the banks or hold on until maturity.

Government’s in the region could also use the current economic scenario to move to a policy that brings in more private sector participation in the fund raising activities. SME Exchange is also being looked as an option to address the capital needs and fuel their growth. Peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding platforms, though at a nascent stage, are making rapid strides in the region especially for SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises) and start-ups by filling the gap left by conventional lenders.

Selling pressure created by Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) led to the fall in the Muscat index, while sharp fall seen in the Dubai index was attributed to profit booking, due to volatility in the international commodities and currency market. In terms of valuation, P/E of Morocco (18x), Qatar (14.3x) and Jordan (14.2x) markets were the premium markets in the MENA region, while the markets of Egypt (8.5x), Dubai (8.8x), and Oman (9.3x) were the discount markets.

Blue Chips also had a mixed month, with National Commercial Bank (Saudi Arabia) and Zain (Kuwait) ending the month at the top of the pile, gaining 33.5% and 16.4%, respectively. Kuwait Projects lagged behind the rest of the blue chips, falling by 10%, despite an 8% YoY rise in nine-month net profit. Although third quarter profit fell  by 1.6%, shares of NCB were buoyed by the expected easing of liquidity, as the kingdom issued international bonds to tide over rising deficit. The bank cited an 18.7% jump in total operating expenses, caused by higher impairments on financings and investments for the fall in net profit. Zain Kuwait's number of subscribers increased to 2.9mn for the nine months to 30 September, in a very challenging period that witnessed intense price competition. The company also reported a better than expected 12% rise in third-quarter profit.  Qatari telecom operator Ooredoo reported a 51% fall in third-quarter net profit, as the earnings continued to be affected by foreign exchange losses and plunging earnings from Iraq, although a strong domestic performance has helped mitigate the impact. Emaar Properties reported a 31% jump in third-quarter profit, as rising property sales overcame the wider real estate market malaise.

<strong>Saudi bond issue and market reforms</strong>
Saudi Arabia raised USD 17.5bn in the biggest ever bond sale from an emerging-market nation, as the kingdom sought to shore up finances battered by the slide in oil. The government supposedly sold dollar-denominated bonds due in five years yielding 135 basis points more than similar-maturity US Treasuries, 10-year notes at a spread of 165 basis points and 30-year securities at 210 basis points. The kingdom raised USD 5.5 bon in each of the five- and 10-year bonds, and USD 6.5bn in 30-year debt.

In a bid to improve foreign investment in capital markets and bring the Saudi stock market into the global investing mainstream, the nation's 175 listed companies are now required by the Capital Markets Authority to adopt the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) from Jan 2017.

<strong>Oil Market Review</strong>
Brent crude rose to USD 53.14 per barrel in the month of October, before falling 9% and closing the month at USD 48.3 per barrel, as the OPEC deal to reduce crude output faced some obstacles towards the end of the month. OPEC members Iran and Iraq disagreed with the organization’s data on production levels, and have now refused to limit their crude output. Iraq, the second-largest producer in the cartel, is reportedly asking for exemptions from any production limits due to disruptions caused by the insurgency, while other members, including Iran, Libya and Nigeria already have exemptions.

The government supposedly sold dollar-denominated bonds due in five years yielding 135 basis points more than similar-maturity US Treasuries, 10-year notes at a spread of 165 basis points and 30-year securities at 210 basis points. The kingdom raised USD 5.5 bon in each of the five- and 10-year bonds, and USD 6.5bn in 30-year debt.

In a bid to improve foreign investment in capital markets and bring the Saudi stock market into the global investing mainstream, the nation's 175 listed companies are now required by the Capital Markets Authority to adopt the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) from Jan 2017.

<strong>Oil Market Review</strong>
Brent crude rose to USD 53.14 per barrel in the month of October, before falling 9% and closing the month at USD 48.3 per barrel, as the OPEC deal to reduce crude output faced some obstacles towards the end of the month. OPEC members Iran and Iraq disagreed with the organization’s data on production levels, and have now refused to limit their crude output. Iraq, the second-largest producer in the cartel, is reportedly asking for exemptions from any production limits due to disruptions caused by the insurgency, while other members, including Iran, Libya and Nigeria already have exemptions.

Although the oil price rose by over 4 per cent, on the back of the OPEC agreement to limit crude output, Saudi index fell considerably after the Saudi government announced that it was reducing salaries and allowances for public sector employees. Many investors believe that additional austerity steps, such as new fees or taxes on the kingdom's large workforce of foreigners, could also be approved soon. Middle East fund managers have turned negative towards Saudi Arabian equities for the next three months because of the anticipated austerity policies.

Blue Chips also had a negative month, with Saudi Electric Company (SEC) and Ezdan Holdings (Qatar) ending the month at the bottom of the pile, losing 12.5% and 10.6%, respectively. Zain (Kuwait) and Kuwait Food Co. witnessed a gain of 4.7% and 3.3%, respectively. SEC signed a USD 1.3bn Islamic loan in September, after having already secured loans worth USD 3.8bn earlier this year. The company claims that this new loan will be used towards supporting its projects’ capital expenditure needs. The murabaha loan was supplied by three local banks: Banque Saudi Fransi, National Commercial Bank and Samba Financial Group. SEC also announced plans in August to privatize its assets by the end of the year, as part of a drive to increase efficiency in the kingdom's utilities. A few of the large cap stocks in the Qatar index were included in the FTSE’s Russell emerging market index in August. Investors cashed in on the gains post inclusion as a few stocks’ values retreated, with Ezdan Holdings featuring among them. Anticipation of Zain’s first unified telecommunications license to operate in Saudi Arabia, led to increase in share price in the month of September.

<strong>Saudi cuts public sector wages and Oman issues bonds to overcome deficit</strong>
Saudi Arabia cut ministers' salaries by 20 per cent, and scaled back financial perks for public sector employees in one of the most drastic measures taken by the energy-rich kingdom to save money, at a time when oil prices are sub-par. The measures, effective from October 2016, constitute the first pay cuts for government employees, who make up about two-thirds of working Saudi population. According to the announcement, housing and car allowances for members of the appointed Shoura Council will be cut by 15 per cent. Overtime bonuses are to be curbed at between 25 and 50 per cent of basic salaries, while annual leave may no longer exceed 30 days.
Oman has launched a combined USD 1.5bn tap of its June 2021 and June 2026 bonds. The five-year tranche will raise USD 500mn at 230bps over Treasuries, while the 10-year note will be for USD 1bn at plus 315bps. Oman is rated Baa1 by Moody's and BBB- by S&P.

<strong>Oil Market Review</strong>
Brent crude rose USD 2.02 per barrel in the month of September, after the OPEC members struck a deal to limit crude output. This is the first agreement to cut production, since 2008, and the deal will be finalized at its policy meeting in November. The group reached an agreement to limit its production within a range of 32.5m-33m million barrels per day (bpd) in talks held on the sidelines of the 26-28 September International Energy Forum in Algiers. At the month end, Brent crude had risen 4.3% to close at USD 49 per barrel, which represents a YTD increase of close of 32%.

<div style="text-align: justify;">

Cash flows, ownership structure and free float shares of the company combined affect the dividend policies of the company. Industries Qatar for instance is majority owned by the government of Qatar. Traditionally regional governments’ have held majority stake in companies that deal in natural resources in the region. Industries Qatar is a good example of the role that government ownership plays in dividend policies. The government of Qatar owns close to 67% of the company and thus enjoys higher say in formulating the dividend policies of the company which could be one of the reasons behind higher dividend pay-out ratio (60% till 2014). Qatar’s budget revenues consist of income from oil& gas, investment income and other incomes with investment income alone accounting for 30% of the revenues in 2015. Dividends from Industries Qatar roughly account for 6% of the investment income (majority of the dividends comes from Qatar Petroleum). As a result dividends serve as an important source of income for the government. Qatar government then spends this on developing the infrastructure in the country which goes in line with Industries Qatar’s dividend policies which lists sharing part of the wealth generated in the oil and gas segment with its shareholders as a key objective. As a result, the average pay-out ratio of dividends for the company till 2014 stands at 60%. Its capex as a % of cash flow from operating activities averages 27% over the observation period which suggests that the company has been generating enough cash flows to fund its capital expenses, liquidity, and withstand unexpected trading conditions. Positive cash flows has prevented the company from seeking outside capital for running its business and the company has used the positive cash flows to pay off some portion of its debt over the past four years. Revenues for the company peaked in 2012 following which it has witnessed a declining trend. Its three main segments: Petrochemical, Fertilizer and Steel have witnessed revenue declines of -13.5%,-9.7% and -12.4% during 2015. Weakness in oil prices has had an impact on prices of petrochemicals as well as fertilizers. Steel prices have suffered from global oversupply and weakness in key construction markets. Despite a lull in both top line and bottom line, the company has had positive cash flows from its operating activities which has been enough to cover its capital spending and pay dividends to its shareholders.

In contrast, Saudi Arabia Mining Company (Maaden) did not pay dividends at all during the period of study and therefore its wealth creation has entirely come from capital gains. This is despite Saudi government holding 65.42% of the company (direct holdings – 15.43% and public investment fund – 49.99%). Maaden’s operating cash flows have been positive however owing to its nature of its business it is required to invest a significant amount in securing future supply of mines. As a result of this, the company resorts to external borrowing since the cash flow from operations is not enough to cover its capex. From being debt free in 2008 it currently has a debt equity ratio of 1.66 times, significantly higher than the industry median of 0.45 times. Over the ten year period (2006-15) Maaden has cumulatively invested close to USD 20Bn on purchase of fixed assets, exploration of mining assets, project expansion etc. Its total debt issuances for the period amounts to USD 12.1B and almost of half of that has gone into purchase of fixed assets (USD 6Bn). Because it is cash negative due to high capex, it did not pay any dividends. However, exceptional topline and bottomline growth on the back of increase in price of the commodities has fuelled the growth of the share price over the years as a result of which all of the shareholders gains have been through capital appreciation. Maaden’s topline grew by 47% during 2006-15 which was largely driven by the growth in volumes in its key commodities i.e. Ammonia, Gold and Aluminum. Net profits grew at an annualized rate of 17% and would have been higher were it not for increase in selling/general and administrative expenses especially from freight and overhead charges. Industries Qatar and Maaden have managed to return 3.6% and 1.5% (CAGR) respectively.

Emirates Telecommunication (Etisalat) is one of the two major telecom operators in the UAE which is 60% owned by the Emirates Investment Authority while the rest is owned by institutional investors and general public. Etisalat’s dividend policy has been a generous one and positive cash flows from operations have ensured that it remains the same over the years. Etisalat has faced 5 instances when its market cap has declined on a YoY basis. Despite this the company’s stock has managed to add wealth to its shareholders fuelled by healthy growth in UAE in mobile and data segment. Analysing the cash flow statement reveals that the company has enough operating cash flows to cover its capital expenditures and overseas business acquisition. In the past ten years it has raised debt amounting to USD 7.5 Bn and close to 57% of the debt was raised in 2014. Net margins have remained in double digits over the years despite the saturation in the market owing to limited competition in the market (UAE has only two mobile operators). As a result of this the Return on Invested capital has managed to stay at higher levels.

The three case studies discussed here represent three models of wealth creation viz., only through dividends (Industries Qatar), only through Capital Gains (Maaden) and a combination of the two (Etisalat). As they say, dividends and capital gains are the two main pillars of wealth creation. A balanced contribution of both dividends and capital gains (like Etisalat) can result in robust long-term wealth creation than to depend on just one leg of wealth creation (like Maaden and Industries Qatar). This is borne out by their total return performance (see chart). While devising an investment strategy, it may be worthwhile to favour stocks that generated wealth for shareholders through a judicious combination of both pillars (dividends and capital gains) than just one. While 3 stocks may be too small a sample size, however the argument of balanced contribution from both sources of wealth creation still holds.

<img style="width: 759px; height: 355px;" title="MMR-September2016-fig1.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MMR-September2016-fig1.jpg" alt="MMR-September2016-fig1.jpg" />
Blue Chips were mixed in August with DP World and Ooredoo gaining 8.8 percent and 8.1 percent respectively. Four of the top five gainers were from Qatar, with Qatar National Bank and Industries Qatar share prices up by 7.5 percent and 6.1 percent respectively. Investors flooded their investments into Qatari large caps after the announcement of FTSE to include them into the emerging markets index on 24<sup>th</sup> August 2016. Saudi stocks were at the bottom, National commercial bank (NCB) and Saudi Telecom (STC) plummeted by 8 percent and 6.5 percent in August. Saudi Telecom Corporation’s profit for H1 2016 declined by 16percent YoY adding to the adverse sentiments attached to the Saudi stocks. Plans of Saudi Telecom to start its fourth generation mobile phone services in Egypt that was expected to give a boost to its revenue failed to materialize last month. With declining oil income, banks in Saudi Arabia are facing tightened liquidity position. Government deposits are expected to decline and banks have started to raise capital through bond issuances to manage their finances. All these factors reflect in the 8 percent decline in stock prices of the largest lender in the kingdom, NCB.

<strong>Saudi Arabia to encourage foreign investors </strong>
Saudi Arabia announced that it would liberalize restrictions on foreign investment in its securities markets on 4<sup>th</sup> Sep, sooner than previously indicated, in an effort to attract more institutional money into its bourse. When Riyadh opened its bourse to direct foreign investment in June 2015, it took a careful approach, imposing tight ownership limits and minimum qualifications for overseas institutions to reduce the risk of sudden changes in market dynamics. All types of foreign investors still own only 1.03 percent of the $390 billion market (Reuters).

Reforms in the stock market are in line with the country’s vision to reduce their dependence on oil. One major step in the direction is Saudi Aramco’s IPO, whose value is estimated to be anywhere from $2 trillion to $10 trillion. It would become difficult for the Saudi market to absorb the offer if foreign investments are highly restricted. Ambitious plans of the government depends on the success of the Saudi Aramco IPO, for which a foreign investor friendly market becomes a pre-requisite. Easing regulations for foreign investments can also be seen as a step towards Saudi’s inclusion into MSCI emerging market inclusion.

<strong>Oil Market Review</strong>
Brent crude entered into the bull market in the month of August with the hopes of a supply freeze early in September. Investors turned positive and the oil jumped 10.7 percent after the Saudi oil minister said that they would take action on the oversupply that flooded the market earlier. Uncertainties persist about the oil supply and prices in the coming months. Analysts claim that the oil rally might be short lived if OPEC and non-OPEC members fail to come to a consensus on supply freeze.

Despite relief in August, the threat oil faces is multi-pronged; rising inventories in the US, the myth of undisclosed oil stored in the Chinese islands, the consensus of talks between the oil producing countries and the resurgence of dollar that would further weaken the oil price. An increase in the US interest rates will strengthen the dollar, posing a threat to oil. Uncertainties apart, August provided a sigh of relief for the oil market.

		<Title>[:en]GCC Corporate Earnings fall by 8% in First half of 2016. Expected to fall by 4% in 2016[:ar]إنخفاض أرباح الشركات الخليجية بنسبة 8% في النصف الأول من عام 2016، ومن المتوقع أن تنخفض مرة أخرى بنسبة 4% في عام 2016[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">Total earnings in 1H16 came in at USD 32.8 billion, partly supported by telecom and financial services sector. Among sectors, telecommunications and financial services posted positive earnings growth, as contribution from international markets and favorable exchange movements supported their bottom line. Earnings in banking sector remained flat while earnings in commodities, real estate and construction related sectors contracted as the fall in oil prices is increasingly felt across non-oil sectors.<br />
<br />
Blue chips fared relatively better, while earnings of mid-cap and small-cap companies took a beating in H1 2016, falling by 38% (YoY) and 22% (YoY), respectively. Earnings for large cap stocks (market cap > USD 3bn; 60 companies, 73% of all GCC market cap) declined by 5% in 1H16. For the full year of 2016, we estimate earnings to fall by 4%.<br />
<br />
<img alt="GCC-Corporate-Earnings-H1-2016-fig1.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GCC-Corporate-Earnings-H1-2016-fig1.jpg" style="width: 634px; height: 404px;" title="GCC-Corporate-Earnings-H1-2016-fig1.jpg" /><br />
<br />
<strong>Saudi Arabia</strong><br />
Saudi Arabia witnessed a decline of 7% in net earnings in H1 2016, compared with the same period a year back. Earnings declined for all sectors except financial services. The highest decline in earnings were witnessed in the real estate (-50%) and conglomerate (-36%) sectors. We estimate full year earnings to fall by 6% in 2016, due to further fall in earnings in the commodities, banking and construction-related sectors, as growth is expected to be affected by depressed oil prices.<br />
<br />
<strong>Kuwait</strong><br />
Kuwait witnessed a decline of 6% in net earnings in H1 2016, with commodities, real estate and financial services declining by 11%, 23% and 53% respectively. Banking and telecom sectors were the only exceptions in Kuwait as their earnings bucked the declining trend. For 2016 full year, Kuwaiti corporate earnings are expected to fall by 2%, due to moderate growth in banking and telecom sector.<br />
<br />
<strong>UAE</strong><br />
Earnings for UAE companies witnessed a decrease of 8% in H1 2016 (YoY basis) owing to low oil prices, sluggish economy and poor performance of real estate companies. Real Estate sector as a whole declined by 4% during H1 2016 as real estate prices in the UAE were down owing to poor business sentiments and stagnant sales. We expect UAE corporate earnings to fall by 3%, as subdued credit growth is expected to take a toll on banking sector earnings in H2 2016 and on expectations of further earnings contraction in real estate sector.<br />
<br />
<strong>Qatar</strong><br />
Qatar earnings fell by 11% in H1 2016.&nbsp; Qatar&rsquo;s net earnings growth was affected by the fall in real estate sector earnings which fell by close to 50%. Telecommunications and banking sectors witnessed an increase in earnings during H1 2016 at 35% and 3%, respectively. We expect full earnings to be flat for Qatar in 2016 due to continued thrust on infrastructure developments and relatively better credit growth expectations than its GCC peers.</div>[:ar]<div style="text-align: justify;">Total earnings in 1H16 came in at USD 32.8 billion, partly supported by telecom and financial services sector. Among sectors, telecommunications and financial services posted positive earnings growth, as contribution from international markets and favorable exchange movements supported their bottom line. Earnings in banking sector remained flat while earnings in commodities, real estate and construction related sectors contracted as the fall in oil prices is increasingly felt across non-oil sectors.<br />
<br />
Blue chips fared relatively better, while earnings of mid-cap and small-cap companies took a beating in H1 2016, falling by 38% (YoY) and 22% (YoY), respectively. Earnings for large cap stocks (market cap &gt; USD 3bn; 60 companies, 73% of all GCC market cap) declined by 5% in 1H16. For the full year of 2016, we estimate earnings to fall by 4%.<br />

<br />
<strong>Saudi Arabia</strong><br />
Saudi Arabia witnessed a decline of 7% in net earnings in H1 2016, compared with the same period a year back. Earnings declined for all sectors except financial services. The highest decline in earnings were witnessed in the real estate (-50%) and conglomerate (-36%) sectors. We estimate full year earnings to fall by 6% in 2016, due to further fall in earnings in the commodities, banking and construction-related sectors, as growth is expected to be affected by depressed oil prices.<br />
<br />
<strong>Kuwait</strong><br />
Kuwait witnessed a decline of 6% in net earnings in H1 2016, with commodities, real estate and financial services declining by 11%, 23% and 53% respectively.

		<Title>[:en]Flat July for GCC Markets[:ar]وتشهد الأسواق الخليجية استقرارًا في شهر يوليو[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<img alt="MENA Market Trends – July 2016" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MMR-July-Fig1.jpg" title="MENA Market Trends – July 2016" />
<div style="text-align: justify;">Blue chips drove Qatar&rsquo;s index surge, with real estate (8.52%), telecoms (7.94%) and banking stocks (7.1%) performing well in July. The recently announced Qatar&rsquo;s fuel subsidy reform will also help shrink its budget deficit by reducing expenditures; a move that will help investments in private sector. Saudi index fell due to fall in oil price, and the continued resilience of shale oil, as increasingly efficient US shale production continues to drive a wedge in OPEC&rsquo;s strategy of flooding the market with excess crude.<br />
<br />
Blue Chips had a mixed July, with Emaar Properties (UAE) and Ezdan Holdings (Qatar) ending the month at the top, gaining 10% and 9.6%, respectively. National Commercial Bank (Saudi Arabia) and First Gulf Bank (UAE) witnessed a slump, losing 6.0% and 4.4%, respectively. Positive Q2 results contributed to improved market performance for most companies in the region, as investors returned to the markets post Ramadan. Dubai&#39;s Emaar Properties reported a 8% rise in Q2 net profit, as strong investor demand led to higher revenue recognition. Ezdan Holdings half-yearly profit went up 8%, driven by rise in operations. Despite posting a profit of 3.2% in Q2, shares of National Commercial Bank declined the most in July, as the bank proposed a lower dividend for the first half of the year, as compared to the previous year. Q2 profits of First Gulf Bank slipped 10%, meeting analyst estimates, while the merger between FGB and National Bank of Abu Dhabi was confirmed early in July.<br />
<br />
<strong>Rise in Debt issuance</strong><br />
According to IIF, GCC countries are turning to both domestic and foreign debt markets to finance their rising fiscal deficits, and this trend is likely to persist in the short to medium term. Since mid-2014, the drop in oil prices has shifted the large aggregate current account surpluses of GCC countries, accumulated in the past decade, to a deficit of USD 35bn in 2015, and this is expected to widen to USD 89bn or 6.5% of the GDP in 2016. The large resident capital outflows in the form of investments, which peaked at USD 384bn in 2013, have virtually disappeared, and international reserves are being used to fund widening deficits.<br />
<br />
Prior to 2016, GCC sovereign debt issuance had been relatively sparse, barring Bahrain, particularly in foreign currency, and usually reserved for benchmarking or for monetary policy purposes. Thus far, in 2016, both Abu Dhabi and Qatar have tapped international markets with sizeable issues.<br />
<br />
<strong>Fall in Real Estate transactions</strong><br />
Saudi Arabia has registered a sharp drop of 56.7% in the total weekly sales, settling at USD 0.5bn, the lowest weekly level in a decade. Experts claim this drop in sales was caused by the low demand that followed the implementation of the so-called white land fees regulation, which pushed people who want to buy properties to wait for a real decline in prices.<br />
<br />
<strong>Oil Market Review</strong><br />
Brent crude fell sharply by 14.5% in the month of July, closing at USD 42.46 per barrel; the lowest close in 4months. Oil output from the Middle East rose to a record high in June, with production rising above 31mn barrels per day for the third month running. Supply from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has risen to 33.41 million barrels per day (bpd) in July from a revised 33.31 million bpd in June, adding downward pressure on prices.</div>[:ar]<img alt="MENA Market Trends – July 2016" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MMR-July-Fig1.jpg" title="MENA Market Trends – July 2016" />

		<Title>[:en]Revealed: The 30 most valuable non-banking companies in GCC[:ar]الشركات 30 الأعلى قيمة سوقية من الشركات غير المصرفية في دول مجلس التعاون الخليجي[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">ROE is one of the important parameters that is used to evaluate the strength of the company as well as the return the company generates for the equity holders. ROE is also a measure of efficiency of functioning of the company. Debt to equity (D/E) indicates the leverage and thereby the risk the company faces due to its capital structure. As D/E ratio is a comparative measure, we have ranked the companies based on the measure to indicate companies that are less risky and have durable business models compared to other companies in GCC. PAT growth percentage is considered as it is important for the companies to increase their profits over the years in order to be sustainable.<br />
<br />
<strong>Top 30 Most Valuable Companies</strong><br />
&nbsp;Top 30 most valuable companies have been weighted on the three parameters and ranked based on the quality score. Jarir marketing with its low leverage of 0.03 and average annual PAT growth percentage of 13% registered an astonishing ROE of 57.86%. This indicates that the company operates with minimum risk and yet has generated better returns for the equity holders. Net profit of Jarir marketing increased by 11% in 2015 compared to its net income in 2014 mainly due to increase in revenue from the retail segment. In 2014, the company reduced its debt to equity ratio to 0.1 and in 2015 it was further brought down to 0.03 as the company repaid its long term debt with the excess cash it generated.<br />
<br />
Similarly companies such as Arabian Cement Company, Medicare group and Taiba holdings registered average annual PAT growth percentage of 67%, 68% and 80% respectively. The top 5 most valuable companies have maintained D/E ratio lesser than 0.1 (except Al Tayyar Travel Group). Al Tayyar Travel Group Holding, despite having a D/E ratio of 0.37 had registered a higher ROE of 34.1% and its average PAT growth percentage was 16% due to which it ranked 4<sup>th</sup> among the most valuable companies in GCC.<br />
<br />
Medicare group&rsquo;s net profits surged by 316% from USD 12 Mn in 2012 to USD 50 Mn in 2015. The surge in profits were mainly due the business expansion of Medicare group and thereby higher revenue generated from core operations increased.<br />
<br />
Saudi Cement Company (SCC), one of the largest cement manufacturers in Middle East, reduced its D/E ratio from 0.3 in 2011 to 0.22 in 2015. SCC repaid most of its long term debt with retained earnings as a part of the corporate strategy determined in 2011. SCC has also streamlined its operations and improved its operational efficiencies. However, increasing labor expenses due to Saudization led to decline in net margins from 53% in 2014 to 48% in 2015. Yanbu cement has one of the best operational efficiency among the cement companies in GCC. It has continuously expanded its capacity since 2008, in anticipation of increased demand. With low costs of operations, the company&rsquo;s average PAT grew at 4% and with D/E ratio of 0.04, the company generated ROE of 22.29%.<br />

<strong>Analysis of 30 valuable companies</strong><br />
KSA companies constitute 66% of the top 30 most valuable companies followed by UAE and Qatar with 17% weightage each. None of the companies from Oman and Bahrain featured in the top 100 list as most of them had lesser free float compared to the companies in the larger markets such as KSA, UAE and Qatar. Though four large cap Kuwaiti companies were in the top 100 list, three of the companies were banks and the other company, Mobile telecommunications (Zain), had negative average PAT growth rate.<br />

Among the top 30 most valuable companies, there are only four large cap companies from UAE, two each from the real estate and telecommunications sector. There are 10 mid cap companies and 16 small cap companies, mainly from the basic materials and consumer non-cyclicals sector respectively.<br />

<strong>Stock market performance of 30 most valuable companies in GCC</strong><br />
Out of the top 30 most valuable companies, 27 companies registered positive average annualized returns during the same period. Only 3 companies i.e., National Medical Care Company, Northern Region Cement Company, and Eastern Province Cement Company stocks registered negative CAGR of 13%, 9% and 1% respectively during 2011-2015.<br />
<br />
Medicare Group and Al-Meera were the companies that registered maximum returns (5 year CAGR) of 49% and 43% during the same period. Medicare Group, Qatar registered an average PAT growth of 67% during 2013-2015 and the return on investment (ROE) in 2015 was 17.84%. Foreign investors invested heavily in the stock in 2015 as they felt the outlook for the company was positive with its strong fundamentals apart from the positive outlook for the sector in Qatar. Al-Meera consumer goods (Qatar) has expanded its operations in the past and witnessed increase in sales in 2015. The average PAT growth percentage was 24% (2013-2015) and the ROE was 11.7% in 2015. The company has planned for major expansions in the coming years and has attracted investors from Qatar and GCC (Reuters, Peninsular Qatar).<br />
<br />
On performing a back-test for a portfolio consisting of the top 30 companies, it can be seen that they have outperformed the S&P GCC index by 175% during the period 2011 and 2015. Financials sector accounts for 51.6% of the weightage in S&P GCC index. Poor performance of the financial sector companies with heavyweights such as National Commercial Bank, Qatar National bank, Al Rajhi Banking, Samba Financial group and National Bank of Kuwait in the index led to the poor performance of the S&P GCC index.<br />

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<img alt="MENA Market Trends – June 2016" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MENA-Markets-Mixed-Oil-flat-post-Brexit-fig1.jpg" />
<div style="text-align: justify;">S&P GCC rose marginally by 1.1% in June, to close at 91 points.

<strong>Brexit and the GCC</strong><br />
The outcome of the vote and the resultant decision of Britain to leave the European Union (EU) caught the financial markets by surprise. The broad sell-off across continents and asset classes could be because of misplaced initial expectations for a &ldquo;Remain&rdquo; victory. GCC markets remained relatively unscathed except for UAE markets; Dubai index lost 3.3% while Abu Dhabi lost 1.8%.

Impact on oil would be minimal since Britain consumes only 1.6% of global consumption and ranks 15 among global consumers. The more serious impact would be if there is contagion to the rest of the European Union. Imports from the UK will become cheaper, such as cars, capital equipment etc. Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) and HNIs in GCC are known to invest heavily in London&#39;s real estate. Investors from the UAE accounted for more than 20% of buy-to-let property sales in the UK in 2015.

GCC region has been in talks with EU region for over 25 years and the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the regions is still pending.

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">Corporate profits and net margins at an aggregate level have been on a clear downward trend but the aggregate profit margin conceals diverging performances between the different sectors.<br />
<br />
Profit margins in sectors such as basic materials, industrials, energy, utilities and telecommunication services have been affected by various factors.<br />
<br />
Subdued activity in the infrastructure space, softening real estate activity and a prolonged working capital cycle have eroded margins for contractors and construction material providers.<br />
<br />
For firms operating in the energy and industrial sectors, lower realisations for petrochemical products and a stronger currency has affected margins. Intense competition, leading to a declining average revenue per user, a saturated market and foreign exchange losses have restrained profit margins for telecommunication service providers.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, firms in technology, finance &ndash; particularly the non-banking financial corporations &ndash; healthcare and consumer non-cyclical sectors have all done well over the past five years.<br />
<br />
Margins for firms providing financial services such as loans, working capital, insurance, wealth management products and leasing solutions have expanded the most. The lower cost of capital, ample liquidity and regulations that call for the mandatory purchase of insurance have aided in their stellar growth.<br />
<br />
Post the global financial crisis, regional banks went into deleveraging mode as they sought to clean up their books. Their conservative stance following this has focussed on large-scale corporations while the lucrative small and medium sized enterprise space was largely ignored.<br />
<br />
Small and medium sized enterprise loans, as a percentage of bank credit, is among the lowest in the region, indicating the lack of attention the sector has been given. Non-banking financial corporations, with their localised presence, have leveraged this opportunity and effectively serviced it, increasing their margins in the process.<br />
<br />
Food processing firms, retailers, fast moving consumer goods players, wholesale distributors and traders have also done well. Favourable demographics, rising per capita incomes and a lifestyle which is consumption-driven have benefitted the consumer non-cyclical sector.<br />
<br />
The prevalence of lifestyle diseases such as obesity and a spurt in medical tourism has resulted in healthy margins for hospitals, medical equipment manufacturers and pharmaceutical distributors.<br />

<br />
Going forward, we expect margin pressures to continue in basic materials, industrials and energy sectors. Oil is not expected to rebound any time soon and restrained government spending could lead to stalled infrastructure projects. Poor labour productivity will continue to squeeze margins in labour intensive sectors while increasing interest rates and liquidity problems could be a headwind for financials.<br />
<br />
It is hard to sustain higher margins as profitable industries are bound to attract competition. However, companies that can successfully create moats by establishing a significant competitive advantage over their rivals can sustainably grow their profits. This, however, is easier said than done.<br />
<br />
Additionally, profitability is just one part of the equation. Profitability along with sustainable long-term growth adds significant value to the stakeholder. Identification of opportunities for growth should be of significant importance for management teams.<br />
<br />
While profitable operations ensure survival of the firm, evaluating growth opportunities and successfully investing in them creates value and leads to long-term success.</div>[:ar]<div style="text-align: justify;">Corporate profits and net margins at an aggregate level have been on a clear downward trend but the aggregate profit margin conceals diverging performances between the different sectors.<br />

<div style="text-align: justify;">

The Tadawul All Share Index plans to increase the listings to 250 companies from about 170 now, over the next seven years. Its current market capitalization of $396 billion is expected to add close to $ 120-130 bn post the IPO of Aramco and possible inclusion into the MSCI emerging market index by Mid-2017. The aim of the government is to increase the size of Saudi Arabia’s stock market to match that of its GDP within seven years (2014 -$798 Bn) as part of the vision 2030 statement released by the country’s crown prince. Another aim of the government is to make the stock market a better representative of the economy. Currently Financials dominate the stock market capitalization accounting for 39% of the stock market with stocks in the energy segment accounting for 21% of the market. In terms of GDP however the share of energy companies is double that figure at close to 40%. We have tried to find out the changes that both these events would have on the distribution of the stock market capitalization.

Large-scale infrastructure spending combined with the currency peg and the necessity to finance budget deficits means that the Saudi Arabian government should look at alternative means of increasing its income. IMF (The International Monetary Fund) warned in October 2015 that Saudi Arabia could run out of financial assets by 2020 if the government maintained its current policies and spending patterns underscoring the need to shore up public finances.

In a recent announcement, Saudi Arabia announced a string of reforms to its capital market that could attract billions of dollars of foreign money and smooth sales of state jewels – for instance Saudi Aramco. There were three major changes that were introduced in the Saudi capital market – Increased foreign ownership, Securities lending and Short Selling.
<ul>
 	<li>Individual foreign institutional investor will be allowed to own a stake of just under 10 percent of a single listed company, up from a previous ceiling of 5 percent. Currently only Saudi British Bank and Banque Saudi Fransi are the two companies that have more than 5% foreign holding which are promoters’ holding of HSBC and Credit Agricole respectively.</li>
 	<li>All foreign investors combined will still be limited to owning 49 percent of any single firm.</li>
 	<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Top  companies (by M.Cap) -  Foreign Holdings </strong><img src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KSA-Capital-Market-Reforms-Fig2.jpg" alt="• Top companies (by M.Cap) - Foreign Holdings" /></li>
 	<li>This would increase the institutional investors investing the market. Single QFI (Qualified Foreign Investor) could hold onto a higher percentage of a company’s share possibly opening opportunities for higher corporate governance related disclosures, trading volumes and analyst coverage.</li>
 	<li>Removal of the 10% ceiling on combined ownership by foreign institutions of the market's entire capitalization. Since its opening last June the total direct and indirect foreign investment accounts for close to 4.28% percent of the stock market capitalization according to Tadawul as of 26<sup>th</sup> May 2016.</li>
 	<li>Reduction of minimum assets under management to USD 1 bn instead of USD 5 bn.</li>
 	<li>Allow new type of foreign institution including Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) and University Endowments. Currently there are 9 QFIs who have registered with the Saudi CMA (Capital market Authority) for investing in the stock market.</li>
</ul>
Other changes that were introduced included – introduction of securities lending, covered short selling and extending the settlement of trades to the globally followed standard of T+2 days instead of the current T+0 days. The T+0 days had put lot of foreign investors in trouble as they had to settle the trade within the day which required huge amount of capital to be ready before trading. Also, given the Sunday - Thursday business week, things get even more complicated. Securities lending and short-selling would help in price discovery helping in better efficiency in the market.

<span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Possible Impact of these regulations</strong></span>
<strong>Increase in foreign Ownership </strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Increased Foreign investment
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
 	<li>Increasing foreign investment is prime objective of opening up the stock market which would further enhance the appeal of stock market to sophisticated HNWIs of the region.</li>
 	<li>Taking the top 20 stocks alone, if foreign investors increase their shareholding by 5% we could expect $13 Bn to enter into the market. However, assuming immediate investments from foreign investors may be premature. Refer to the analysis below to get a better understanding (Market Opened - Where are the foreign investors?).</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Improved shareholder protection and disclosure –
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
 	<li>Foreign Investors would require a robust framework to be present in order to invest into the country. While increasing the investment limit is only part of the story, ensuring equal rights for foreigners would assure them of a legal recourse</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Possible improvement in market cap as well as volumes/value traded
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
 	<li>The Dubai Financial Market General Index doubled in the two years since the news of the MSCI upgrade was announced in June 2013.</li>
 	<li>Institutional investment is bound to add more liquidity supporting measures by constantly trading in these stocks</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Diversified Institutional Investor base
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
 	<li>Sophisticated foreign investors would make the market more efficient which would dampen knee-jerk reactions from the stock market during turbulent economic times</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Improved analyst coverage
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
 	<li>Analysts from the Saudi Arabia and other GCC countries would start covering Saudi  stocks more as foreign investors start to look for alpha stocks outside of the index</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Improve corporate governance practices</li>
</ul>
<strong>Securities lending</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Higher Liquidity
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
 	<li>Securities lending is a practice that has helped developed markets achieve higher liquidity by prompting short-sellers to be more active in the market</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Price discovery
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
 	<li>More number of sellers due to short selling which ensures lower bid-ask spread – Bulk trades influence the markets – Upward price movement of 0.5% for block purchases and downward revision of -0.38% for block sales according to Price Impact of Block Trades in the Saudi Stock Market working paper prepared by Ahmed A. Alzahranai, Andros Gregoriou, Robert Hudson and Kyriacos Kyriacou</li>
 	<li>Opportunity for earning by loaning out the securities which could lower the cost of holding for  institutional shareholders</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Required for covered short-selling</li>
 	<li>Could open up opportunities for derivatives trading
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
 	<li>Derivatives have not been able to make much of inroads into the region hitherto which could increase the depth of KSA’s market</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>Settlement of Trades</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Less capital needed upfront as settlement can take two days instead of the current cycle of T+0</li>
 	<li>Possible inclusion into MSCI index
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
 	<li>T+0 settlement was cited as an hindrance in MSCI’s Saudi Arabia market accessibility review removal of which should help Saudi Arabia gain a place in MSCI’s emerging market index</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
The exact timeline for the implementation of these measures would only be known by 1<sup>st</sup> half of 2017. Lengthy time consumed for reforms to materialize could be a deterrent for overseas funds and foreign institutions from bringing their money into Saudi Arabia. Since June 2015, the total direct and indirect foreign investments account for 1% of the USD 408 Bn Saudi stock market. As of December 2015, there were only nine foreign institutions that had registered in Saudi Arabia as foreign institutions.

<strong>Market Opened - Where are the foreign investors?</strong>
Saudi Arabia opened up its markets to investors during June 2015 following the announcement in 2014. Liberalizing the stock market, one of the few major global exchanges to have restricted foreign access was expected to attract a huge amount of foreign investors. However the expectations failed to materialize which resulted in the stock market falling on the day that foreign investors were allowed to trade. Primary reasons for the poor show on the day of market opening were two – Initially, Foreign Institutions that had applied for license did not get them on time and stock market valuations were on the higher side compared to regional markets. The situation continues to persist with foreign holdings not seeing any major improvements. QFI holdings remain below 1% for many large cap stocks.

<strong>Rich valuations play spoilsport – </strong>When the stock market opened up to investors last June it was already the region’s top performer returning 15% (As of June 2015) and trading at a PE of 15.5 times its 12 month forward earnings. In comparison the broader Middle East market were trading at a multiple of less than 14 times earnings while global emerging markets were trading at 11.9 times. Saudi Arabia is not part of MSCI EM index and currently features as a standalone market closing the doors for passively managed funds. Actively managed funds as opposed to passively managed funds are very choosy about their investments and would only invest if the returns are expected to be commensurate with the level of risk. Investor sentiments were further dampened by the deteriorating economic conditions in Saudi Arabia due to decline in oil prices. Banking sector which form the majority of the market cap was worst affected.

<strong>QFIs shareholding remains well below 5% - What is the point in changing it to 10% - </strong>Some analysts also point out that this was more of a measured opening to help foreign investors get a feel of the market and for Saudi Arabia to adjust itself to foreign investors. Recent reform announcements suggests that Saudi Arabia is serious about bringing in foreign investors and getting into indices provided by MSCI (particularly EM Index) and FTSE. On successful inclusion more foreign investment can be expected to reduce tracking errors of foreign funds tracking such indices.

<strong>How will the market segmentation look like in 2017?</strong>
There is a significant difference between the composition of GDP and the stock market segmentation (by market capitalization). Decision on Saudi Arabia’s inclusion into emerging market index is expected to be taken by MSCI by Mid-2016 and possibly addition into the index would happen by mid-2017 with an initial country weightage of 2%. We look at how this can affect the sector composition of Saudi Arabia’s stock market.

The exact timeline for the implementation of these measures would only be known by 1<sup>st</sup> half of 2017. Lengthy time consumed for reforms to materialize could be a deterrent for overseas funds and foreign institutions from bringing their money into Saudi Arabia. Since June 2015, the total direct and indirect foreign investments account for 1% of the USD 408 Bn Saudi stock market. As of December 2015, there were only nine foreign institutions that had registered in Saudi Arabia as foreign institutions.

<strong>Market Opened - Where are the foreign investors?</strong>
Saudi Arabia opened up its markets to investors during June 2015 following the announcement in 2014. Liberalizing the stock market, one of the few major global exchanges to have restricted foreign access was expected to attract a huge amount of foreign investors. However the expectations failed to materialize which resulted in the stock market falling on the day that foreign investors were allowed to trade. Primary reasons for the poor show on the day of market opening were two – Initially, Foreign Institutions that had applied for license did not get them on time and stock market valuations were on the higher side compared to regional markets. The situation continues to persist with foreign holdings not seeing any major improvements. QFI holdings remain below 1% for many large cap stocks.

<strong>Rich valuations play spoilsport – </strong>When the stock market opened up to investors last June it was already the region’s top performer returning 15% (As of June 2015) and trading at a PE of 15.5 times its 12 month forward earnings. In comparison the broader Middle East market were trading at a multiple of less than 14 times earnings while global emerging markets were trading at 11.9 times. Saudi Arabia is not part of MSCI EM index and currently features as a standalone market closing the doors for passively managed funds. Actively managed funds as opposed to passively managed funds are very choosy about their investments and would only invest if the returns are expected to be commensurate with the level of risk. Investor sentiments were further dampened by the deteriorating economic conditions in Saudi Arabia due to decline in oil prices. Banking sector which form the majority of the market cap was worst affected.

<strong>QFIs shareholding remains well below 5% - What is the point in changing it to 10% - </strong>Some analysts also point out that this was more of a measured opening to help foreign investors get a feel of the market and for Saudi Arabia to adjust itself to foreign investors. Recent reform announcements suggests that Saudi Arabia is serious about bringing in foreign investors and getting into indices provided by MSCI (particularly EM Index) and FTSE. On successful inclusion more foreign investment can be expected to reduce tracking errors of foreign funds tracking such indices.

<strong>How will the market segmentation look like in 2017?</strong>
There is a significant difference between the composition of GDP and the stock market segmentation (by market capitalization). Decision on Saudi Arabia’s inclusion into emerging market index is expected to be taken by MSCI by Mid-2016 and possibly addition into the index would happen by mid-2017 with an initial country weightage of 2%. We look at how this can affect the sector composition of Saudi Arabia’s stock market.

S&amp;P GCC also declined by 5.1% in May, to close at 90 points. Worries over contraction in the construction industry and possibility of rise in provisions and non-performing loans in regional banks made investors wary of taking long-term positions in banking and construction shares, despite positive Q1 results for the former.<br />
<br />
MENA markets liquidity had a negative month, with volumes decreasing by 32% and value traded falling by 7%. Morocco and Bahrain witnessed increases in both volume and value traded, whereas the rest of the markets recorded declines in both. Volume and value traded in Morocco increased by 32% and 44%, respectively, despite which the index declined by 2.2% in May.<br />
<br />
Most Blue Chips ended the month of April in red, barring Emirates NBD (UAE) and Saudi Electricity (SEC, KSA). Emirates NBD entered into a co-location agreement with Du that will help optimize operational expenses, and provide direct access to vital data center ecosystem. The Saudi government is reviewing plans to break up SEC into four divisions, as part of a drive to privatize the utility. NBAD (UAE, -12.2%) and Ooredoo (Qatar, -10.6%) stocks had a poor streak in May. Financial institutions in Abu Dhabi are witnessing tightening liquidity conditions due to weaker energy revenues, prompting NBAD to look beyond domestic operations for revenue. Ooredoo posted a Q1 revenue of USD 2.16bn, down 2% from 1Q15, as revenues from the voice segment contracted. Arabtec Holding (UAE) declared a loss of USD 12.6mn for the first quarter of the year, as the company struggles with a difficult environment, due to slowdown in Gulf economies and governments restraining spending because of low oil prices. Ongoing expansion of projects and comprehensive development plans on facilities and assets have helped Ezdan Holding Group (Qatar) record a USD 161mn first-quarter net profit, a 12% growth compared to the USD 143.5mn posted in 1Q15.<br />
<br />
<strong>Saudi Arabia Market Reforms</strong><br />
Saudi Arabia announced a string of reforms to its stock market in a bid to attract billions of dollars of foreign investment, and to facilitate the smooth sales of state assets, as the kingdom grapples with deficit caused by low oil prices. In Jun&rsquo;15, the Saudi CMA took a cautious approach to market reforms, however, in May&rsquo;16, more reforms were announced to aggressively court foreign investors.<br />
<br />
In May 2016, the kingdom announced a cut to the amount of assets foreigners must have under management to invest directly in the nation&rsquo;s stocks to USD 1bn from USD 5bn in Jun&rsquo;15. The CMA will also now accept investments from sovereign wealth funds and university endowments. The exchange will also amend its settlement cycle to T+2 (from T+0) for share trading, bringing it in line with European markets. Each of the foreign institutional investors (FIIs) will be allowed to own directly a stake of just under 10 per cent of a single listed company, up from a previous ceiling of 5 per cent. Other restrictions were scrapped, including a ceiling of 10 per cent on combined ownership by foreign institutions of the market&#39;s entire capitalization. All foreign investors combined will still be limited to owning 49 percent of any single firm.<br />
<br />
Saudi CMA has also approved the introduction of securities lending and covered short selling to the stock market, which would give investors more options to hedge their purchases against market downturns. The changes will be effective before the end of the first half of 2017.<br />
<br />
<strong>Oil Market Review</strong><br />
Brent crude crossed the USD 50 per barrel in the month of May, the first time since Nov&rsquo;15, before climbing down marginally, and closing the month at USD 49.69 per barrel, up 3.2 per cent from last month&rsquo;s close. Supply disruptions in Nigeria, Canada and Venezuela, and stronger overall demand has led to rise in price of the oil this month. Investors brushed aside concerns regarding higher Middle East output, as fight for market share between Saudi Arabia and Iran is on the cards.</div>[:]]]></Content>

The market capitalization of the Saudi Arabian stock market is currently around USD 400bn and the IPO of Aramco could add further USD 100bn to the market capitalization (Financial Times). Inclusion of Saudi Aramco in energy sector would increase its weightage from the current value of 21.1% to 36.8% in the Tadawul index pushing the dominant financial services sector from the top spot. We believe the revised weightage where petrochemicals/energy sector dominates the index rather than the financial sector is a better representation of the underlying economic structure of Saudi Arabia.
<div style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<img alt="Figure: Tadawul Sectorial Weightings, Pre- & Post-Aramco IPO" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Managing-the-Big-Float-Saudi-Aramco-fig2.jpg" /></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><br />
The GCC region has abundant liquidity as evidenced during the recent IPO of National Commercial Bank (NCB) (region&rsquo;s largest) which raised USD 5.9bn in 2014. The IPO was heavily oversubscribed as retail investors placed orders worth more than 23 times the shares that Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s biggest bank by assets offered for sale. About 1.25 million people placed orders which cumulatively were worth USD 82.9bn for the retail portion of the offering (The wall street Journal). Thus, the Aramco issue could be listed in Tadawul exchange but it would exert tremendous pressure on the market liquidity in the days preceding the listing as potential investors would reduce their stakes in other holdings and save their money, to subscribe to this issue. Further, the stock regulator could accelerate reforms which could pave for inclusion of Tadawul index into MSCI indices. This could boost the market liquidity and increase investor participation ahead of the IPO sale and ensure its successful listing.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Further, one may consider dual-listing of Aramco in well-established stock exchanges such as New York or London apart from the domestic market. Though international listing could boost the confidence of investors and draw greater demand and investor attention for the offer it could entail enhanced disclosures of information and financials, which Saudi Arabia may be hesitant about.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
China is vouching for dual listing of Aramco that would put the government-owned oil giant&rsquo;s shares on both the Hong Kong and Saudi exchanges in return for anchor investments from the Chinese funds. Hong Kong exchange had IPOs worth USD 34bn last year surpassing USD 30bn raised by IPOs in U.S, and therefore winning the mandate could boost Hong Kong stature further. Moreover, 16% of Chinese oil imports are from Saudi Arabia; establishing a stake in Aramco could further increase the synergies between China and Saudi Arabia.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Alternatively, an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) could be setup and allowed for trading wherein the underlying asset is Saudi Aramco. This has the advantage of not ceding ownership and provides only the right to ownership over Aramco assets.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Listing of Aramco would be a landmark event not just for Saudi Arabia but for the global capital markets. Successful listing could pave way for trimming of government stakes in other large private entities. Considering liquidity pressures which the offer might experience in case of listing in the domestic market, it might be wise to consider other options which include dual listing. This will also boost the confidence of the foreign investors on the Saudi Arabian companies which might pave way for future listings of Saudi companies abroad.</div>[:ar]<img alt="Aramco IPO-Largest the world has ever seen" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Managing-the-Big-Float-Saudi-Aramco-fig1.jpg" /><br />

Gulf markets have been gaining for the past couple of months, on the back of strong oil market performance, with the belief that the oil price movements have turned a corner. Investor focus has now shifted to the corporate earnings that are affected by the austerity measures, which were undertaken due to low oil prices. The TASI index performance was largely due to companies beating their first-quarter earnings estimates, as well as the surge in oil prices. The combined net profits of Qatar&#39;s publicly traded firms stood at QR10.8bn for the first quarter of 2016, down 18.9% over 1Q15. Real Estate and Industries sectors led the rout falling by 62.5% and 18.6%, respectively.<br />
<br />
MENA markets liquidity had a negative month, with volumes decreasing by 11% and value traded falling by 5.1%. Oman and Kuwait witnessed increases in both volume and value traded, whereas the rest of the markets recorded declines in both. Volume and value traded in Oman increased by 61% and 42%, as investors responded to positive earnings season and rise in oil prices.<br />
<br />
Most Blue Chips ended the month of April in green, with Al Rajhi Bank (Saudi Arabia) topping the charts at 16.4%, as the company witnessed a 33% increase in quarterly earnings, mainly due to higher fee income. SABIC (KSA, 13.7%) and Emaar Properties (UAE, 13%) followed, as the former benefitted from rise in oil price, while the latter reported a 17% rise in earnings, despite weakening market conditions. Leading UAE banks witnessed large earnings decline in the first quarter, and most, with the exception of a few, reported rising pressures on key performance indicators such as loans and deposit growth, and asset quality in their first quarter results. Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (earnings, -18%), National Bank of Abu Dhabi (-11%), Commercial Bank of Dubai (-18%) were some of the big names on the list. ADCB and CBD witnessed a fall in operating income, because of drop in business volumes, while NBAD&rsquo;s incomes reflected lower investment gains and higher provisions.<br />
<br />
<strong>Global Oil News</strong><br />
OPEC and non-OPEC producers failed to reach a deal to freeze oil output at the Doha meeting in April, as OPEC members requested for more time to reach a deal among themselves, possibly at a June meeting, before striking one with other country producers.<br />
<br />
Kuwaiti oil and gas workers have ended a three-day strike that had temporarily cut the OPEC member&#39;s crude production by nearly half. The strike forced Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) to cut output to as little as 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd), down from a normal level of about 3 million bpd, as workers fear reduced salaries, benefits and staff layoffs will be part of a planned government overhaul of the payroll system in the public sector.<br />
<br />
According to Reuters, OPEC&#39;s oil output rose in April to close to the highest level in recent history, as production increases led by Iran and Iraq more than offset the strike in Kuwait and other disruptions. The region&rsquo;s top exporter, Saudi Arabia, made no major change to its output, despite the kingdom hinting it could boost supply after OPEC and non-member nations failed to reach an agreement earlier in the month.<br />
<br />
Despite the recent rally, oil markets remain oversupplied by about 1-2 million barrels of crude per day, which has led to global storage tanks filled to their rims with unsold fuel.<br />

<strong>Oil Market Review</strong><br />
Brent crude hit a high of USD 48 per barrel in the month of April, up 21.5% from March, the best monthly gain seen since May 2009. Weaker dollar and positive sentiment about the global supply glut easing raised crude oil futures by more than USD 20 per barrel, since witnessing 12 year lows of below USD 30 per barrel, in the first quarter. Oil price rose, despite OPEC and non-OPEC producers failing to reach a deal to freeze oil output.

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">According to an analysis by Marmore MENA Intelligence (<a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/">www.marmoremena.com</a>), a research house specialized in MENA economies and business issues with the focus on providing actionable solutions, out of a total of 121 UAE-listed stocks (comprising of ADX&rsquo;s 65, Nasdaq Dubai&rsquo's 5 and DFM&rsquo;s 52), 12 stocks are trading at multiples that are higher than their 5-year average PE multiples, which includes stocks such as Etisalat, du, Aramex, Commercial Bank of Dubai and RAK ceramics, among others. Likewise, out of 173 Saudi Tadawul-listed stocks, 28 of them still trade above their 5-year average PE multiples. &ldquo;In most cases, this has been due to decline in EPS rather than an increase in price, or a combination of both. In fact, almost all of the companies that have witnessed current PE greater than their five year average PE, have current EPS that is less than their five-year average EPS. Another crucial point is that there are no common companies in both these lists; no company with PE > 5-year average PE, is present in the EPS > 5-year EPS, or vice versa,&rdquo; M.R. Raghu, Managing Director, Marmore MENA Intelligence, told Wealth Monitor.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The report, shared exclusively with Wealth Monitor, includes only primary listings on both the exchanges (meaning stocks that are listed primarily in other stock exchanges and have a secondary listing on UAE or Tadawul have not been included). The report also shows that earnings of 8 companies in Tadawul are above their 5-year average, which includes names like Jarir Marketing, Alahli Takaful and National Agriculture Marketing, among others. In the case of UAE however no company had current EPS that is higher than its 5- year average. Whether the higher valuations of these stocks in UAE and KSA are justified or not is a subjective matter, what&rsquo;s striking is that these stocks have sailed against the tide at a time when Gulf equity markets have had to face the brunt of low crude oil prices.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The terms &lsquo;earnings multiple&rsquo;, &lsquo;Price to Earnings ratio&rsquo;, or PE ratio mean the same and is perhaps the most frequently used benchmark for evaluating the outlook of a stock. To interpret it simply, if a stock trades at 12 times its earnings, your share, as an investor and shareholder, of the profits for each of the stock you own is equal to 1/12th of the stock&rsquo;s value. However, analysts reckon, the PE ratio shouldn&rsquo;t be viewed in isolation and shouldn&rsquo;t be the sole criterion for buying or selling a stock, as various other factors should also be factored into. The price relative to earnings is impacted by the growth rate of a company. A company with a high growth rate will cause a high price of its stock, and naturally a high P/E ratio. This means high growth companies have high P/E multiple while low growth rate companies have low P/E ratios.<br />

Whether the higher valuations of these stocks in UAE and KSA are justified or not is a subjective matter, what&rsquo;s striking is that these stocks have sailed against the tide at a time when Gulf equity markets have had to face the brunt of low crude oil prices.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The terms &lsquo;earnings multiple&rsquo;, &lsquo;Price to Earnings ratio&rsquo;, or PE ratio mean the same and is perhaps the most frequently used benchmark for evaluating the outlook of a stock. To interpret it simply, if a stock trades at 12 times its earnings, your share, as an investor and shareholder, of the profits for each of the stock you own is equal to 1/12th of the stock&rsquo;s value. However, analysts reckon, the PE ratio shouldn&rsquo;t be viewed in isolation and shouldn&rsquo;t be the sole criterion for buying or selling a stock, as various other factors should also be factored into. The price relative to earnings is impacted by the growth rate of a company. A company with a high growth rate will cause a high price of its stock, and naturally a high P/E ratio. This means high growth companies have high P/E multiple while low growth rate companies have low P/E ratios.<br />

		<Title>[:en]GCC stock markets: Where is the research?[:ar]أسواق أسهم دول مجلس التعاون الخليجي: أين البحث؟[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">Compared to most developed and emerging markets, the Gulf Cooperation Council&rsquo;s stock markets suffer from poor research coverage.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The four largest GCC equity markets together enjoy less than a third of the research coverage of other regions, with that available often restricted to large stocks, leaving mid-cap and small-cap stocks mostly ignored from the spectrum.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In the GCC, the major producers of research are a handful of domestic banks and investment houses, which have research as an auxiliary function focusing predominantly on the sell-side segment.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
A lack of international players and independent research houses has led to limited research offerings. In the <em>Reuters </em>database, since the beginning of 2015, there have been 17 reports on SABIC (market cap $61.6bn), the biggest company in the GCC, compared with 155 reports on Tata Consultancy Services (India, market cap $69.3bn) and 303 on Apple Inc. (United States, market cap $560.2bn).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The number of analysts following SABIC, TCS and Apple Inc. are 14, 51 and 47 respectively, showing the extent to which research coverage lags behind in the Gulf region.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The predominant consumers of research &ndash; funds and companies &ndash; are a minority in the regional stock exchanges, accounting for less than 30 per cent of the value traded. Retail investors in some countries account for more than 70 to 80 per cent of the liquidity.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
While this compares well with China, where about 85 per cent of trades are retail, in India over 70 per cent of market liquidity occurs due to foreign institutional investors. The retail investors in the developed markets account for only 10 to 30 per cent of liquidity and the institutional investors account for the rest.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Therefore, the important factors that determine the extent of analyst research coverage in a country are the proportion of institutional investors, breadth and depth of the markets, extent of foreign investment, number of players in the market and, finally, transparency and openness to sharing forward-looking statements by companies.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The overwhelming presence of retail investors has led to investments that are primarily driven by sentiment, speculation and word-of-mouth information rather than analytical research. This has led to increased market volatility compared to developed markets.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The top-heavy nature of the GCC markets, along with low liquidity and lack of investor interest in the mid and small-cap segments, has resulted in dwindling analyst research in these segments.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The lack of availability of analyst write-ups in Arabic has again led to low consumption of research in the region.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Another reason for low research focus is the uneven corporate disclosures across the GCC region, where some countries lag behind others during regular filings of financial results.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Delays in acquiring time-sensitive information and minimal public disclosures discourage analysts from following companies, as some countries seem to have relatively more lenient regulations. Also, declaration of financial results is dependent on the size of the companies, with large-cap companies releasing information at a faster rate, compared to mid-cap and small-cap companies. The region also lags behind its peers in developed and emerging markets in the strict enforcement of corporate governance rules and stock exchange rules, which has led to markets that are relatively inefficient.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Among GCC countries, the extent of analyst coverage varies based on the above defined factors. For example, coverage is the highest in Saudi Arabia, followed by Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait. Barring Qatar, all other major GCC nations have over 88 per cent analyst coverage for large-cap stocks, due to the popularity of these stocks among the investors and the relatively higher amount of research and information available in the public domain.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This coverage value declines for mid-cap companies and falls further for small-cap companies. Despite its popularity as a financial hub, the UAE lags behind Saudi Arabia and Qatar in terms of analyst coverage of its markets, with just over one-third of the stocks covered by analysts.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
While in other markets it is common to find more than five analysts covering large cap stocks, in the GCC such luxuries are restricted only to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. This is not surprising given the overall low flow of research.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Post the global financial crisis, GCC capital market regulators have tightened regulations concerning disclosures and other matters. These disclosures happen mostly on a bilateral basis with companies providing huge amounts of information to regulators but not disseminated freely for analysts to pore over. Increased regulations also add to compliance costs, which can be onerous for small and medium-sized listed stocks thereby encouraging them to delist.<br />
Many GCC countries are in the process of improving the efficiency of exchange operations to attract more liquidity. If the rules are properly regulated and enforced, disclosures and filings will occur in a timely manner that would enable timely research to be conducted and draw investor interest. Practices that favor a select group of investor owners at the expense of minority shareholders need to be curbed and minority investors protected, to enhance institutional investor participation.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Market limits must be drawn to ensure that daily volatility on any instrument is controlled. Investment companies must also come under strict regulation to ensure control over leveraged positions, and protection of investor interests. A number of new regulations have been issued to improve market attractiveness, but the strict enforcement of corporate governance and exchange rules is necessary to improve research coverage of the country&rsquo;s stocks.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The GCC stock markets are inherently more volatile than their emerging market peers, primarily due to the nascent stage of development. Therefore, managing this risk or volatility is a key criteria for institutional investor entry. A buy and hold environment may not enable this. Availability of broader tools like derivatives (options and futures) can provide the needed tools for managing volatility. Additionally, a framework for stock lending and short selling practices needs to be developed. Such measures can reduce market volatility and attract foreign investors, who can then propagate a research culture.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Consolidated, bigger markets would help to increase market liquidity and limit volatility. This would enhance confidence for market participants and consequently provide an attractive destination for international institutional investors. In addition, it would aid the research industry as analysts would be able to conduct research on a larger pool of stocks with more comparable companies.<br />

		<Title>[:en]MENA Markets March on Oil Rise[:ar]شهدت أسواق الشرق الأوسط وشمال أفريقيا ارتفاعًا في أسعار النفط في شهر مارس[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="MENA Market Trends – March 2016" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MMR-April-Blog-Fig1.jpg" /><br />
Egypt&rsquo;s stocks rose in March, as the country&rsquo;s central bank devalued its currency and stated that it would adopt a more flexible exchange-rate policy, to ease an acute dollar shortage that is hurting the economy. The devaluation, along with other measures, made stocks cheaper for both domestic and foreign investors, who went on a purchasing binge. The exchange closed the month at 687 points, up from 560 points in February, in what has been the single largest monthly gain in over eight years. Strong buying activity by foreign institutions and reduced net selling by domestic investors, especially in the small and large cap segments, lifted Qatari index by close to 5% in March. For GCC markets, rising oil price and stabilizing China provided cheer for investors in March.<br />
<br />
MENA markets liquidity had a positive month, with volumes increasing by 26% and value traded rising by 5.5%. Egypt, Dubai, Qatar and Morocco witnessed increases in both volume and value traded, while Abu Dhabi, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia were the only markets to record declines in both. Volume and value traded in Egypt increased by 104% and 93%, respectively, while the Abu Dhabi witnessed a 34% volume and 12.5% value drop.<br />
<br />
Most Blue Chips ended the month of March in green, with Ezdan Holding (Qatar) topping the charts at 18.5%, as the company benefitted from the rise in oil price in March. DP World (UAE, 10.7%) and Americana (Kuwait, 7.9%) followed Ezdan, at the top of the table. The former obtained Indian government approval for reorganizing into a merged entity, and announced plans for an IPO for this new holding firm, while shares of the latter grew almost 8%, despite posting 14.8% fall in its Q4 net profit. Americana found a bidder, Adeptio LLC, backed by a consortium of banks, including Citigroup Inc. and Standard Chartered Plc, who have pledged USD 1.5bn for this deal. Banks had a rough month with FGB (-7.8%), Al Rajhi (-3.7%) and NBK (-3.6%) falling the most among blue chips. FGB, the largest lender by market value in the UAE, won shareholder approval to issue debt early in March. Also, the credit crisis among SMEs in the UAE, has put pressure on banks to restructure loans.<br />
<br />
<strong>GCC Legal, Regulatory and Market Actions</strong><br />
Banks in the United Arab Emirates will suspend legal action against small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) struggling to repay debt for up to three months to prevent a surge in defaults that may jeopardize the economy. The rescue initiative launched by the banking industry to halt criminal prosecutions for bounced cheques, is a major departure for the UAE&rsquo;s financial system, which relies on paper cheques as security in business transactions.<br />
<br />
Saudi Arabia&#39;s central bank will allow mortgage companies to supply a greater share of funding for home purchases, raising the maximum permitted contribution to 85 per cent from 70 per cent of the value of the house. In December, the bank licensed a national home finance company, Bidaya, and in February, it introduced an "affordable mortgage" programme through which the Ministry of Finance would guarantee 15 percent of the financing for a home purchase.<br />
<br />
Bahrain&#39;s stock exchange has established a market for real estate investment trusts (REITs). Under the plan, REITs licensed by the central bank can be listed and traded by investors in the secondary market. REITs are common in many markets, but are relatively new to the Middle East, with Emirates REIT becoming the regions first in April 2014. Saudi Arabia&#39;s Capital Market Authority (CMA) is also studying plans to introduce rules governing the listing of REITs.<br />
<br />
<strong>Oil Market Review</strong><br />
Brent crude hit a high of USD 42 per barrel before closing the month at just below USD 40 per barrel, up 10.1% from February. Brent crude rose over talks of a consensus being reached by major oil producers to freeze production levels. Despite Iran&rsquo;s reservations, other oil producers expressed optimism at the deal being finalized. &nbsp;However, concerns about oversupply, and a bearish supply signal from Saudi and Kuwait pulled down the gains in the last week of March.</div>[:ar]<div style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="MENA Market Trends – March 2016" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MMR-April-Blog-Fig1.jpg" /><br />

		<Title>[:en]All-Time Highs - Kuwait 15 Index Stocks[:ar]شهد مؤشر أسهم كويت 15 ارتفاعًا قياسيًا[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">

Instead of analyzing the index we are going to  analyze performance on a stock level and measure the divergence from the recorded all-time highs (ATH) of the respective stocks since fundamentally sound stocks (good top and bottom line growth, sound management etc.) consistently establish new ATH’s reflecting growth and opportunities. While stagnant companies may struggle to re-conquer their ATH’s and can thus test investor patience (Japan for e.g.).

Looking at Kuwait 15 Index constituents, the only positive news comes from the newly added stocks Mezzan (listed in 2015) and VIVA (listed in 2014). For VIVA the difference between the all-time high and 2015 closing price was -10% and the last ATH occurred 18 days before the year ended in 2015 while Mezzan holding lost only 2% from its ATH which occurred 9 days before the year ended. Although the two stocks feature in our note on account of being a part of the Kuwait 15 Index, we will exclude them from analysis due to its recent listings.
</div>
<img style="width: 766px; height: 450px;" title="Kuwait_table1.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/All-Time-Highs-fig1.jpg" alt="Kuwait_table1.jpg" />
<div style="text-align: justify;">

Looking at the list above<a title="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[2]</a> only one company (Kuwait Food) achieved its ATH in the last 2 years and only 2 companies posted their all-time  3 years back (Mabanee and Boubyan bank). Looking at Mabanee we can see that the stock is hovering 8% below its all-time high, while Boubyan Bank is trading 24% below its all-time high. Apart from the 3 companies mentioned above, 8 companies in the Kuwait 15 index posted their all-time highs between 7 and 9 years ago and they are trading in a range of -86% to -44% of their all-time high prices.
Looking at the table above we could clearly see the impact of market mania during the bull market of 2004-2008, 10 out of 15 companies in the index reached their all-time high during this period. During market bubbles investors usually believe that stocks can only go up, thus we see stocks reaching all-time highs without being backed by strong fundamentals. That said the companies on the list are among the largest in the Kuwait stock exchange and are operational in nature compared to small capitalized companies and an uptick in the economic environment will most likely enhance growth.

The top loser in terms of number of years in our study is Agility; the company posted its all-time high in 2005, almost 11 years ago, and is currently trading 82% below its all-time high and needs to gain 448% just to catch up with its ATH. The top loser in terms of gap between the ATH and current prices is Zain. At the end of 2015, Zain traded 86% below its all-time high of KWD2.538 which means that for it to close the gap, the price of Zain’s stock must increase by 625%!

It is important for bellwether stocks to touch new highs and not languish on old glory. Stocks touch new highs primarily on performance though speculation cannot be ruled out. While speculation can set the fire, the continuance depends on fundamental performance. Being part of Kuwait 15, these stocks enjoy high liquidity and patronage from institutional investors as well. They are well covered by analysts (relative to the whole market). While constructing a portfolio/investment strategy, it is important to note whether stocks are touching new highs. It is better to avoid stocks that came away a long mile from their historic highs and shows no signs of getting there. While these stocks will still be part of index funds or ETF’s, they need not be part of an active portfolio strategy.

<div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Valuation: Positive</strong><br />
&nbsp;Price-to-earnings multiple for UAE fell by 13% in 2015 and currently stands at 10.4x. The fall has been the most in Dubai index, wherein, the P/E multiple contracted by 25% from 12.4x at the start of year to a current value of 9.3x. UAE markets seem attractive for investors with P/E ratio of 10.4 while its comparable peers Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are slightly overvalued at 14.4 and 13 respectively. On P/B basis, UAE (1.3) is slightly overvalued than Kuwait (1.1) yet attractive compared to Saudi Arabia (1.5) and Qatar (1.6). The drop in stock prices due to unfavourable investor sentiments was the reason for valuations to decline after 2013. Dividend yield forecast for UAE also remains attractive at 4.2%.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Earnings: Positive</strong><br />
We expect corporate earnings growth to be flat in 2015 and gradually grow by 5.1% in 2016 led by banking sector. According to Marmore&rsquo;s UAE stock market outlook for 2016, while the lower oil prices could affect the deposit mobilization process and subsequently the credit off-take, we believe the banks are well-capitalized and enjoy ample liquidity to minimize risks posed by the lower oil environment. We expect the earnings in UAE to grow by 5% next year as the banking sector which constitutes about 80% of the corporate earnings is expected to witness 5% growth in 2016. Earnings from the banking sector can push the earnings to grow in 2016 despite the declines anticipated for telecom and real estate companies. CBRE predicts the real estate prices in Dubai and Abu Dhabi to fall further in 2016. Lower ARPU (Average rate per user) in UAE may hit the top line of the telecom companies.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Economy: Neutral</strong><br />
GDP growth in UAE is expected to be moderate (3.3%) in 2016 on account of scale back in public spending, especially in Abu Dhabi, on account of lower oil prices. Catalysts in the form of hosting Expo 2020 and lifting of sanctions in Iran could boost investment and trade activity in the coming years. UAE&rsquo;s large reserves will help them to intensify the diversification process and focus on non-oil driven growth for the future. The lower projection for UAE is mainly due to the lower activity in Abu Dhabi from where the country receives the major chunk of oil output. UAE economy is expected to see sluggish growth activity till 2017 and move towards higher growth trajectory after 2017. Inflation in UAE is expected to ease at 3% 2016 compared to 3.7% in 2015 as the cost of transportation and fuel have declined with the decline in oil price. Diesel prices have declined by 18.2% in 2015. UAE however stands next to Kuwait among the GCC countries with Oman&rsquo;s inflation expected to be the lowest at 2%.<br />
<br />
<strong>Market Liquidity: Neutral</strong><br />
Value traded in UAE markets plunged by 66% Y-o-Y in 2015 after its 248% and 124% increase in 2013 and 2014 mainly due to the country entering the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. The declining stock prices owing to sell-off spree from the institutional investor and fund managers was the major reason for the decline in value traded in UAE.</div>
<br />
<img alt="UAE_fig3.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/UAE-Stock-Market-Outlook-2016-fig3.jpg" style="width: 609px; height: 386px;" title="UAE_fig3.jpg" />
<div style="text-align: justify;">Stock turnover ratio stood at 25% in 2015 as value traded for the year fell by 66% to USD 50bn from USD 150bn registered a year back. 2014 being the year of UAE inclusion in MSCI Emerging Market Index witnessed hectic investor activity. The declining stock prices owing to sell-off spree from the institutional investor and fund managers was the major reason for the decline in value traded in UAE. We expect stock turnover ratio to increase to 49% in 2016 with SCA making changes to cope with the new low liquidity levels and attract more investors. The safe haven status of UAE helps to bring more wealth into the economy which in turn can increase the investments in equity. UAE&rsquo;s market conditions are better than its peers except Saudi Arabia, where the liquidity positions have improved.<br />
<br />
<strong>Concluding Remarks</strong><br />
In sum, we believe that 2 out of 4 factors are Positive for UAE with the others being Neutral and hence we will continue to maintain our positive stance on the UAE market. The four-force analysis depicts the strength of the UAE economy especially in terms of valuation and earnings potential. Economic factors such as the positive trade balance, robust GDP growth and lower levels of inflation provide cushion to the economy despite the drop in government revenues. Valuations for UAE stocks remain attractive for investors compared to markets like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. P/E ratio of UAE was 9.3 in 2015 compared to 14.4 in Kuwait. We expect the valuations in the UAE market to remain attractive in 2016. Liquidity in the markets is also expected to improve as value of stocks traded is anticipated to move upwards in 2016 with better earnings forecasted. UAE market is expected to remain resilient to the oil shock with the reforms of the government such as subsidy cut and fiscal consolidation expected to pay-off from 2016.</div>[:ar]<img alt="UAE_fig1.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/UAE-Stock-Market-Outlook-2016-fig1.jpg" style="width: 614px; height: 589px;" title="UAE_fig1.jpg" />

<div style="text-align: justify;">Price-to-earnings multiple for Qatar has fallen by 25% and currently stands at 11.1x. Qatar market is relatively undervalued when compared to the markets of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Investor interest in the market waned post 2014 owing to poor international conditions. Qatar also has the highest dividend yield in the region at 5.1%. We expect corporate earnings growth to be slightly negative in 2016. Earnings are expected to slightly reduce as infrastructure spending peaks. Real estate and commodities sector in Qatar are expected to be worst hit with their earnings expected to decline by -10% and -15% respectively. Declining oil and gas prices could affect the commodities sector.

Growth in Qatar is expected to be moderate (4.9% Real GDP growth for 2016) on account of calculated spending cuts. Qatar, in its recent budget has announced to reduce the budget spending by 7.28% to $ 55 Bn. Major infrastructure spending has been left untouched with the spending cuts expected to affect in the excess in state-funded organizations such as Qatar Museums, Qatar Foundation and Al Jazeera. Stock turnover ratio stood at 13% in 2015 as value traded for the year fell by 56% to USD 23bn from USD 41bn registered a year back. Qatar has a long way to go to reach KSA’s turnover levels of 93%. 2014 being the year of Qatar’s inclusion in MSCI Emerging Market Index witnessed hectic investor activity. Consequently, the fall in value traded could be a result of foreign investment cap for stocks being already met and no further scope for fresh investments.

Qatar index, which was majorly flat until June 2015, started declining in the latter half of the year. GCC markets were rocked by the fall in Chinese equities which resulted in region wide selling. Uncertainty over oil prices and political situation in the region only helped to exacerbate the problem. Qatar market fell sharply in November 2015; Qatar lost -13.0%.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">

<strong>Valuation: Positive</strong>
According to Qatar’s stock market outlook for 2016, On a standalone P/E basis, Qatar, with a ratio of 11.1x of the earnings, appears to trade at lower valuation level compared to peers such as KSA & Kuwait. On P/B basis Qatar market is the most expensive among all GCC nations at 1.6x. Dividend yield for Qatar stands at 5.1% which is the highest among GCC along with Bahrain. On an overall basis, we adopt a positive view on Qatar.

<strong>Corporate Earnings: Negative</strong>
At the start of 2016, we expect overall earnings growth to be marginally negative at -0.6%. While Qatar has been diversifying its source of revenues, the payoff from them is not expected to be immediate. Banks and construction related sectors alone are expected to post positive earnings in 2016, the former owing to the strong local consumption demand and credit growth, the latter owing to the huge infrastructure spending that the Qatar government has been undertaking in its preparation for the Football World Cup in 2022.On a overall level we expect the earnings growth to be subdued in 2016 and hence hold a neutral view.

<strong>Economy: Neutral</strong>
Real GDP growth in Qatar is expected to be only slightly better in 2016, on the back of increased infrastructure spending that the government has planned as part of its bid for the 2022 Football World Cup. Qatar has earmarked a total of $229 Bn to be spent on the projects, which includes construction of a new city, a rail network and a mega reservoirs project.

<strong>Market Liquidity: Negative</strong>
Global factors were also not favorable during 2015 resulting in a wide-spread sell-off in the region post the Chinese stock market crash in June. MSCI upgraded Qatar to emerging market last year and it was also included in the MSCI emerging market index last year. Unfortunately this upgrade alone has not been sufficient enough to increase the turnover in the Qatar market.

The initial euphoria surrounding the inclusion at the beginning of 2015 faded away as poor investor sentiment coupled with the drop in oil price, regional instability and turmoil in Chinese equities forced international investors to review their strategies. We expect 2016 to be much better on account of the positive steps taken by the Qatar stock exchange on issues such as stock lending and short selling.

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<img style="width: 649px; height: 179px;" title="fig1.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/KSA-Stock-Market-Outlook-2016-fig1.jpg" alt="fig1.jpg" />

<img style="width: 614px; height: 387px;" title="fig2.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/KSA-Stock-Market-Outlook-2016-fig2.jpg" alt="fig2.jpg" />
<div style="text-align: justify;">

Majority of the sectors underperformed during 2015, with Media & Publication, Transport, Energy and Utilities and Real Estate being the exceptions. According to Marmore’s KSA stock market outlook 2016, Saudi construction and cement were the worst hit sectors as they lost 34% and 30% respectively. The decline in banking sector index by 14.9% during 2015 establishes the challenges in the form of liquidity tightening, as a consequence of low oil prices and increased government borrowings that will impact the banking sector.

<img style="width: 632px; height: 488px;" title="fig3.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/KSA-Stock-Market-Outlook-2016-fig3.jpg" alt="fig3.jpg" />
Going forward, we evaluate the attractiveness of the KSA stock market based on four-factor model.

<strong>1. Valuation: Neutral</strong>
On a standalone basis, KSA, with a P/E ratio of 13x appears to trade at elevated valuation levels, given that MSCI emerging markets constituents UAE and Qatar were trading at a lower premium. On P/B basis, KSA market is the second expensive among all GCC nations after Qatar.  Dividend yield for KSA stands at 4.2%.

<img style="width: 580px; height: 354px;" title="fig4.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/KSA-Stock-Market-Outlook-2016-fig4.jpg" alt="fig4.jpg" />

<strong>2. Corporate Earnings: Negative</strong>
The continued expected lower oil price in 2016 is expected to exert further pressure on corporate earnings. Lower credit offtake and increasing cost of funds due to liquidity squeeze is expected to impact the bank earnings. The large petrochemical segment of KSA is expected to contract due to lower price realization of its products, resulting in almost 15% decline in earnings for companies operating in the commodities segment in 2016 compared to 2015. The lower anticipated growth rate is likely to translate into flat growth rate for real estate sector and result in contraction of the construction related sectors.

<img style="width: 636px; height: 355px;" title="fig5-(1).jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/KSA-Stock-Market-Outlook-2016-fig5.jpg" alt="fig5-(1).jpg" />

<strong>3. Economy: Neutral</strong>
Saudi Arabia’s GDP is projected to grow at 3.4% in 2015, a drop from previous year growth of 3.5%. The GDP growth is expected to slow down to 2.2% in 2016. Non-hydrocarbon sector growth is expected to be the slowest at 3.8% during 2016 and this is the least growth level in the last five years. The current account deficit is estimated to increase to 4.7% of GDP in 2016 and fiscal deficit during 2016 is expected to reduce compared to 2015 levels. The inflation in KSA is expected to be at 2.3% in 2016 by IMF.

<strong>4. Market Liquidity: Positive</strong>
Aggregate value traded of equities in KSA reached a value of USD 461.6bn in 2015. This represents a 15% lower value from the value traded registered in 2014. The drop in value traded can be attributed to lean trading triggered by the negative investor sentiment due to lower oil prices. However, this is expected to marginally increase to 93% of market cap during 2016.
The trading activity on Tadawul is dominated by the retail investors with the institutional investors contributing only 9% of trading volume on Tadawul exchange. However, with the relaxation of rules with regards to foreign investment in Tadawul, this institutional investment can be expected to grow. The stock market turnover ratio for KSA has been consistenly high compared to the other GCC markets. The KSA market liquidity is expected to remain high during 2016 as well.

<img style="width: 629px; height: 292px;" title="fig6.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/KSA-Stock-Market-Outlook-2016-fig6.jpg" alt="fig6.jpg" />

<strong>Concluding Remarks</strong>
Based on the four force analysis, the 2016 outlook for KSA is “Neutral”. Due to its strong reserves and low levels of debt, KSA will manage to weather low oil price era without significant troubles. However, this would certainly slow the economic engines to a certain extent which will be reflected in the corporate earning during 2016. The low investor confidence will reflect in the valuation of the stocks. However, KSA will continue to be a highly liquid market in the region and participation of Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors (QFIIs) will complement the existing liquidity status of the market.

<div style="text-align: justify;">

Majority of the sectors underperformed during 2015, with Media & Publication, Transport, Energy and Utilities and Real Estate being the exceptions. According to Marmore’s KSA stock market outlook 2016, Saudi construction and cement were the worst hit sectors as they lost 34% and 30% respectively. The decline in banking sector index by 14.9% during 2015 establishes the challenges in the form of liquidity tightening, as a consequence of low oil prices and increased government borrowings that will impact the banking sector.

<img style="width: 632px; height: 488px;" title="fig3.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/KSA-Stock-Market-Outlook-2016-fig3.jpg" alt="fig3.jpg" />
Going forward, we evaluate the attractiveness of the KSA stock market based on four-factor model.

<strong>1. Valuation: Neutral</strong>
On a standalone basis, KSA, with a P/E ratio of 13x appears to trade at elevated valuation levels, given that MSCI emerging markets constituents UAE and Qatar were trading at a lower premium. On P/B basis, KSA market is the second expensive among all GCC nations after Qatar.  Dividend yield for KSA stands at 4.2%.

<img style="width: 580px; height: 354px;" title="fig4.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/KSA-Stock-Market-Outlook-2016-fig4.jpg" alt="fig4.jpg" />

<strong>2. Corporate Earnings: Negative</strong>
The continued expected lower oil price in 2016 is expected to exert further pressure on corporate earnings. Lower credit offtake and increasing cost of funds due to liquidity squeeze is expected to impact the bank earnings. The large petrochemical segment of KSA is expected to contract due to lower price realization of its products, resulting in almost 15% decline in earnings for companies operating in the commodities segment in 2016 compared to 2015. The lower anticipated growth rate is likely to translate into flat growth rate for real estate sector and result in contraction of the construction related sectors.

<strong>3. Economy: Neutral</strong>
Saudi Arabia’s GDP is projected to grow at 3.4% in 2015, a drop from previous year growth of 3.5%. The GDP growth is expected to slow down to 2.2% in 2016. Non-hydrocarbon sector growth is expected to be the slowest at 3.8% during 2016 and this is the least growth level in the last five years. The current account deficit is estimated to increase to 4.7% of GDP in 2016 and fiscal deficit during 2016 is expected to reduce compared to 2015 levels. The inflation in KSA is expected to be at 2.3% in 2016 by IMF.

<strong>4. Market Liquidity: Positive</strong>
Aggregate value traded of equities in KSA reached a value of USD 461.6bn in 2015. This represents a 15% lower value from the value traded registered in 2014. The drop in value traded can be attributed to lean trading triggered by the negative investor sentiment due to lower oil prices. However, this is expected to marginally increase to 93% of market cap during 2016.
The trading activity on Tadawul is dominated by the retail investors with the institutional investors contributing only 9% of trading volume on Tadawul exchange. However, with the relaxation of rules with regards to foreign investment in Tadawul, this institutional investment can be expected to grow. The stock market turnover ratio for KSA has been consistenly high compared to the other GCC markets. The KSA market liquidity is expected to remain high during 2016 as well.

<img style="width: 629px; height: 292px;" title="fig6.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/KSA-Stock-Market-Outlook-2016-fig6.jpg" alt="fig6.jpg" />

<strong>Concluding Remarks</strong>
Based on the four force analysis, the 2016 outlook for KSA is “Neutral”. Due to its strong reserves and low levels of debt, KSA will manage to weather low oil price era without significant troubles. However, this would certainly slow the economic engines to a certain extent which will be reflected in the corporate earning during 2016. The low investor confidence will reflect in the valuation of the stocks. However, KSA will continue to be a highly liquid market in the region and participation of Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors (QFIIs) will complement the existing liquidity status of the market.

Qatar&rsquo;s 2016 budget, which includes cut in expenditures in anticipation of the country&rsquo;s first fiscal shortfall in 15 years, was released on 16th December 2015. Expenditures are forecasted at $55.6bn next year, which is a 7.3% decline from the last fiscal year, despite the increase in outlays on government salaries, wages and major projects &ndash; such as major transportation initiatives and preparations for the 2022 World Cup. Saudi Arabia unveiled a $223.8bn budget, as the Kingdom attempts to further diversify its revenues in an era of low oil prices. The government incurred a deficit of $97.9bn (15% of GDP in 2015), and with the 2016 budget it aims to cut that to $86.9bn. Spending has been forecasted to decline to $224bn, down from the $260bn actually spent in 2015.&nbsp; Efforts are being undertaken to ensure government projects are more efficient, necessary and affordable. Omani government expenditures and revenues for 2016 are estimated at $30.9bn and $22.3bn, respectively, leading to an estimated deficit of $8.6bn, lesser than the $11.7bn deficit expected for 2015.

		<Title>[:en]Top 20 GCC Mutual Funds 2015[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">GCC markets are yet to recover following their retreat amid weaker oil prices. Saudi Arabia stocks were affected the most on concerns of deteriorating fiscal position and sustainability of finances. Saudi Index (TASI) declined by 16.6% YTD registering the highest loss among all GCC markets. The Dubai general index registered a loss of 14.6% as investors booked profits amid low international investor participation. Tepid earnings, negative investor sentiments following China crisis and impending U.S Fed hike continue to drag down the GCC markets with all closing in red.</div>
<img title="Fig1.png" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Top-20-GCC-Mutual-Funds-2015-fig1.jpg" alt="Fig1.png" width="550" height="459" />
<div style="text-align: justify;">

Market liquidity has fallen in 2015 to USD 464 bn (YTD – October 2015), due to the declining investor confidence in the GCC markets and low trading activity, after reaching a 5- year high of USD 771 bn in 2014 and 10-year high of USD 1,618 bn in 2006. Since June 2014, the fall in oil price continued to have a big impact on the markets and investor sentiments. Investors worry whether the decline in revenues is going to affect government spending, which in turn will affect the earning potential of the corporates. The Chinese sell off and struggling Eurozone markets have further exacerbated the negative sentiments. After a stellar 2014, which witnessed 14 new issues worth USD 9.7bn, including the listing of NCB, the largest IPO in the region, 2015 has turned out dull for companies seeking funding from public. Until October ’15, only 4 issues have been listed, worth a relatively paltry USD 1.2bn. Most companies are staying away from the volatile GCC markets, due to the down trending oil price and weak global markets.

In terms of valuation, P/E of Kuwait (14.2x) market was at premium among the GCC markets while the markets of Bahrain (8.7x), Oman (9.7x) and Dubai (10x) were the least priced markets. Saudi Arabia (1.7x) and Qatar (1.7x) continue to remain relatively overvalued in terms of P/B compared with Bahrain (0.9x) and Kuwait (1.1x). The valuation ratios for nearly all countries declined as the stock markets across the region decreased in value. Weak investor sentiments due to global equity and commodity markets slowing down after H2, 2014 coupled with prolonged low oil price was the main reason for decline in the valuation ratios.

<strong>GCC Mutual Funds Analysis:</strong>
<strong>Based on Size: </strong>The GCC mutual fund industry comprises of 225 active mutual funds, out of which 135 were Islamic and the remaining 90 were conventional funds, with AuM of USD 29.84 Bn. Based on the size, the top 20 funds comprised 15 Islamic funds, the top 5 being Islamic money market funds. RiyadC- Riyad Equity Fund managed by Riyad Capital was the largest conventional equity fund with size of USD 594.15 Mn and Saudi Fransi Saudi Riyal Money Market fund from Saudi Fransi Capital was the largest conventional money market fund accounting for USD 370.57 Mn. Among the specialized conventional funds, Samba Real Estate fund of Samba Capital and Investment Management Company (USD 543.63 Mn) was the largest. The fund sizes of the Islamic funds in GCC were comparatively higher than the conventional funds. Among the Islamic funds, the HSBC Saudi Companies Equity fund was the largest equity fund with size USD 622.8 Mn. AlAhli Saudi Riyal Trade fund, which is a money market fund, managed by NCB Capital with size of USD 4,576.28 Mn was the largest fund in the GCC.

<strong>Methodology Followed for Ranking the Mutual Funds:</strong>

</div>
<ol>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Analysis includes those funds which has GCC region and its constituent countries as their geographic focus. These funds may/ may not be domiciled within GCC.</li>

&nbsp;
<div style="text-align: justify;">MENA markets liquidity continued its momentum in November, with volume increasing by 20% and value traded by 7.7%, post the lulled market activity in the last quarter. With the exception of Oman and Jordan, other MENA markets witnessed rise in market liquidity, with Bahrain, Kuwait, and the UAE leading the charge. Bahrain showed the most improvement with value traded increasing by 268% and volume traded increasing by 167%, after being the worst hit in Oct&rsquo;15.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
SABIC (KSA) was the top performing blue chip, gaining 9.1% in November, followed by Emirates Telecom (UAE) and Saudi Telecom (KSA), which gained 7.8% and 4.7%, respectively. Despite SABIC&rsquo;s Q3 profit falling 9.4% to USD 1.5bn, the company was able to beat analyst estimates by cutting operational costs. Also, SABIC estimates chemical prices to either remain stable or increase in 2016, as China&rsquo;s economic growth is expected to improve, thereby driving oil demand. The company is also eyeing overseas acquisition to expand its markets geographically. Emirates Telecom has benefited from its decision to allow foreign and institutional investors to own its shares and has rallied since the announcement made during the previous quarter. Qatari companies, Industries Qatar (-18.3%), Ezdan Holdings (-18.0%) and Masraf Al Rayan (-17.4%) were the top three losers in November, as they were affected by the rebalancing of the MSCI emerging markets index and the fall in hydrocarbon price.<br />
<br />
Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s cut its ratings for Saudi Arabia&#39;s long-term foreign and local currency sovereign credit to &#39;A-plus/A-1&#39;, citing a &quot;pronounced negative swing&quot; in the government&#39;s budget balance. S&amp;P kept its outlook for the ratings negative, saying it could lower them further in the next two years unless the government managed a large and sustained cut in its deficit. &nbsp;Moody&rsquo;s has now warned Saudi Arabia of its weakening fiscal position, while keeping its rating unchanged. Saudi Arabian corporate earnings declined during Q3 2015 as low oil prices pulled down the wider economy. Cumulative net income at 166 listed companies dropped 14% from a year earlier to USD 7.4bn.<br />
<br />
Saudi Arabia&#39;s cabinet recently stated that it was ready to cooperate with OPEC and non-OPEC countries to achieve market stability, before OPEC met on Dec 4 to review its year-long policy of not supporting prices. But the OPEC members were not able to agree on a production ceiling as Iran wanted to scale back its production to levels prior to western sanctions before it considers production curb, which led to further decline in oil price. The market remains over-supplied, with production having risen to a record 97.09mbpd.</div>[:]]]></Content>

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<img title="table1.png" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Reasons-for-poor-Analyst-Coverage-in-Kuwait-fig1.jpg" alt="table1.png" width="295" height="116" />

<strong>The present scenario</strong>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

Compared to all other stock exchanges in the GCC the number of large- and mid- cap stocks, as per the above definition, is much lower in Kuwait, than in peer countries, whereas the number of small-cap stocks is over 91% of the market. Qatar has the most even cap divide, while Kuwait sits at the other end of the spectrum. In terms of analyst coverage (as a percentage of all stocks in the exchange), Kuwait is the lowest at 8.1%, while Saudi is the highest at close to 49.7%. For Qatar and the UAE analyst coverage ranges stands at 42% and 30%, respectively. Looking at the cap-wise analyst coverage, other than Qatar (64%), all other GCC nations have over 90% analyst coverage for large-cap stocks, due to the popularity of these stocks among the investors and the relatively higher amount of research and information available in the public domain. This coverage value decreases for mid-cap companies, with a high of 91% seen for Saudi Arabia, and a low of 57% for UAE. It falls further for small-cap companies, with a high coverage of 28% seen for Saudi Arabian small-caps and a low of 3% for Kuwaiti small-caps.

<img title="Table2.png" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Reasons-for-poor-Analyst-Coverage-in-Kuwait-fig2.jpg" alt="Table2.png" width="676" height="316" />

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

In terms of cap-wise coverage as a percentage of total analyst coverage, Kuwait has a higher coverage among mid-cap companies, followed by small-cap. But the very low total coverage indicates that these numbers are much lower compared to other GCC nations. With the exception of Qatar, Kuwait has the lowest coverage in the small-cap segment among the four GCC nations.

Under GCC stocks that are followed by 5 or more analysts, Kuwait has the lowest coverage at 33.3% (only 5 companies) of stocks with analyst coverage, while the rest of the countries under consideration have more than 40% of stocks with analyst coverage that are covered by 5 or more analysts. Again, since the markets in the region are top heavy, most of the stocks with 5 or more analysts fall under the large cap, with lesser such coverage for the mid-cap and close to nil coverage for the small-cap stocks.

BUY and HOLD recommendations dominate the GCC markets, with close to or over 90% recommendations for Kuwait, Saudi and the UAE, while for Qatar it is 76%. SELL recommendations are the least popular in the region, with Qatar faring marginally better compared to its peers.

</div>
<img style="width: 605px; height: 129px;" title="Table3.png" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Reasons-for-poor-Analyst-Coverage-in-Kuwait-fig3.jpg" alt="Table3.png" />
<div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The reasons</strong>
<em>Markets driven by retail investors</em></div>
<div>

Over 45% of the value traded in Kuwait, across the years, is attributed to retail investors. Companies and funds, which are the major consumers of research, together accounted for around 30%, on average, since 2009.

<img style="width: 592px; height: 331px;" title="Fig1.png" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Reasons-for-poor-Analyst-Coverage-in-Kuwait-fig4.jpg" alt="Fig1.png" />

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

This figure is over 85% for Saudi Arabia, 73% for Dubai and 47% for Qatar. Primary reason why analyst coverage is low in the region is the relative lower consumption of research in the region

<em>Most research material widely available in English and not Arabic</em>
The presence of larger expat population compared to local population in the region and investments from companies and foreign institutions have pushed demand for research in English, while research in Arabic still lags behind. The demand for research in Arabic is less, which has led to lesser consumption of research among local investors, which has in turn led analysts to shift their focus to research primarily in English.

<em>Investments based on sentiments and speculation</em>
GCC markets are top-heavy, and investments are restricted mostly in the large- and mid-cap space. These investments are driven primarily by sentiments and speculation. Trading volumes are driven mostly by word-of-mouth information.

<em>Lack of Liquidity in the mid-cap and small-cap space</em>
Lack of liquidity, especially in the mid-cap and small-cap space, and general lack of investor interest has led to lower research offerings in this segment. The draining liquidity and the top heavy nature of the Kuwait bourse has led to dwindling analyst interest in the mid-cap and small-cap segment. Lack of new listings in the domestic market and landmark events in other regional indices has also contributed to lower liquidity in Kuwaiti bourse. Stock turnover ratio has been on a declining trend and stood at 22% in Kuwait Stock Exchange as against GCC average of 76%.

<div style="text-align: justify;"><em>Shell or Investment Companies </em>
A lot of the companies in the Kuwait stock exchange, especially in the small-cap segment, are shell companies or investment companies that trade on many of the asset classes, such as equities and real estate. Many of these experienced severe losses in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, and have not recovered since. Before the crisis, credit towards purchasing of securities, to the real estate sector and investment companies amounted to almost 50% of the total credit disbursed. The fall in equity value was exacerbated by leveraged positions of the market participants and consequently, credit disbursal fell to low single digits contributing further to lower liquidity in the bourse, which led to these companies halting their trading operations.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

<em>Information disclosure and Time taken</em>
Kuwait companies lag in timely disclosures compared to their regional peers, and the time taken for compliance is a lot more lenient. This can be seen in regular filings of financial results, where Kuwait lags behind the rest of the GCC. Delays in acquiring time-sensitive information and minimal public disclosures discourage analysts from following companies.

<img style="width: 578px; height: 193px;" title="Table4.png" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Reasons-for-poor-Analyst-Coverage-in-Kuwait-fig6.jpg" alt="Table4.png" />

<img style="width: 585px; height: 192px;" title="Table5.png" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Reasons-for-poor-Analyst-Coverage-in-Kuwait-fig7.jpg" alt="Table5.png" />

From the above two tables it can be seen that while the number of companies that have declared results seem much lower, in terms of market cap it is relatively higher. The reason for this is the declaration of financial results happens faster large-cap companies, as compared to mid- and small-cap companies. In the case of Kuwait, while only 16% of companies had declared Q4 results on 22 Feb 2015, this represented a market cap visibility of 54%, which implies that large-cap companies are quick to comply with exchange regulations compared to other companies. Also, compared to the GCC countries, Kuwait seems to have relatively lenient regulations as can be seen with the lowest company visibility.

Following the outbreak of financial crisis, regulators have increased required disclosures and filing requirements. But the cost of compliance, which includes auditing and disclosure costs has increased. In certain cases, the various costs associated with listing such as continued expenditures related to filing financials and ad hoc material information disclosures may no longer be a viable proposition, especially for smaller and undervalued companies.

The issuance of new regulations by the Capital Market Authority (CMA) of Kuwait in 2013 to improve investor confidence, gave the CMA greater independence to stop market irregularities, and boost transparency in bourse dealings. This gave the regulatory authority teeth to go after companies that are non-compliant with issued regulations and exchange rules, as seen with a number of companies that have been delisted recently – voluntarily or involuntarily – due to long inactivity, suspension of trading or failure to publish financial results within the stipulated time. Poor operational performances of firms resulting in losses that cumulatively exceed 75% of their capital are also delisted. But the strict enforcement of corporate governance and exchange rules still lags behind the rest of the GCC peers.

<strong>What should be done to increase analyst coverage?</strong>
Kuwait is behind the curve compared to other GCC countries in improving capital market efficiencies. Despite being the oldest stock exchange with the maximum number of listed stocks, the market lacks the required breadth and depth due to the concentration of stocks to a limited number of sectors. Increasing the depth would encourage research activities. Steps should be taken for Kuwait to represent the MSCI EM Index similar to UAE and Qatar. The first step to achieve that would be encouraging foreign investors to invest in the market. The fact that the market is dominated by retail participant’s disincentives the needs for research. Steps should be taken to encourage domestic institutional investors who have a longer term investment horizon to invest in the stock market which would also bring in the much need liquidity.

The Capital Market Authority should look at enforcing corporate governance codes to improve quality of disclosures. It should also encourage companies to engage with the analysts on a regular basis to ensure maximum information sharing. The CMA should also ensure that there is timely availability of information and data on listed companies either on through a separate website or through the existing system. Cross-listing stocks on other regional exchanges where there is more analysts coverage could aid in spurring research in Kuwait.

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]The main goal of an investor or a money manager is to create wealth - be it through capital appreciation strategy, dividend strategy or a capital preservation strategy. Unfortunately over the last 10 year period (2005-October 2015) all but Muscat stock exchange failed to create wealth for investors . That said, looking at the 5 year data, UAE and Qatar posted remarkable returns compared to its peers. Dubai and Abu Dhabi posted 16% and 11% five year CAGR respectively while Qatar posted 9% during the same period the main catalyst for Qatar and the UAE was the inclusion of their respective markets in MSCI EM Index. Assuming investors picked a passive strategy, they would have failed to create wealth over the 10 year period (except Oman) and the 5 year period (barring UAE and Qatar).

While at a macro level markets did not create value, at a stock level we have many winners and losers. After dissecting the stock universe based on size (large, mid and small), we applied liquidity filter (to weed out illiquid companies) to see how they stack up. Here are the results of GCC value creators.

<strong>Large Cap GCC companies</strong>

We identified 30 large cap companies for our 10 year analysis and 40 companies for our 5 year analysis dominated mostly by banks followed by Telecom. Over the past 10 years, large caps yielded a CAGR of -4% (the range was between +14% and -10%). The range was more pronounced in the 5 year period, during which GCC large caps posted returns ranging between +34% to -23%. However on an average, GCC large cap companies posted +7% (5 year CAGR).

<em>Source: Reuters and Marmore, the chart shows the dominance of each sector, measured by the total number of companies in our study</em>

<strong>Mid Cap GCC companies </strong>

Most money managers will focus on large and medium cap companies within their asset allocation strategy since small cap companies are considered risky. Had they invested in mid cap companies, would money managers have outperformed top heavy allocations? In short, yes, since mid cap companies performed better than large caps on both 10 and 5 year periods. Over the 10 year period the CAGR was -2% (50% less than large caps) while 5 year average CAGR was slightly better than large caps at 8% In this study we identified 144 companies that fit our criteria for the 5 year period and 98 companies that fit our 10 year period criteria.

<strong>Small Cap Companies</strong>

In our study of small cap companies, 418 companies matched our 5 year criteria and 287 companies matched our 10 year criteria. On average small caps destroyed wealth, be it during the medium term investment period of 5 years or a long term period of 10 years. GCC small cap destroyed wealth on average by -1% CAGR during the 5 year period and -6% during the 10 year period.

The ranges of returns were the highest among the 3 classifications (large, mid and small cap). In the 5 year CAGR timeline, GCC small caps posted a high of 41% and a low of -39%. When pulling the data further to 10 years, the range of return was quite similar +44% to -36%.

<strong>Final Words</strong>

All in all, GCC market performance over the past decade was negative. Over the past 5 years, only large and medium cap companies created value (based on our liquidity criteria). Moreover, banks clearly dominated the pool of sectors. That said investors should evaluate their investment strategy annually and make appropriate changes to avoid capital loss. Our experiment shows that simply being a long term dormant investor does not work as everything changes with time and so should our investment strategy and outlook. Passive investors who invested in 2005 have no edge over people who invested in 2010 or few years ago.[:ar]The main goal of an investor or a money manager is to create wealth - be it through capital appreciation strategy, dividend strategy or a capital preservation strategy.

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]According to Marmore’s recently released Monthly Market Review, MENA markets ended mostly in red during the month of October 2015. Abu Dhabi (-4.0%) suffered the most, followed by Saudi Arabia (-3.8%), Dubai (-2.5%) and Bahrain (-2.0%). Despite the increase in oil prices during October, the lower-than-expected oil prices continue to strain the MENA markets. The regional markets are also responding to instability in the global economy and anticipated monetary tightening in response to low oil prices.  KSA is contemplating spending cuts and tax increases to manage its fiscal deficit. Saudi Arabia's weakness is dampening sentiments of the region, even in countries such as the United Arab Emirates & Kuwait, which are relatively well placed to cope with an era of cheap oil. Egypt (3.1%), Oman (2.4%) and Qatar (1.2%) markets gained in October. Kuwait’s price index ended the month of October with a marginal gain of 0.9%. On the contrary the Kuwait weighted index remained stagnant.

<strong>MENA Market Trends – October 2015</strong>
<a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Fiscal-Measures-Worry-Markets-fig1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img style="width: 620px; height: 300px;" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Fiscal-Measures-Worry-Markets-fig1.jpg" alt="MENA Market Trends – October 2015" /></a>

Global equities ended the October month with strong gains after a sharp fall in August and September, which was fueled by fears over the global slowdown, with China as the epicenter. Oil prices rose after the U.S. oil rig count fell for a ninth straight week, indicating potentially lower crude output in coming months in the face of a global supply glut. Subdued worries about slowing Chinese growth, proactive approach of rate cuts by People’s Bank of China to stimulate the economy and investor’s positive response to U.S. Federal Reserve continued lower interest rates low and the European Central Bank further easing are some of the key reasons that fueled the rally of the Global equity markets in October.

MENA markets liquidity gained some momentum in October, with volume increasing by 12% and value traded by 14.2%, post the lulled market activity due to Eid and investor sentiments. However, Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Bahrain are a few exceptions where the trading activity declined. Amongst the MENA markets, Morocco showed the most improvement with value traded increasing by 33.3% and volume traded increasing by 58%. With the value traded declining by 79% and volume by 68%, Bahrain’s market liquidity was worst hit.

Emirates Telecom (UAE) has benefited from its decision to allow foreign and institutional investors to own its shares from Mid-September and has rallied since then. Despite the drop of 9% in Q3 profits, it managed to be the top gainer (7%) in October, followed by SABIC (KSA) and NCB (KSA) which gained 4.8% and 4.5% respectively. First Gulf Bank (-11.5%), National Bank of Abu Dhabi (-8.6%) and Al Rajhi Bank (-5.9%) were the top three losers in October. With the top three losers being banks, it is evident that banks in the region are grappling with margin pressures and liquidity issues as the oil producing states face a squeeze on budgets from lower oil prices.

Saudi Arabian Government is actively pursuing several initiatives to keep its fiscal budget deficit in check. Saudi Arabia is considering raising domestic energy prices; the existing system of subsidies in the kingdom is blamed for waste and surging fuel consumption. Saudi Arabia's government was in talks with local banks to sell them 20 billion riyals (USD 5.3 billion) of local currency bonds.

Iran will officially notify producer group Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in December of its plans to raise its crude oil output by 500,000 barrels per day (bpd). Kuwait said there were no calls within OPEC to change the oil group's production policy and that lower output from high-cost producers could support prices in 2016, adding to signs OPEC will keep its strategy of defending market share. Meanwhile, OPEC forecast in a monthly report that demand for its oil in 2016 would be much higher than previously thought as lower prices curb U.S. shale oil and other rival supply sources, reducing a global surplus.

		<Title>[:en]Islamic Finance: Areas for Innovation[:ar]التمويل الإسلامي: مجالات للابتكار[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<strong>Islamic finance industry</strong> has evolved and grown considerably since its inception in a rudimentary form during 1960s. The focus of the Islamic finance industry during its initial stage of inception was to create customer awareness and product development. However, the increased recognition and awareness, along with high demand resulted in rapid growth in the value and transformation of the industry over the next few decades.<br />
<br />
The global Islamic finance industry realised $2.1tn of assets in 2014 and is gearing up to more sustainable growth trajectory. At this stage it is imperative for the industry to focus on product innovation, which is considered to be one of the key growth drivers for the industry in the forthcoming years. The increased understanding and appetite for Shariah compliant products across the segments which includes Islamic banking, Takaful, Sukuk and funds calls for more innovative products and services to meet the growing demand.<br />
<br />
<strong>Islamic Banking:</strong><br />
<br />
The continuing expansion of Islamic banking sector in key markets such as Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, UAE, Kuwait and Qatar has resulted in strong competition. Moreover, the Islamic banks face the challenge of lower profitability compared to their conventional peers. The estimated profitability of Islamic banks is 19% lower than the conventional banks, attributable to higher expenses . Islamic banks have a much lower per customer Average Product Holding (APH) of 2.1 compared to the conventional banks with an APH of 4.9. Development of newer products in the Islamic banking segment can lead to a wider basket of products providing cross-selling opportunities, resulting in higher APH and potential higher profitability.<br />
<br />
Another challenge faced by the Islamic banking segment is they lack economies of scale and operating basic technologies. However, through technology and innovation the Islamic banks can bring down the cost of serving customers. Since the customers are also in favour of availing themselves financial services through mobile and internet banking channels, it becomes vital for Islamic banks to offer technological innovative services.<br />
<br />
<strong>Sukuk:</strong><br />
<br />
In recent years, Sukuk products have seen significant innovation with the introduction of hybrid, convertible, perpetual, retail and insurance-linked issuances. The implementation of Basel III has led to Islamic firms&rsquo; issuing innovative Basel III‒compliant sukuk instruments to meet revised capital standards. Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank was the first to launch this type of issue in late 2012, and others have followed, including Dubai Islamic Bank&rsquo;s perpetual $1 billion Tier 1 sukuk in March 2013 and Al Hilal bank in July 2014. Though there wasn&rsquo;t a structural innovation, these issues used the Mudarabah structures as opposed to Murabaha or Ijarah structures predominantly used in Malaysian issuance.<br />
<br />
The use of hybrid structures which involves more than one Islamic contract and issuances involving intangible assets such as airtime vouchers, broadband units and intellectual property are some of the recent innovative accomplishments of the sukuk industry. The industry continues to face hurdles as most of the existing structures are unable to support large size issuances in case of absence of viable asset base. The future of the Sukuk market is heavily reliant on innovation, where new assets, structures and markets continue to create new opportunities for investors and also serve to widen both the base of issuers, and the frequency with which issuers can access the Sukuk market.<br />
<br />
<strong>Funds:</strong><br />
<br />
The Islamic asset management industry is forecasted to grow to at least USD 77bn in 2019 . However, the industry is unlikely in the near- to mid-term to bridge the USD 108bn supply-latent demand gap. One of the biggest challenges faced by the Islamic finance asset managers is the lack of product diversification.<br />
<br />
As the GCC region HNIs and families seek to protect wealth from the rout of the market swings, succession planning is deemed to become of high significance in the coming years. Diversification into broad range of assets classes is the obvious strategy to adopt, however, the requisite of Shariah compliant family offices to invest in Shariah compliant instruments makes the task of the wealth and asset management advisors extremely formidable. This challenge can be overcome by providing innovative investment solutions to these family offices that include greater access to conventional funds feeder fund structures and Shariah compliant structured investment products.<br />
<br />
Another, prospective opportunity for the wealth managers is to align themselves with conventional &ldquo;Socially Responsible&rdquo; funds, since Socially Responsible funds like Islamic funds avoid investments in alcohol, gambling, arms manufacture, tobacco and also avoid high leverage and investments in highly speculative derivative products. A synergy between Islamic wealth managers and Socially Responsible funds can result in rapid growth in Shariah compliant investment products.<br />
<br />
Apart from the Socially Responsible funds, the asset management industry can look for development of innovative structures to access assets held within institutions such as waqf and takaful. Private equity is another interesting area, as the shared risk-and-reward characteristics of the asset class are a particularly appropriate structure for Islamic investors.<br />
<br />
<strong>Takaful:</strong><br />
<br />
Despite double digit growth rates in the recent years, the global gross takaful contributions amounted at an estimated USD 21.4bn as of 1H 2014 , contributing 1% to the global Islamic finance assets. Some of the key challenges faced by the industry are low penetration of insurance in key markets such GCC and Malaysia and limit product portfolio consisting of mainly &ldquo;plain vanilla&rdquo; products related to family, medical and motor takaful. By embracing innovation the takaful industry can look to improve its distribution and service capabilities to reach out to wider audience. Moreover, takaful operators can expand their product portfolio beyond traditional coverage to include segments as diverse as wealth management, educational planning schemes and retirement plans. Through innovation, the takaful operators can also achieve to offer complex products that include a savings or investment component.<br />
<br />
<strong>Waqf:</strong><br />
<br />
Waqf, which refers to a religious endowment - a perpetual dedication of one&rsquo;s wealth or a portion of it in cash or kind, and devoting its benefit or usufruct to religious and charitable causes. The global waqf assets are estimated in excess of USD 1 trillion but mostly are under-developed or poorly managed. The scale of assets size can be sustainable source of funding and can make significant contributions to the economy. The assets offer potential opportunities for Islamic finance industry and investors, however, the industry needs to devise innovative instruments and products to benefit from these assets and at the same time contribute to the growth of these assets.<br />
<br />
<strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
<br />
Conducive regulatory framework comprising of comprehensive legislation, dedicated shariah commercial court, financial mediation bureau and arbitration centre for dispute resolution, tax neutrality policies, Shariah advisory council and Shariah governance framework are some of the essential aspects to stimulate product development and innovation across the Islamic finance industry. One of the biggest hurdles in the path of product innovation faced by the industry is the Shariah oversight. It is vital for the new innovative products to get wider acceptance and attract lesser criticism in the lines of mimicking the conventional financial products. This can be achieved by ensuring the innovative products not just being Shariah compliant in form but being compliant in substance as well.[:ar]<strong>Islamic finance industry</strong> has evolved and grown considerably since its inception in a rudimentary form during 1960s. The focus of the Islamic finance industry during its initial stage of inception was to create customer awareness and product development. However, the increased recognition and awareness, along with high demand resulted in rapid growth in the value and transformation of the industry over the next few decades.<br />
<br />
The global Islamic finance industry realised $2.1tn of assets in 2014 and is gearing up to more sustainable growth trajectory. At this stage it is imperative for the industry to focus on product innovation, which is considered to be one of the key growth drivers for the industry in the forthcoming years. The increased understanding and appetite for Shariah compliant products across the segments which includes Islamic banking, Takaful, Sukuk and funds calls for more innovative products and services to meet the growing demand.<br />
<br />
<strong>Islamic Banking:</strong><br />
<br />
The continuing expansion of Islamic banking sector in key markets such as Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, UAE, Kuwait and Qatar has resulted in strong competition. Moreover, the Islamic banks face the challenge of lower profitability compared to their conventional peers. The estimated profitability of Islamic banks is 19% lower than the conventional banks, attributable to higher expenses . Islamic banks have a much lower per customer Average Product Holding (APH) of 2.1 compared to the conventional banks with an APH of 4.9. Development of newer products in the Islamic banking segment can lead to a wider basket of products providing cross-selling opportunities, resulting in higher APH and potential higher profitability.<br />
<br />
Another challenge faced by the Islamic banking segment is they lack economies of scale and operating basic technologies. However, through technology and innovation the Islamic banks can bring down the cost of serving customers. Since the customers are also in favour of availing themselves financial services through mobile and internet banking channels, it becomes vital for Islamic banks to offer technological innovative services.<br />
<br />
<strong>Sukuk:</strong><br />
<br />
In recent years, Sukuk products have seen significant innovation with the introduction of hybrid, convertible, perpetual, retail and insurance-linked issuances. The implementation of Basel III has led to Islamic firms&rsquo; issuing innovative Basel III‒compliant sukuk instruments to meet revised capital standards. Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank was the first to launch this type of issue in late 2012, and others have followed, including Dubai Islamic Bank&rsquo;s perpetual $1 billion Tier 1 sukuk in March 2013 and Al Hilal bank in July 2014. Though there wasn&rsquo;t a structural innovation, these issues used the Mudarabah structures as opposed to Murabaha or Ijarah structures predominantly used in Malaysian issuance.<br />
<br />
The use of hybrid structures which involves more than one Islamic contract and issuances involving intangible assets such as airtime vouchers, broadband units and intellectual property are some of the recent innovative accomplishments of the sukuk industry. The industry continues to face hurdles as most of the existing structures are unable to support large size issuances in case of absence of viable asset base. The future of the Sukuk market is heavily reliant on innovation, where new assets, structures and markets continue to create new opportunities for investors and also serve to widen both the base of issuers, and the frequency with which issuers can access the Sukuk market.<br />
<br />
<strong>Funds:</strong><br />
<br />
The Islamic asset management industry is forecasted to grow to at least USD 77bn in 2019 . However, the industry is unlikely in the near- to mid-term to bridge the USD 108bn supply-latent demand gap. One of the biggest challenges faced by the Islamic finance asset managers is the lack of product diversification.<br />
<br />
As the GCC region HNIs and families seek to protect wealth from the rout of the market swings, succession planning is deemed to become of high significance in the coming years. Diversification into broad range of assets classes is the obvious strategy to adopt, however, the requisite of Shariah compliant family offices to invest in Shariah compliant instruments makes the task of the wealth and asset management advisors extremely formidable.

Private equity is another interesting area, as the shared risk-and-reward characteristics of the asset class are a particularly appropriate structure for Islamic investors.<br />
<br />
<strong>Takaful:</strong><br />
<br />
Despite double digit growth rates in the recent years, the global gross takaful contributions amounted at an estimated USD 21.4bn as of 1H 2014 , contributing 1% to the global Islamic finance assets. Some of the key challenges faced by the industry are low penetration of insurance in key markets such GCC and Malaysia and limit product portfolio consisting of mainly &ldquo;plain vanilla&rdquo; products related to family, medical and motor takaful.

<strong>GCC M&A Deals Country-Wise Scenario</strong><br />
<strong>Kuwait - </strong>During Q2 2015, Kuwait witnessed 4 M&A deals completed with 100% of the deals being domestic acquisitions. The acquisition of Al Mulla International Financing and Investment Company &ndash; Auto Finance Portfolio by Warba Bank for USD 66mn with a profit sharing arrangement was largest in terms of reported deals values closed during Q2 of 2015. Kuwait based Al Ahli Bank&rsquo;s acquisition of 98.5 percent stake in Piraeus Bank&#39;s Egyptian unit for USD 150 million is a large value cross-border deal in pipeline for Kuwait. However, there aren&rsquo;t any transactions in pipeline targeting companies based in Kuwait.<br />
<br />
<strong>KSA - </strong>The closed transactions involved targets in Spain and Kuwait. Two of the announced transactions involved targets in Saudi Arabia while the third involved a target in Egypt. The 11% acquisition of International Acetyl Company and International Vinyl Acetate Company by Saudi International petrochemical Company for USD 100mn is the largest announced deal in terms of value.<br />
<br />
<strong>UAE -</strong> UAE was home to some of the large value and the most geographically diversified M&A deals completed during Q2 2015. The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority&rsquo;s 100% acquisition of China based Grand Hyatt Hong Kong Company and New World Harbourview Hotel Company for USD 975mn and US based Renaissance Raleigh North Hills Hotel for USD 80mn were two of the largest deals closed during Q2 2015. Apart, from the domestic acquisition of Dragon Oil by Emirates National Oil Company, UAE had an outbound acquisition of Canada based Fairview Container Terminal by DP World for USD 461mn in the pipeline. Almost 48% of closed deals involved targets outside the GCC, 48% were in the UAE, and 4% in GCC countries other than the UAE, showing the preference of investing outside the GCC region and at home.<br />
<br />
<strong>Qatar - </strong>Qatar didn&rsquo;t witness any inbound acquisitions during Q2 2015. Almost 72% of the closed deals were outbound acquisitions with China, Italy and United Kingdom as target countries. The 20% stake acquisition of China based HK Electric Investments for USD 1,194mn by Qatar Holding was the largest in terms of deals value amongst the closed transactions. The domestic M&A deals involving acquisition of 49% stake in International Acetyl Company and International Vinyl Acetate Company by Qatar Quality Foods for USD 1mn is the deal in pipeline for Qatar.<br />
<br />
<strong>Bahrain -&nbsp; </strong>All of the transactions by Bahraini acquirers were closed and there are no transactions in pipeline. 1 of the closed transactions involved targets in Bahrain and the other 1 took place in GCC markets other than Bahrain. Bahraini acquirers did not engage in any transactions involving targets outside the GCC region. The outbound 100% acquisition of Saudi based Events Mall by Gulf Finance House for USD 48mn was the largest deal value closed during Q2 2015.<br />
<br />
<strong>Oman -&nbsp;</strong>Oman is the only country amongst its GCC peers which had 100% outbound acquisitions during Q2 2015. On the contrary the two deals in the pipeline are domestic M&A deals. The 40% acquisition of Italy based Sigit S.p.A. for an undisclosed amount by Oman Investment Fund was the deal closed during Q2 2015.<br />

Overall, M&A activity in the GCC region during Q2 2015 improved compared to Q1 2015. However, it declined marginally compared to Q2 2014. The majority of the transactions completed were either outbound targeting companies in Non-GCC countries or domestic deals. The inbound M&A activity within the GCC region involved the two transactions discussed in table above. The 4 inbound deals closed during Q2 2015 involving Non-GCC acquirers were targeting companies based in the UAE. The UAE and Saudi Arabia are expected to continue to be the key players in the M&A in the region and are among world&rsquo;s top 10 countries forecasted to experience the fastest M&A and IPO growth until 2020. The M&A activity in the UAE is expected to rise from USD 2.2bn in 2014 to USD 6.8bn in 2015. The forecast also shows that deal activity will stabilize from 2016 to 2020, albeit with a peak of around USD 5.7bn in 2018 . The M&A activity in Saudi Arabia is expected to raise from USD 747mn in 2014 to USD 2.9bn in 2015.[:]]]></Content>

		<Title>[:en]GCC WACC - A Toolkit for Corporate Financiers[:ar]متوسط التكلفة المرجح لرأس المال لدول مجلس التعاون الخليجي - مجموعة أدوات لممولي الشركات[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) assumes importance in corporate finance decision making. In the GCC, unlisted companies outnumber listed companies by miles and hence most of the deals involve unlisted companies in one way or other. Corporate finance professionals face twin problem while valuing an unlisted company. They have to estimate future cash flows and also estimate the appropriate &ldquo;discount rate&rdquo; at which these cash flows can be discounted to the present. Such a discount rate is nothing but the cost of capital adjusted for the weights of capital in the capital structure.<br />
<br />
The broad methodology of our computation can be illustrated as:<br />
<img alt="Weighted Average Cost of Capital - WACC" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GCC-WACC-fig1.jpg" /><br />
<br />
Source: Markaz Research; Note: &lsquo;D&rsquo; stands for Debt and &lsquo;E&rsquo; stands for Equity.<br />
<br />
In our report (GCC WACC &ndash; A Toolkit for Corporate Financiers), we have computed the WACC for GCC countries.<br />
<br />
<strong>Why does WACC vary widely?</strong><br />
Cost of equity is subjective as different people use different methods to compute beta. Some use monthly data for past 5 years while others prefer weekly data for past 3 years. As beta is derived based on historical price data, few adjust it under the assumption that the beta value would revert towards the mean value of 1 over the long period. Difference in equity cost would lead to a range of values for cost of capital.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Risk-free rate and equity risk premium values are dynamic in nature and change with time depending on the market perception of risk. Read more<br />
<br />
<strong>WACC Methodology</strong><br />
&#39;Opportunity cost&#39; also referred to as &lsquo;hurdle cost&rsquo; or &lsquo;discount rate&rsquo; is of primary importance in valuation and helps the management in identifying projects which add value to the enterprise. Given the importance of this metric in creating value for shareholders, it&rsquo; is essential to understand how it is computed. Though, in reality, it&rsquo;s surprising to note that not much effort is diverted towards the calculation of cost of capital; while a significant amount of time is focussed on forecasting uncertain future cash flows. Improper capital cost assumptions could lead to type-I error (accepting projects that don&rsquo;t add shareholder value) or type-II error (rejecting projects that add shareholder value).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In order to compute the cost of capital, we start by finding the cost of each capital component that the firm utilizes. Cost of capital primarily consists of equity and debt costs, weighed according to the proportions of debt and equity capital in the capital structure. The cost of debt can be inferred easily as it entails specific cost in the form of interest payments made in cash. The entire debt mix including money market debt in the form of commercial papers/notes, bank debt in the form of loans/overdraft, financial leases and bonds raised is aggregated. The interest payments made as a proportion of interest bearing debt instruments provides us with the debt cost.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Unlike debt holders, equity holders do not demand an explicit return on their capital. However, equity holders incur an implicit opportunity cost for investing in a specific company, because they could invest in an alternative company with similar risk profile. Equity cost involves various factors such as risk free asset, beta, market risk premium, country risk premium among others.&nbsp;Beta - a measure of priced risk, which is arrived by regressing the past price returns on an index. As private firms do not trade, estimation of beta becomes problematic for private firms.<br />

		<Title>[:en]MENA Markets: What Happened in July?[:ar]أسواق الشرق الأوسط وشمال أفريقيا: ماذا حدث في يوليو؟[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]The blazing summer heat encouraged the yearly migration of GCC tourists to cooler locations. These past few years this “summer hibernation” has coincided with the holy month of Ramadan, which acts as a double whammy for stock markets in the region. And if that wasn’t enough, the lifting of Iran sanctions sent oil prices tumbling down, with IPE Brent falling 17.9% to USD 52 in July, and the sell-off in the Chinese markets had a pronounced impact in the region. The Chinese economy is tottering at the edges, as the domestic demand is yet to be stoked to levels that would allow for the domestic consumption driven structural change.

The recent decision by US and the Eurozone countries to lift the economic sanctions imposed on Iran few years ago has opened an interesting dynamic in the oil market. According to the Iran oil ministry, the lifting of sanctions would result in Iran adding 500,000 barrels a day within a week after sanctions end and by 1 million barrels a day within a month to the global production. With the OPEC members not cutting down on their output, and indeed shoring and expanding facilities to increase production, like in Saudi and Kuwait, it remains to be seen how deep would the oil price fall in the coming months as the supply glut intensifies.

Overall, MENA market performance lacked positive triggers. Qatar had the worst performance shedding 3.4%, while Abu Dhabi, the leader of the pack, posted a 2.3% gain. The Abu Dhabi index was one of the rare bright sparks in the region for the month of July, as positive earnings results among banking stocks buoyed market performance.

Post-Eid celebrations, trading activity picked up in the markets especially in the small cap segment. But across the spectrum, MENA markets saw dwindling value and volume traded in July (29% and -33%, respectively).

Compared to 2014, value traded has to play catch up as the first 7 month of 2015 has yielded only 44% of the value from last year. That said, the star performance so far has been Dubai, with a 9.8% YTD gain and room for further improvements, since it is trading below its GCC peers at 10.9x.

<strong>MENA markets in July 2015</strong>

MENA markets are a long way from their last peak prices, with the exception of Qatar which is inching closer to its decade high. Dubai stock market had a stellar performance over the past few years; in 2013 the market doubled, while in 2014 Dubai closed the year with 12% gain. Dubai still can scale and create a new high, given continued positive earnings and strong spending by the state.

<strong>Post-crash return</strong>
What happens to your money if you had invested in MENA indices during the crash? The following tables give you an idea of returns if one had invested a dollar in each of the markets in 2009. For example, if you invested a dollar in Dubai, you would receive $2.53, a 153% return. However, if you had invested the same amount in Jordan, today you will have netted $0.67 (i.e) a 33% loss. While some conclude that GCC markets are more resilient than MENA markets, they would be wrong as a dollar invested in Bahrain and Kuwait Price index would have seen a loss of 26% and 20%, respectively.

Overall, MENA markets lacked positive triggers in July, and the next month is also expected to be slow, as the business community and the government sector are still in the “summer hibernation mode”. One thing to watch out for is the impact of entry of Iran oil on an already saturated market, and China’s dwindling growth.

MENA markets are a long way from their last peak prices, with the exception of Qatar which is inching closer to its decade high. Dubai stock market had a stellar performance over the past few years; in 2013 the market doubled, while in 2014 Dubai closed the year with 12% gain. Dubai still can scale and create a new high, given continued positive earnings and strong spending by the state.

<strong>Post-crash return</strong>
What happens to your money if you had invested in MENA indices during the crash? The following tables give you an idea of returns if one had invested a dollar in each of the markets in 2009. For example, if you invested a dollar in Dubai, you would receive $2.53, a 153% return. However, if you had invested the same amount in Jordan, today you will have netted $0.67 (i.e) a 33% loss. While some conclude that GCC markets are more resilient than MENA markets, they would be wrong as a dollar invested in Bahrain and Kuwait Price index would have seen a loss of 26% and 20%, respectively.

Overall, MENA markets lacked positive triggers in July, and the next month is also expected to be slow, as the business community and the government sector are still in the “summer hibernation mode”. One thing to watch out for is the impact of entry of Iran oil on an already saturated market, and China’s dwindling growth.

In contrast, Riyadh, the capital city of Saudi Arabia, boasts of a population of 6 million and a GDP per capita based on PPP of USD 54,000.

Both <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong> and the <strong>UAE</strong> are oil rich countries. In order to reduce their dependency on oil revenue the two countries are diversifying into non-oil sectors. In fact, the UAE has a head start as it already has more than 50% of its GDP now come from non-oil revenue. Both countries have welcomed Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to help diversify and provide employment to its teeming millions.

Middle East financial centers have registered continuous growth in the Global Financial Center Index (GFCI) rankings. GFCI evaluates countries based on five main factors namely, business environment, financial development, infrastructure, human capital and reputational & general factors to assess their competitive standing as a financial center.

<strong>Dubai leads the way</strong>
Currently, other countries in the GCC region are trying to emulate the growth strategy of Dubai financial center. While Qatar Financial Center (QFC) is specialized in insurance and asset management segments, Bahrain is dominant in Fund Administration, Islamic Finance and Offshore banking. In fact, Abu Dhabi is also trying to establish itself as a financial hub, positioning itself to specialize in private banking, wealth management and asset management. Its non-restriction on foreign ownership in free trade zones provides Abu Dhabi an edge over GCC peers. Though the competition among the GCC countries is rising, it is not a zero sum game as every center has its own specialization that enhances the reputation of other centers, thus helping the GCC countries to grow as a whole.

The <a title="Dubai International Financial Centre" href="https://www.difc.ae/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dubai International Finance Center (DIFC)</a> was established in 2004 as a financial free zone regulated by DIFC Authority. DIFC has its own laws and court system to create an efficient environment to provide a specialized platform for investments and private banking. It offers various incentives to attract investors. It allows 100% foreign ownership and the profits are tax-free. It does not restrict foreign exchange and its infrastructure adds to its positives.

Nasdaq Dubai exchange situated in DIFC has issued USD 13 billion in Sukuk (Islamic Bonds) in the year 2014 to create market for Islamic bonds by assembling leading investment banks. DIFC has observed 18% growth in number of companies; increasing the number of business located in DIFC to 1,225 comprising of 362 financial services firms, 682 non-financial services firms and 171 retailers.

<strong>Riyadh has some distance to go…</strong>
The government in Saudi Arabia has created industrial sites to attract FDIs. It has also built the King Abdullah Economic City to spread its wings globally and become the financial hub in MENA region. But to become an international financial hub, Riyadh must first focus on becoming a regional hub.

Riyadh, which is the headquarters of the GCC Monetary Council and could host the GCC central bank, is a step in the right direction. It is set to open its USD 540 billion equity market to international investments. Few positives that will prove attractive to investors include its favorable demographics comprising growing young population, increasing expenditure by government of around USD 130 billion to boost the non-oil sector, availability of energy at low prices and scope for further growth and development.

The <a title="Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul)" href="http://www.tadawul.com.sa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tadawul Stock Index</a> is one of the top ten performing indexes in terms of USD compared to other more than 90 stock exchanges tracked by Bloomberg globally. It has the largest market capitalization in the region of USD 540 billion, which is same size as market of other GCC countries combined.

But there are various restrictions imposed by the Saudi government that limits Riyadh from becoming a financial center of choice. Saudi Arabia’s implementation of Qualified Foreign Investment (QFI) scheme limits the access by foreign investors to its domestic market. Holding of shares of all issuers by QFIs and QFI approved clients in aggregate has been limited to 10% of market value and 20% is the maximum that QFIs can hold in an individual stock.

Lifestyle is an important factor for growth. Although the winds of change are blowing Saudi Arabia is still not western as compared to Dubai, which acts as an important factor for the foreign investors. The national policy of Saudization, where foreign workers are replaced by Saudi national’s acts as another limitation from attracting businesses.[:ar]Dubai is a global business city located in the UAE with a population of 2.1 million and a GDP per capita based on PPP of USD 65,000.

<br />
Among GCC countries, Saudi Arabia has the best reporting regulations.&nbsp; Its Code of Corporate Governance is a case in point. A Standard & Poor report suggests that of all the GCC firms covered by it only 6.3 per cent have strong scores for management and governance. Yes, companies are rather secretive about their financials.<br />
<br />
They also do not share forward guidance with analysts. Little wonder, stock prices do not reflect corporate fundamentals. This information irregularity accentuates the risk for investors. Add to this the absence of a derivatives market, as also the absence of a market for short selling, and the result is scatter pricing.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The Morgan Stanley Capital international (MSCI) classified the GCC markets as frontier markets because of these institutional issues as also the restrictions on foreign investors. UAE and Qatar that recently got upgraded to the Emerging market status, effective May 2014 are the exceptions. This change can attract more institutional investors.&nbsp; In their bid to be classified as &ldquo;Emerging&rdquo; market, Saudi Capital Markets Authority are trying make markets more efficient, and to allow foreign investment. From June 2015, in a move that will help to boost inflows, improve corporate governance and reduce volatility, Qualified Foreign Investors (QFIs) will be able to buy and sell blue-chip stocks.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>What is the current status of equity research in the region?</strong><br />
The GCC fund managers have an advantage over their global peers in generating alpha returns. The inefficiencies of the markets make this possible. This is in sharp contrast to developed markets like the US where active strategies stopped producing higher returns, It&rsquo;s no surprise that Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), which are popular among the mutual funds in developed markets, haven&rsquo;t made a mark in the GCC.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
A few large cap stocks, mostly in Oil & Gas and Financial services sector, dominate the GCC Equity market. They have high liquidity and investors prefer them to small and mid-cap companies.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The trend of analyst recommendations on GCC stocks observed over the last 12 months show that over 90% were either &lsquo;Buy&rsquo; or &lsquo;Hold&#39;. As most of the research coverage was on large caps, the recommendations were favorable to them, a trend that continued even though the markets were not in line with these recommendations!<br />
<br />
The reason can be due to the larger target audience for the Buy reports (new investors) compared to the Sell reports (existing investors). It can also be due to the reluctance of the analysts to issue a &lsquo;Sell&rsquo; recommendation in order to get favorable deals for Investment Banking activities. The analysts might want to be in the good books of the company for extracting information from them in the future.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Equity analysts generally ignore small and mid-cap companies. The high illiquidity in these stocks discourages investors from choosing these securities. Investors might not realize capital gains by investing in them in spite of the fact that some of the SMEs have the potential to scale up and produce high earnings growth.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If the market never adjusts to the intrinsic value, will these stocks gain momentum?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Why is there a need for wider equity research? </strong><br />
The lack of wider research activity in the region is responsible for the information-inefficiency of the markets. The investors are happy with their large cap portfolio and the funds are happy outperforming the benchmark indices. If markets become more efficient and stock prices start to reflect the fundamental these funds will stop making money. There is clearly a case for more Equity research.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Due to the absence of active equity market, the small and mid-cap companies rely on bank loans to raise capital for their expansion plans. They are not able to take advantage of the enormous funds available in the region by issuing new equity.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Reforms in the capital markets can break this endless loop of illiquidity and lack of coverage. The Capital Market Authority (CMA) of Kuwait has issued new regulations and amendments since 2013 to improve investor confidence.<br />
<br />
The CMA is now empowered with greater independence to stop market irregularities, and boost transparency in bourse dealings. The financial system in the GCC is regulated and supervised by several regulators. A formal framework for coordination and information sharing across the&nbsp;regulatory&nbsp;agencies can help. Transparent disclosures and fair pricing of securities is possible by fixing the regulatory loopholes. The efficiency of capital markets will lead to optimal allocation of funds among various securities.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>What is the way forward?</strong><br />
The GCC countries need to work towards increasing market efficiency that would attract foreign capital. In recent times with the fall in oil price, the GCC states have diversified into non-oil sectors. Growth in these sectors will occur via IPO investments from the public sector, which would lead to demand for research. To attain emerging market status GCC states are enacting structural reforms. More exchanges are opening up their markets for foreign institutional investors. Industry and Economic reports are needed to help investors tap into the booming equity market.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Growth of equity research is an expected necessity as the markets become more transparent and efficient.[:ar]<strong>Introduction</strong><br />

&nbsp;<br />
A few large cap stocks, mostly in Oil &amp; Gas and Financial services sector, dominate the GCC Equity market. They have high liquidity and investors prefer them to small and mid-cap companies.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The trend of analyst recommendations on GCC stocks observed over the last 12 months show that over 90% were either &lsquo;Buy&rsquo; or &lsquo;Hold&#39;. As most of the research coverage was on large caps, the recommendations were favorable to them, a trend that continued even though the markets were not in line with these recommendations!<br />
<br />
The reason can be due to the larger target audience for the Buy reports (new investors) compared to the Sell reports (existing investors). It can also be due to the reluctance of the analysts to issue a &lsquo;Sell&rsquo; recommendation in order to get favorable deals for Investment Banking activities. The analysts might want to be in the good books of the company for extracting information from them in the future.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Equity analysts generally ignore small and mid-cap companies. The high illiquidity in these stocks discourages investors from choosing these securities. Investors might not realize capital gains by investing in them in spite of the fact that some of the SMEs have the potential to scale up and produce high earnings growth.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If the market never adjusts to the intrinsic value, will these stocks gain momentum?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Why is there a need for wider equity research? </strong><br />
The lack of wider research activity in the region is responsible for the information-inefficiency of the markets. The investors are happy with their large cap portfolio and the funds are happy outperforming the benchmark indices. If markets become more efficient and stock prices start to reflect the fundamental these funds will stop making money. There is clearly a case for more Equity research.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Due to the absence of active equity market, the small and mid-cap companies rely on bank loans to raise capital for their expansion plans. They are not able to take advantage of the enormous funds available in the region by issuing new equity.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Reforms in the capital markets can break this endless loop of illiquidity and lack of coverage. The Capital Market Authority (CMA) of Kuwait has issued new regulations and amendments since 2013 to improve investor confidence.<br />
<br />
The CMA is now empowered with greater independence to stop market irregularities, and boost transparency in bourse dealings. The financial system in the GCC is regulated and supervised by several regulators. A formal framework for coordination and information sharing across the&nbsp;regulatory&nbsp;agencies can help. Transparent disclosures and fair pricing of securities is possible by fixing the regulatory loopholes. The efficiency of capital markets will lead to optimal allocation of funds among various securities.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>What is the way forward?</strong><br />
The GCC countries need to work towards increasing market efficiency that would attract foreign capital. In recent times with the fall in oil price, the GCC states have diversified into non-oil sectors. Growth in these sectors will occur via IPO investments from the public sector, which would lead to demand for research. To attain emerging market status GCC states are enacting structural reforms. More exchanges are opening up their markets for foreign institutional investors. Industry and Economic reports are needed to help investors tap into the booming equity market.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Growth of equity research is an expected necessity as the markets become more transparent and efficient.[:]]]></Content>

		<Title>[:en]Why is Liquidity important? Some Research Snippets[:ar]ما هي أهمية السيولة؟ بعض مقتطفات البحث[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<span style="color: #000000;">Liquidity is at the backbone of any market development and GCC stock markets are no exception. Strong oil price backed wealth effect coupled with retail nature of the market triggering speculative activity contributed to very robust liquidity levels in the past, especially before the financial crisis. Liquidity is generally measured as total value traded and is expressed as a % of total market capitalization to arrive at the velocity. A high velocity may indicate that liquidity is running ahead of the market and vice versa. Also, improved liquidity has many benefits including cost of transaction. In the context of GCC stock markets, the following questions beg answers:</span>

- By how much did the liquidity drop for key index movers measured in terms of before and after Global Financial Crisis?
- What impact such a drop had on the bid-ask spread (a proxy to measure transaction cost)
- Are there any inconsistencies in this and if so what can explain it?

Before we answer these questions, let us quickly explain the methodology of this small research:

- We collected daily volume, value traded, market capitalization, bid-ask spread on 15 heavy weights in the GCC stock markets
- We organized this data in terms of pre financial crisis (before 2008) and post financial crisis (after 2008).
- We calculated Average Daily Value Traded (ADVT), a measure of liquidity for all the stocks
- We also calculated the Turnover ratio (defined as total volume traded/number of outstanding shares).

Now let us turn to our findings in a quest to answer our questions:
Table 1- % change between Pre-crisis (2003-2008) and Post crisis (2009-2013)
<img class="researchDemand" title="Why-is-Liquidity-important-image-1.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Why-is-Liquidity-important-fig1.jpg" alt="Why-is-Liquidity-important-image-1.jpg" />
<ul>
 	<li><span style="color: #000000;">By how much did the liquidity drop for key index movers measured in terms of before and after Global Financial Crisis?</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color: #000000;">Regarding the first question liquidity dropped across the board in the aftermath of the crisis as expected. For example SABIC’s daily average value traded (ADVT) stood at  USD 178 mn dollars during the period from 2003-2008. Post 2008 the ADVT fell by 27% to USD 130 mn dollars. Saudi Telecom saw a large decline in ADVT from USD 100 mn before the crisis to USD 11.9 mn a drop of almost 90%. The table above shows the effects of the crisis on the average value traded.</span>

<img class="researchDemand" title="Why-is-Liquidity-important-image-2.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Why-is-Liquidity-important-fig2.jpg" alt="Why-is-Liquidity-important-image-2.jpg" />
<ul>
 	<li><span style="color: #000000;">What impact such a drop had on the bid-ask spread (a proxy to measure transaction cost)</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color: #000000;"> In general, as liquidity improves, bid-ask spread reduces thereby reducing the cost of transaction. In the case of heavy weight GCC stocks, spreads increased in response to a fall in the liquidity for most of them. SABIC’s  Spread was 0.23% prior to the financial crisis while after the crisis it increased to 0.3%. In the case of Saudi Telecom the Spread increased marginally from 0.27% to 0.29%. The biggest increase in spreads is seen in Zain where before the crisis the spread was around 0.75% (high compared to Saudi companies) while after the crisis it increased by  88% to 1.42% though this cannot be totally attributed to a fall in ADVT as ADVT declined only by 9% compared to pre-crisis numbers</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="color: #000000;">Are there any inconsistencies in this and if so what can explain it?</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color: #000000;"> Finally were there any inconsistencies? Some companies in our study showed positive correlation in that while liquidity decreased, the bid-ask spread also decreased and vice versa. Examples include Emaar, First Gulf Bank and industries Qatar. However the main reason behind this positive correlation is that the mentioned companies did not have sufficient history for us to make meaningful comparison between pre-crisis and post crisis numbers. The only company with sufficient data was SAMBA and we could attribute the fall in liquidity to the financial crisis and attribute the fall in spread to peers. In other words, before the crisis SAMBA had the highest spread among Saudi banks under our coverage thus the number after the crisis had to drop to be in line with other Saudi banks.</span>

<strong>Concluding Thoughts:</strong>
Leading GCC stocks today have more bid-ask spread than a few years before thanks to poor liquidity. The bid-ask spread ranges from a low of 0.18% (Industries Qatar) to 1.52% (National Bank of Kuwait). Going forward, as liquidity improves, the bid-ask spread should reduce and may reach levels seen before the financial crisis. Market attractiveness to institutional investors can be significantly increased if liquidity improves and reduces the bid-ask spread.[:ar]<span style="color: #000000;">Liquidity is at the backbone of any market development and GCC stock markets are no exception.

		<Title>[:en]Never Scream Sell in GCC![:ar]الامتناع عن توصية البيع في دول مجلس التعاون الخليجي![:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<span style="color: #000000;">We have been regularly monitoring analysts’ recommendations in GCC and notice a weird trend. Most of the calls are either buy or hold. Look at the table below:
Table 1- Recommendations Vs the S&P GCC</span>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><img class="researchDemand" style="width: 605px; height: 344px;" title="Never-Scream-Sell-in-GCC-image-1-(1).jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Never-Scream-Sell-in-GCC-fig1.jpg" alt="Never-Scream-Sell-in-GCC" /></span></p>
<span style="color: #000000;">Since 2010, analysts scream either a buy or hold nearly 90% of the time. In the 2.5 years of study, only during 2H 2010 the market turned reasonably positive validating the scream. In all the other cases, the market movement was totally in contrast to the scream, especially during 2H 2011 when markets tanked 8.2% while 96% of recommendations were either buy or hold. This applies even at stock specific levels. We produce below some instances where analysts steadfastly screamed buy regardless of sharp drop in share price and sideway movement for a long time.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;"><img class="researchDemand" style="width: 605px; height: 419px;" title="Never-Scream-Sell-in-GCC-image-2.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Never-Scream-Sell-in-GCC-fig2.jpg" alt="Never-Scream-Sell-in-GCC-image" /></span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Etisalat is a classic example where analysts were screaming buy from Dhs 16 all the way to Dhs 6.5! Thereafter the stock moved sideways since the last 2 years and even then analysts still screamed buy all the way. Another good example would be<strong> First Gulf Bank</strong>.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;"><img class="researchDemand" style="width: 623px; height: 360px;" title="Never-Scream-Sell-in-GCC-image-3.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Never-Scream-Sell-in-GCC-fig3.jpg" alt="Never-Scream-Sell-in-GCC-image" /></span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Analysts screamed buy when the stock was quoting at Dhs 13 and they continue to yell buy till the stock tanked to Dhs 4! After this episode, we notice a string of buy recommendations and some hold recommendations while the stock moved sideways for the last 2 years.</span>

<span style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><img class="researchDemand" style="width: 606px; height: 359px;" title="Never-Scream-Sell-in-GCC-image-4.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Never-Scream-Sell-in-GCC-fig4.jpg" alt="Never-Scream-Sell-in-GCC-image-4.jpg" /></span>
</span>

<span style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">While we did not notice buy screams for Industries Qatar at the peak of the market in 2008, we noticed several hold and buy recommendations during the last few years when the stock performance was more or less flat.
So, the aggregate data presented in the tables above as well as stock level calls presented clearly point to one trend: analyst’s pre disposition to scream buy or hold rather than sell. We must say here that it is quite possible that we may have missed out on some recommendations especially those research notes that are proprietary and are not freely available for public viewing. In spite of this failing, we still believe that analysts are more prone to issue a buy/hold rating on a stock in GCC than sell.</span></span>

It is interesting to understand the psychology behind this phenomenon which we espoused in our earlier blog and we feel they still stand the test. Here is our list of reasoning:

1. Buy recommendations can be acted upon even by new investors (suits the agenda of sell side brokers) while sell recommendations can only be acted by those who hold them (small universe)

2. Sell recommendations are almost always unpopular with companies and hence will not serve investment banking needs and other favours.

3. Sell recommendations are not acted upon as much as buy recommendations as it means accepting a mistake. (Behavioural finance!). It is difficult to take small loss than a poor but positive return.

4. Analysts are well served by companies they research when they give buy recommendation. They will have more access to information (extremely critical in GCC) next time around since they are in good books of the company.

5. In the GCC, absence of derivatives market makes it difficult to action sell recommendations except by portfolio managers. Even where derivatives market enables one to short, since the loss on short position tends to be unlimited, it has limited application (given the risk management pressure).

For these reasons, we believe GCC will be a “buyers” market for some time to come.[:ar]<span style="color: #000000;">We have been regularly monitoring analysts’ recommendations in GCC and notice a weird trend. Most of the calls are either buy or hold. Look at the table below:

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<span style="color:#000000;">This is a strange pair of two markets, Saudi Arabia and India. One is a rich oil producer sitting on huge amount of wealth and is 7 times richer than India on a per capita basis. Another is a growing emerging market three times the size of Saudi Arabia.<br />
<br />
On the 31<sup>st</sup> of January 2005 the TASI index was at a modest 8,231 points while the SENSEX was at its modest 6,555 points. Since that date the TASI index peaked at 20,643 points on February 2006 while the SENSEX peaked to 20,873 points on August 2008. The global credit crisis in 2008 brought them down together (as they did to all the markets in the world) with their bottoms reaching during February 2009 shedding 79% and 56% respectively (from peak) of their values. However since that date SENSEX bounced back to post a return of over 200% while Saudi Arabia totters. This has created a chasm between the two markets in terms of long term returns. During the last 5 years, Sensex produced an annualized return of 23% against an annualized return of 13.5% for Saudi Arabia.<br />
<br />
<img alt="fall-together-image1.jpg" class="researchDemand" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Fall-Together-Rise-Alone-fig1.jpg" /><br />
<br />
Obviously this bounce back for India has produced some valuation excesses compared to Saudi Arabia. India currently trades at a p/e level of 17 (median is 17.4) while Saudi Arabia trades at 14 (median 14). Due to low valuation, Saudi offers better dividend yield (4.1%) compared to India&rsquo;s 1.3%.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
For the future, the following scenarios emerge:</span>
<ol>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;">The differential gap <strong><u>narrows</u></strong> with Saudi rising and India staying put or falling</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;">The differential gap <strong><u>widens </u></strong>with India keeping up the bull momentum and Saudi straying sideways as has been the trend of late</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;">The differential gap <strong><u>stays put</u></strong> with either both markets witnessing upward moment or both markets witnessing side way movement.</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="color:#000000;"> 2 years ago we suggested the above scenarios - fast forwarding today, the Indian market remains on its bull trajectory and the differential gap widened while Saudi remained tottering sideways on the back of a collapsing oil market and an endearing geopolitical risk from neighbouring countries.<br />

		<Title>[:en]Unified Stock Exchange for GCC[:ar]البورصة الموحدة لدول مجلس التعاون الخليجي[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<span style="color:#000000;">Several factors argue for the case for a unified stock exchange in the GCC region including increased trade volumes, improved liquidity and lower trading costs on back of economies of scale (<a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/mena-asset-management-policy-perspectives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>MENA Asset Management Policy Perspectives, Markaz Research</b></a>) . However, the first step towards such unification of stock exchanges requires the union of currencies and harmonizing of monetary operations undertaken by the GCC central banks.<br />
<br />
Initially proposed in the early 2000 after the successful adoption of the Euro, the approval for the new economic agreement came in 2001. The agreement included deadlines to establish the minimum requirements for the establishment of the GCC monetary union. The requirements included the standardization of banking regulations and the synchronization of monetary and fiscal policies.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, the deadline for the proposal for the adoption of a common currency, known as Khaleeji, by 2010 was plagued by several developments. The first was in 2006 when Oman opted out due to their inability to meet the required convergence criteria. All the GCC countries had earlier pegged their currencies to the US Dollar in January 2003 for the unification process, but when in May 2007 Kuwait removed its currency peg, the progress received a further blow. Kuwait blamed the rise in domestic inflation, double the historic average, stoked by sliding dollar which increased the cost of imports as the reason. In 2009, UAE also backed out of the proposal for a common currency after the other GCC countries provisionally agreed that Riyadh, Saudi Arabia would hold the Gulf Central bank for this common currency . UAE did not agree to the location of central bank decision and criticized the fact that most GCC institutions were headquartered in Saudi Arabia.<br />
<br />
Parallels in Europe, the adoption of the Euro helped eliminate the currency risk for investors and helped them to broaden their portfolios by taking part in cross-border investments. Though currency risk per se doesn&rsquo;t exist among GCC member countries as they all are pegged to the common currency (source: Arabnews, Gulfnews) and the peg is backed by substantial reserves, nonetheless the move would help in eliminating the frictional costs that the investor would incur when shifting from currency to another.<br />
<br />
In 2010, at a meeting in Riyadh, UAE floated an initiative aimed at integrating the securities markets of all the members of the GCC. They did not propose a single stock exchange but only a consolidation of rules and regulations, as the basic step before any other measures for further progress could follow. The proposal also included a strategy that would be implemented in steps over a certain period of time.<br />
<br />
Apart from removing the frictional costs, the unified currency can be advantageous in the following ways:</span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;">Strengthen bilateral trade and two-way investments between the GCC countries.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;">Ensure stability of prices in all commodities within the region.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;">Since the countries would be able to pay the regional imports in the new currency, this would allow them to no longer keep aside foreign exchange for the intra-trade transactions among GCC nations.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;">The integration of financial markets resulting in more potential investments.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color:#000000;"> Despite this, some experts believed that the unification of currencies will not serve any special purpose and considering the structural issues that the Gulf countries have, they would be better served by having an independent monetary policy which may not be possible in the case of a monetary union.<br />
<br />
Yet, if the GCC countries do succeed in adopting a common currency, resulting in a unified stock exchange, the benefits would be manifold. Some of them include:</span>

<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;">Well regulated unified stock market will change the way investors work with the management, changing the orientation and undertaking projects which create value for the investors. This change in orientation could mean better disclosures from the companies in terms of financials and better transparency in the operations of the firm.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;">It will create the required size and liquidity, i.e. the other low and mid cap stocks will also come into focus and not just the GCC bellwether stocks, necessary to attract the foreign institutional investors.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;">A competent single stock market can facilitate in the introduction of different financial products so desperately required in the GCC. For example, the availability of hedging products in the market could invite keen interest from the regional and international participants.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;">It may provide a better valuation for firms and help promote mergers and acquisitions.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;">A large unified stock market is also much better than a fragmented one in terms of integration into the global markets. This will help the countries counter the shocks or the fluctuations in the market they are currently vulnerable to.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color:#000000;"> Having said that, it is also worth mentioning that despite global integration the stock markets would still be susceptible to volatility due to the short term interests of global institutional investors.<br />

Unified GCC stock exchange would have a daily turnover value of USD 3.1billion and command a market capitalization of approx. USD 1billion, which is much higher than that of Brazil, South Africa or Russia. But to even think about the possibility of a unified stock exchange and to enjoy the benefits mentioned above, it needs to overcome the following challenges:</span>

<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;">An efficient stock market is highly correlated with a sound banking system so the supervision of banks and financial intermediaries to meet international standards should be adhered to.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;">Transparency and clarity in legislations is required if the stock market wants to compete internationally. (Gray, S. and Blejer, M., 2007. The Gulf Cooperation Council Region: financial market development, competitiveness, and economic growth)</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;">To boost the confidence in markets and to ensure equal participation, appropriate framework for the disclosure of material information should be established.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;">Strengthening the institutions that need to manage the single currency and enhancing the market infrastructure including trading platforms and settlement systems should be expedited.</span></li>
</ul>
<br />
<span style="color:#000000;">In 2010, officials from the four GCC nations of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar met to discuss the unified rules for the supervision of their banks ahead of the launch of the monetary union.<br />

		<Title>[:en]Are GCC businesses leveraging social media enough?[:ar]هل تسعى الشركات الخليجية إلى الاستفادة الكافية من وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي؟[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">This increasing reach, twinned with the growing presence of young people on social media, has opened up new avenues for companies to interact with their customers of the industries that are currently active on social channels across the region, the retail industry leads engagement on Facebook in almost all of the GCC countries, with over seven million active followers.<br />
<br />
This is followed by the telecommunications industry at close to five million users. While the remaining top five industries in the GCC, based on the number of Facebook followers, are e-commerce, electronics and airlines. The most used social media channels for businesses in the region are Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.<br />
<br />
In terms of the total number of fans on Facebook, the fast moving consumer goods industry is one of the most popular in the region. According to recent industry estimates, the GCC&rsquo;s FMCG market will likely cross the $270bn mark by 2018, with the regional population expected to expand to around 56.5 million. Faced with ever increasing competition, it is becoming crucial for FMCG companies to increase their visibility in the market by tapping social media and engaging with end users.<br />
<br />
Qatar Airways has a significant presence across all social media platforms and the largest number of followers compared to its regional competitors with a Facebook fan following of 11.6 million people. This features news, videos, pictures of the cabin crew at new and interesting destinations, and other elements aimed at engaging with existing and potential customers.<br />
<br />
The airline also has a Twitter account with close to a million followers, and a YouTube channel with more than 36,000 subscribers.<br />
<br />
In the retail industry, Arabian Oud, with 4 million Facebook and 1.5 million Twitter followers leads the pack. In telecoms, STC and Mobily have a stronger presence on Twitter compared to Facebook, and Souq.com dominates social media outreach in e-commerce, with 8 million Facebook followers and 380,000 Twitter followers.<br />
<br />
The social media presence of SMEs is also on the rise, according to a 2015 survey of 260 regional SMEs by LinkedIn. In the study, 92 per cent of respondents said they were already on social media platforms, with a further 5 per cent preparing to establish a presence. Many of these will surely have taken the plunge since the survey was conducted.<br />
<br />
The main driving factor in the adoption of social media was found to be the ease of generating business, with 34 per cent of Gulf SMEs claiming that they gained new customers through social media advertising and 32 per cent directly linking their social ad spend to revenue growth.<br />
<br />
However, other industries like banking have a very limited presence on social media platforms, or are not using them to their full potential. Banks in the region should look at social media as more than a simple marketing tool. They should see it as an essential factor to develop actionable insights and gain real value from consumer interaction, especially at a time when fintech solutions are threatening existing business models across the globe.<br />
<br />
There are a few exceptions to the overall trend of banks in the region underutilising social media channels. Some such as QNB, Saudi Investment Bank and Emirates NBD have significant fan followings on Facebook. QNB&rsquo;s posts on Facebook are related to the products and services it offers, the financial performance of the group and its social initiatives. The bank also has a reasonable presence on both Twitter and YouTube, unlike other GCC banks.<br />
<br />
Social media can be used as a marketing tool to help businesses achieve growth, improve brand image, procure talent, and become more consumer-centric. Especially by getting, feeding and addressing complaints.<br />
With growing internet and smartphone penetration, and rapid advancements in technology, it has become imperative for businesses to engage with customers or risk losing out to competition. And while challenges exist &ndash; such as lack of Arabic content and data security &ndash; the benefits outweigh the costs.<br />
<br />
But tools used to enhance brand image can also be used to tarnish it. For example, Subaru Emirates paid a hefty price for social media mismanagement after a road accident occurred that claimed four lives. The company was branded sexist and insensitive after posting an image of the accident with the status &ldquo;woman driver at it again&rdquo;. By the time it was taken down 26 hours later the damage had been done.<br />
<br />
Another issue faced by companies is that it is difficult to quantitatively assess the impact of social media activities on business growth. It can be cumbersome to measure a return on investment, so many do not go through the process.<br />
<br />
Digital and social network ad spending in the Middle East and North Africa region is below the global average and significantly lower than other parts of the world such as North America and Europe. It can therefore be said that GCC businesses have not fully realised the potential of social media, despite rapidly growing MENA expenditure.<br />
<br />
Businesses in the region have, however, recognised the importance of engaging with their customer base to improve both their reach and operational efficiency.<br />
<br />
With penetration figures continuing to rise, and social platforms becoming increasingly prevalent in every aspect of our lives, customer engagement and ad spending is sure to grow in response.<br />
<br />
So while GCC businesses might not be leveraging social media to its fullest potential, they are fast making up ground and we can expect much more activity in the months ahead.</div>[:ar]<div style="text-align: justify;">This increasing reach, twinned with the growing presence of young people on social media, has opened up new avenues for companies to interact with their customers of the industries that are currently active on social channels across the region, the retail industry leads engagement on Facebook in almost all of the GCC countries, with over seven million active followers.<br />

		<Title>[:en]Can Robot Advisors Succeed in the GCC?[:ar]هل يمكن للمستشارين الآليين أن ينجحوا في دول مجلس التعاون الخليجي؟[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">This new breed of investment advisory services currently has close to $100 Bn of Assets under Management (AUMs) in the US market which has a size of close to $30 Tn. At its current adoption rate, Deloitte predicts that robo-advisory services could be managing $5Tn - $7Tn by 2025. Big brands like Charles Schwab, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch etc. have jumped in the race to offer such services to their clients which is expected to largely increase the adoption of this technology.<br />
<br />
<strong>Potential in the GCC region</strong><br />
According to BCG&rsquo;s 2015 Global wealth report, private Wealth in Middle East and Africa(MEA) region increased by more than 7% to surpass $8 trn in 2014. It is expected to maintain similar levels of growth till 2019 and is expected to increase to $13 tn by then. Saudi Arabia and UAE are expected to be the two major markets with total private wealth of $2 tn and $1 tn respectively. Middle East and Africa&rsquo;s wealth accounts for 5% of the global wealth in 2014 which is expected to increase to 6% by 2019. The growth and distribution of private wealth in the Middle East and GCC region does not bode well for the robo-advisory services in the region.<br />
<br />
Privacy of wealth is also of paramount importance in the region as a result of which private banking has been the most preferred route for investors in the region.&nbsp; Western private bankers command about 70% of the assets as of June 2015 with regional banks developing their own private banking offerings. It is only recently that HNIs in the region have preferred to keep both their assets and business home. Owing to the huge scale of wealth that these HNWIs and UHNWIs have, their investment requirements are far more demanding than that of retail investors. Issues that these investors have to overcome for their global portfolios include &ndash; taxation, international regulation (Money laundering, KYC norms), estate planning etc. which the automated robot advisory services are ill-equipped to handle.<br />
<br />
Ultra High Net worth Individuals and upper High net worth individuals combined account for 73% of the wealth in the GCC region according to Strategy&. These investors typically have complex investment requirements that is spread over continents and countries which is one of the reason why they choose private banking. Private banking offers them discretion and secrecy in their transactions.&nbsp; While we can certainly rule-out the possibility of robo-adviors gaining enough knowledge to service these individuals the lower high net worth and the mass affluent segment can prove to be a an ideal market for the technology. Individuals in these segments mostly would have some sort of investment advisory relationship with the regional banks which can be explored and built on.<br />
<br />
For instance a regional bank tying up with globally recognised robo-advisory services can turn around the rules of the game very quickly in the GCC market few years down the line. While the thought of robo-advisory completely taking over one&rsquo;s investments is a remote possibility, it can be mellowed down via a hybrid model. The hybrid model involves automated recommendations which are then supplemented by a more personal advice from a finance professional. This segment which balances the best of both worlds is expected to grow to $16.3tn worldwide over the next nine years globally (2025).<br />
<br />
<img alt="Middle East Wealth Distribution" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Robot-Advisors-fig1.jpg" /><br />
While the prospects for a hybrid model seems very attractive there are still areas which needs to be re-visited often which includes regulations that would govern the product and how it is being sold to the customers. Robo-advisory is not expected to take over the market anytime soon; however a sizeable portion of the wealth managers will have to adapt to it in the years to come.<br />
<br />
<strong>A flurry of deals</strong><br />
Robot advisory is currently in a nascent stage but it is expanding fast which has piqued the interest of the top banks and brokerages across the globe. Currently over 200 robo-advice platforms now exist in the US and activity is also picking up in Europe where there has been a series of deals that have been completed recently. Prominent ones include Schroders&rsquo; acquiring a stake in Nutmeg and Aberdeen Asset Management buying Parmenion Capital partners.&nbsp; Across the Atlantic, Fidelity investments announced partnership with Betterment and LearnVest. Vanguard for its part is adding a hybrid model to its offerings that allows for human contact if necessary. Consensus among the players in the industry is that robo-advisory would result in a seismic shift in the wealth management industry. However critics of the technology are quick to point out that there are areas, such as holistic financial planning, inheritance, retirement and tax advice, where human advisors are absolute necessity.<br />
<br />
<img alt="Who controls the market? & Pros vs. Cons" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Robot-Advisors-fig2-3.jpg" /><br />
<strong>Will traditional advisors go out of favour?</strong><br />
Robot-advisors do threaten the traditional advisors however they are expected to remain relevant for decades to come as years of human experience is something that is hard to replicate. For instance High Net worth individuals and large institutional investors still prefer the touch of human advisors to guide them on a multitude issues such as Investment laws, wealth management and inheritance. Understanding the laws and regulations of different countries and continents is of paramount importance that concerns the client which is expected to remain in the hands of human advisors. While HNIs could toy with the idea of allocating a part of their portfolio to robo-advisory it could take many decades before computers can learn to replicate the services of the human advisors completely. Robot-advisory services instead is expected to bring in small investors (read millennial, tech-savvy) into the picture.<br />

At its current adoption rate, Deloitte predicts that robo-advisory services could be managing $5Tn - $7Tn by 2025. Big brands like Charles Schwab, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch etc. have jumped in the race to offer such services to their clients which is expected to largely increase the adoption of this technology.<br />
<br />
<strong>Potential in the GCC region</strong><br />
According to BCG&rsquo;s 2015 Global wealth report, private Wealth in Middle East and Africa(MEA) region increased by more than 7% to surpass $8 trn in 2014. It is expected to maintain similar levels of growth till 2019 and is expected to increase to $13 tn by then. Saudi Arabia and UAE are expected to be the two major markets with total private wealth of $2 tn and $1 tn respectively. Middle East and Africa&rsquo;s wealth accounts for 5% of the global wealth in 2014 which is expected to increase to 6% by 2019. The growth and distribution of private wealth in the Middle East and GCC region does not bode well for the robo-advisory services in the region.<br />
<br />
Privacy of wealth is also of paramount importance in the region as a result of which private banking has been the most preferred route for investors in the region.&nbsp; Western private bankers command about 70% of the assets as of June 2015 with regional banks developing their own private banking offerings. It is only recently that HNIs in the region have preferred to keep both their assets and business home. Owing to the huge scale of wealth that these HNWIs and UHNWIs have, their investment requirements are far more demanding than that of retail investors. Issues that these investors have to overcome for their global portfolios include &ndash; taxation, international regulation (Money laundering, KYC norms), estate planning etc. which the automated robot advisory services are ill-equipped to handle.<br />
<br />
Ultra High Net worth Individuals and upper High net worth individuals combined account for 73% of the wealth in the GCC region according to Strategy&amp;. These investors typically have complex investment requirements that is spread over continents and countries which is one of the reason why they choose private banking. Private banking offers them discretion and secrecy in their transactions.&nbsp; While we can certainly rule-out the possibility of robo-adviors gaining enough knowledge to service these individuals the lower high net worth and the mass affluent segment can prove to be a an ideal market for the technology. Individuals in these segments mostly would have some sort of investment advisory relationship with the regional banks which can be explored and built on.<br />
<br />
For instance a regional bank tying up with globally recognised robo-advisory services can turn around the rules of the game very quickly in the GCC market few years down the line. While the thought of robo-advisory completely taking over one&rsquo;s investments is a remote possibility, it can be mellowed down via a hybrid model. The hybrid model involves automated recommendations which are then supplemented by a more personal advice from a finance professional. This segment which balances the best of both worlds is expected to grow to $16.3tn worldwide over the next nine years globally (2025).<br />
<br />
<img alt="Middle East Wealth Distribution" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Robot-Advisors-fig1.jpg" /><br />
While the prospects for a hybrid model seems very attractive there are still areas which needs to be re-visited often which includes regulations that would govern the product and how it is being sold to the customers. Robo-advisory is not expected to take over the market anytime soon; however a sizeable portion of the wealth managers will have to adapt to it in the years to come.<br />
<br />
<strong>A flurry of deals</strong><br />
Robot advisory is currently in a nascent stage but it is expanding fast which has piqued the interest of the top banks and brokerages across the globe. Currently over 200 robo-advice platforms now exist in the US and activity is also picking up in Europe where there has been a series of deals that have been completed recently. Prominent ones include Schroders&rsquo; acquiring a stake in Nutmeg and Aberdeen Asset Management buying Parmenion Capital partners.&nbsp; Across the Atlantic, Fidelity investments announced partnership with Betterment and LearnVest. Vanguard for its part is adding a hybrid model to its offerings that allows for human contact if necessary. Consensus among the players in the industry is that robo-advisory would result in a seismic shift in the wealth management industry. However critics of the technology are quick to point out that there are areas, such as holistic financial planning, inheritance, retirement and tax advice, where human advisors are absolute necessity.<br />
<br />
<img alt="Who controls the market? &amp; Pros vs. Cons" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Robot-Advisors-fig2-3.jpg" /><br />
<strong>Will traditional advisors go out of favour?</strong><br />
Robot-advisors do threaten the traditional advisors however they are expected to remain relevant for decades to come as years of human experience is something that is hard to replicate. For instance High Net worth individuals and large institutional investors still prefer the touch of human advisors to guide them on a multitude issues such as Investment laws, wealth management and inheritance. Understanding the laws and regulations of different countries and continents is of paramount importance that concerns the client which is expected to remain in the hands of human advisors. While HNIs could toy with the idea of allocating a part of their portfolio to robo-advisory it could take many decades before computers can learn to replicate the services of the human advisors completely. Robot-advisory services instead is expected to bring in small investors (read millennial, tech-savvy) into the picture.<br />

		<Title>[:en]From a slow start, innovative fintech could shake up finance in the GCC[:ar]من البداية البطيئة، يمكن أن تُحدث تقنية فينتيك المبتكرة تعديل جذري في الموارد المالية في دول مجلس التعاون الخليجي[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">In the West, governments play the role of facilitator in terms of policy and regulation, and in providing the right environment for innovation to flourish, leaving it to the private sector to come up with solutions. However, in the GCC, with regulations lagging in most sectors and the private sector wary of joining in, governments play a more central role in fostering innovation.<br />
<br />
Still, fintech has begun to bubble up across the region, in payment systems (CashU), peer-to-peer lending (Beehive), crowdfunding (Eureeca, Aflamnah and Durise), online/mobile banking and online trading.<br />
<br />
Even though cash is still king, the use of online banking, plastic cards and alternate payment systems, such as CashU, are slowly rising in popularity, mainly because of increasing e-commerce transactions. But mobile banking does not have many takers, mostly because of a lack of user-friendly interfaces, which should change over time.<br />
<br />
Crowdfunding is one area where fintech has begun to show its potential in the region. Although it may not replace the traditional sources of funding, such as banks, private equity and venture capital, crowdfunding has provided another option for a region that is facing a severe liquidity crunch. In addition, crowdfunding, at times, focuses on motives beyond financial return, as in the case of Qatar&rsquo;s Silatech, which has joined hands with Qatar Charity to launch a crowdfunding platform dedicated to funding young Arab entrepreneurs.<br />
<br />
Fintech&rsquo;s penetration into Islamic finance is still in its infancy with very few participants, such as Beehive, a Dubai-based Sharia-compliant P2P lender. However, the potential disruptions to traditional Islamic finance cannot be underestimated. From a consumer perspective, fintech provides more choices that suit individual needs at competitive cost and with easier access. SMEs that find it hard to obtain bank funding from Islamic financial institutions (IFIs) could look to fintechs to fill that gap, via Sharia-compliant P2P lending and crowdfunding platforms.<br />
<br />
But the biggest potential impact of fintech would be the increase in reach of Islamic financial services, as an alternative to conventional finance, especially in markets where it is yet to enter. Fintech eating into IFI margins will force the latter to provide more services online and standardise offerings to customers.<br />
<br />
Other areas where fintech is likely to have an impact, especially from a GCC standpoint, are remittances, insurance, investment advisory and online trading.<br />
<br />
The arrival of online insurance marketplaces will lead to a homogenisation of risks and a complete overhaul of traditional channels of distribution. Technology companies could enter the insurance distribution space, leveraging on their extensive data collection and distribution capabilities, and charge insurers a fixed fee for every customer click.<br />
<br />
According to the World Bank, the cost to a diaspora of sending money home averages 7.7 per cent globally. India, which receives the highest remittances from the Gulf region and worldwide, loses US$5 billion annually in bank transfer costs. Despite regulatory hassles in some places, fintech companies have entered the remittance space and are cutting out the middlemen.<br />
<br />
So how close is the GCC to celebrating this fintech revolution? Currently, it is still at a nascent stage in most areas where fintech could have a potential impact. These technologies will most certainly affect the businesses of the banking, financial services and insurance industry, the biggest and most prominent sector in the region after oil and petrochemicals.<br />
<br />
In terms of policy and regulation, the GCC still lags behind the rest of the world and change takes an inordinate amount of time to occur. However, demand from consumers is expected to give rise to faster adoption across the region. This is one revolution the GCC won&rsquo;t be able to sidestep.<br />

		<Title>[:en]Bitcoins - What’s the story now?[:ar]بيتكوين - ما هي القصة الآن؟[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]Last year we had published a report (Disruptive Technology: Bitcoins) on the emerging technology of bitcoins. At the time of writing that report, the value of one bitcoin had reached an all-time high of $979 against the US dollar and was touted as an important tool in the future of finance. However, one year down the line, things are not looking bright for bitcoins. It started with the closure of Mt.Gox; one of the biggest bitcoin exchanges and  was followed by closure of many other bitcoin exchanges (big and small). Canadian bitcoin exchange (Cavirtex), California based Butter coin (backed by Google), London based Yacuna are some of the major bitcoin exchanges to shut down in recent times.  Shutting down of the exchanges is not without its consequences as investors and stakeholders lost their money entirely and expensive lawsuits followed. In this blog, we look at major events that have happened in the world of bitcoins during the past one year.

<strong>Bitcoin vs USD - Prices</strong>
<img style="width: 669px; height: 365px;" title="Bitcoin-Vs-USD-Prices.JPG" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Bitcoins-fig1.jpg" alt="Bitcoin-Vs-USD-Prices.JPG" />

<strong>Splitting in two (more like three)</strong>
<img style="width: 579px; height: 216px;" title="Splitting-in-two.JPG" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Bitcoins-fig2.jpg" alt="Splitting-in-two.JPG" />

We in our earlier report (Disruptive Technology: Bitcoins) had highlighted the underlying technology of bitcoin - “Block chain” technology. Block chain is a public record of all the transactions that happen in the bitcoin world. Each block records a certain number of transactions and once the blocks are exhausted the transactions are recorded onto a new block. Each computer (called “nodes”) receives a copy of the bitcoin transactions that have taken place. All the transactions that take place in the bitcoin network get disseminated to the users of the network. These transactions are then confirmed (usually within 10 mins) through a process called mining which ensures chronological order of transactions, neutrality of network and allows computers to reach a consensus on the transactions.

In recent times there has been a dramatic shift in focus from bitcoin’s use as an alternative currency and store of value to the possibilities surrounding the underlying distributed ledger technology, or blockchain. Big companies in the market are trying to adopt and tap the potential of the technology for non-currency based transactions. Investment in block chain technology has caught the interest of Wall Street with some of the biggest players in the finance and financial technologies space having invested in this technology.  Visa, NASDAQ, Citi and few others have invested $30 million in Chain.com, a blockchain developer platform that serves an enterprise market. With the $30 million funding that the company has risen, in addition to the $13.5 funding that it already has in the bank, the company predicts healthy revenues and turning profitable next year.
In this investment and other investments that surround the block chain technology, attempts have been made to bring some key qualities of block chains- such as transparency, security and cost-effectiveness to main stream financial transactions. This distributed ledger technology is expected to bring a whole series of changes to the existing legacy systems. Investors see a huge potential for such technologies in the future when most of the assets would be digital. When asked about the investment in the company, Visa’s executive vice president said that they are looking for investments in technology outside of point of sale (an area that it already has tight control on) and in new areas such as business-to-business spending or business-to-government spending which is a much larger pie and it’s an area in which Visa have very little penetration.

Investments in block chain by major banks are not only confined to the US, across the Atlantic, Barclays bank has invested in two block chain startups – Wave and Chain analysis. Barclays has been most vocal about its investment in this space in the past few months (as of Oct 2015).In addition to the strong verbal support Barclays bank has also opened two block chain labs in its old bank branches.

Even bitcoin startups have announced new blockchain initiatives. For instance, US exchange itBit revealed its bank chain product, and Ripple announced its Interledger initiative to connect various distributed ledgers. Reduction in volume of bitcoins as well as lukewarm response for bitcoin payments has forced the hands of bitcoin companies to innovate or perish. More bitcoin companies are expected to follow suit.

<strong>Investments slowdown</strong>

Total bitcoin venture capital increased 11% to $921m in Q3 2015. While all-time bitcoin investment is on track to surpass $1bn in 2015, there has been a slowdown in the pace of investment.

While it is still unclear at this stage if there is any particularly noteworthy reason behind the observed slowdown in investment; it may reflect something significant such as the venture capital community’s concerns over the speed of adoption, or something insignificant like seasonal factors. Bankruptcies and increasing competition in exchanges and bitcoin mining has forced its hands at consolidation in the sector.

<strong>M&A in Bitcoin technologies</strong>
<img style="width: 533px; height: 260px;" title="M-A-bitcoin.JPG" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Bitcoins-fig4.jpg" alt="M-A-bitcoin.JPG" />

<span style="line-height: 20.8px;">Source: CoinDesk</span>

Payment processor and wallet startups have seen little-to-no venture capital investment over the last several quarters possibly due to sluggish global economy.

Bitcoin’s failure to gain significant traction as a medium of exchange for non-illicit transactions is playing spoil sport for the payment processing sector. For example, BitPay, which is one of the most well-financed startups in the space, announced significant staff cuts and that it will no longer offer its ‘free and unlimited’ introductory service to new merchants looking to accept bitcoin as payment.

Challenges associated with the adoption of new payment methods are not unique to bitcoin. For example, Apple Pay, Google Wallet and a number of other payment services have failed to achieve critical mass required to sustain its early momentum and gain wider use despite the tremendous publicity surrounding the announcement of such payment services.

<strong>Bitcoin community split into two</strong>
Bitcoin transactions are packaged into blocks before being recorded on bitcoin's permanent ledger. Developers disagree over what the maximum size of those blocks should be. On one hand, smaller means more security, but on the other hand bigger means that bitcoin technology can more easily scale into wider adoption and non-currency applications. While this might sound very technical, some users of bitcoins suggest that increasing the block size could possibly render bitcoins worthless adding an additional layer of risk.

In addition to this, there are also other issues to consider for Bitcoins such as Regulation (Banking sector which currently looks like its only savior is a heavily regulated one and is in opposite spectrum of bitcoins which is unregulated and decentralized), Public adoption (Key to long term success)as well as reduced funding. Lean business models and frugality are the order of the day for bitcoin companies in 2016.

People in Dubai and Saudi Arabia love to shop in malls. Dubai has two shopping festivals in a year and the number of malls in GCC is growing, as more companies prefer brick and mortar stores.<br />
<br />
In the GCC, e-commerce is still at its nascent stage. According to BQ Doha, while 90% of global e-commerce sales come from Asia-Pacific, North America and Western Europe; while GCC accounts for a mere 2% of total retail sales.<br />
<br />
UAE has a strong B2C infrastructure and enjoys the highest smartphone, Internet and card payment penetration. According to Emirates NBD, 60% of GCC e-commerce volume comes from UAE. Saudi Arabia comes second, and AT Kearny has listed that country as being among the top 30 markets for e-commerce. The following table shows the size of online retail market in GCC countries.<br />

GCC countries consume as much power as the US and Euro Zone countries. ICT infrastructure development has improved Internet speed, bandwidth per Internet user and improved security.<br />
<br />
The population in the GCC is growing, so is Internet penetration and mobile Internet access. The population of tech-hungry young people, with a taste for branded products is also on the rise. Consumers are increasingly aware about product offers and prices through user reviews, product comparisons and ratings. Online shopping has become secure. Retailers are becoming aware of benefits such as lower operational costs, wider customer reach and ease of switching suppliers and vendors. All these have opened up a huge potential for e-commerce in the region.<br />
<br />
<strong>There are several sectors that can tap online selling:</strong><br />
<br />
<u><strong>Healthcare</strong></u><br />
There is a huge demand and supply gap in healthcare. The private sector is developing health infrastructure and due to this there is huge scope for e-retail like online bookings and appointments, maintaining medical records and availing discounts.<br />
<br />
<u><strong>Pharmaceuticals</strong></u><br />
This sector has not been attracting online sellers. The best way to start could be In-store kiosks, web orders with e-retail model. Pharmacies can adopt e-retail where orders can be placed on line when stock needs to be replenished. It will be a good model to be adopted to prevent loss of customers.<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Education</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />
Education is seeing a growth phase with Gulf countries increasing expenditure on education and encouraging private investment. Again, there is a demand and supply gap between workforce skill sets and industry requirements. To fill the gap, several steps like tie-ups with global universities, online study materials, web-classes and online correspondence courses could be initiated. Literacy rates in the GCC are increasing leading to higher female readership and greater acceptance of e-books. These could boost online education and fill the industry gaps.<br />
<br />
<u><strong>Clothing and Cosmetics</strong></u><br />
Gulf countries are generally conservative about women venturing into public places on their own. Cosmetics companies can fill the gap by introducing online web-catalogues accepting online orders, and provide shipping, to boost their sales.<br />
<br />
<u><strong>Gaming</strong></u><br />
Online gamers have increased. Players in Qatar like to play in gaming lounges while those in UAE like to buy and play at home. T-break Media, the host of the first International Gaming Convention in Qatar has estimated that the gaming industry in GCC is worth USD 2.6 billion and is expected to triple in ten years! Game developers can tap this potential through online platforms.<br />
<br />
<u><strong>Online stores by hypermarkets</strong></u><br />
The GCC has about 150 supermarkets and hypermarkets. The retail demand is very high. Retailers in Saudi Arabia prefer physical model, as online channel did not work for them due to low consumer awareness, low demand, poor Internet penetration and low credit card usage. However, there are areas that can be tapped for online penetration. The restrictive driving regulations for women are a good potential for retailers to make delivery of groceries through online purchases.<br />
<br />
The potential for online hypermarkets, supermarkets and convenient stores is huge as they can offer a comprehensive product range in a single platform. Web promotions, and group buying or the bricks and clicks model, third party logistics operator, will help consolidate costs.<br />
<br />
The sector scope is huge. However, there is a gap between e-retail and how consumers perceive e-retail, due to which it is not so popular.<br />
<br />
Takers for e-retail in the GCC are mostly the youth, women and single men.<br />
<br />
When it comes to sellers, international players like Amazon and e-bay and local players like Souq in UAE, Jadopado, LuLu, 3M Gulf, Cobone, Alatoolmuscat etc. are doing well. Group buying sites such as Cobone, GoNabit, Groupon are very popular, especially for hotel bookings, dining, holiday deals, spa and beauty.<br />
<br />
Broadband and smartphone penetration is increasing. People now have access to fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) technology that provides higher bandwidth and faster Internet experience. Security for online payments has improved. Websites offer cash-on-delivery, Debit/Credit cards, online banking, invoice, PayPal, cheque, gift cards, vouchers, bit-coins and crypto-currencies, for online shopping. As per <a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/gcc-online-retail/" target="_blank" title="GCC Online Research Report" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marmore Report, <b><em>GCC Online Retail</em> </b>,</a> &ldquo;Secure online payment firm PayPal, in association with Aramex, launched its &lsquo;Shop & Ship&rsquo; service in the GCC countries that enables consumers to link their PayPal accounts to their local Visa, MasterCard, or Amex debit / credit cards that are issued locally. This enables consumers to make faster and more convenient online purchases from overseas vendors&rdquo;.<br />
<br />
However, a major drawback is the lack of support from advanced logistics network, especially in Saudi Arabia. This is due to labor issues and poor logistics infrastructure. A second drawback is the gap in demand and supply of technical experts in e-commerce and customer support roles, which can be filled by nationals who are being encouraged to take up higher education in these areas.<br />
<br />
In the UAE, a legislative and regulatory framework has been introduced to facilitate e-commerce growth. Once the other GCC governments follow suit, several areas like trademarks, copyrights, cyber-frauds, payments security and data theft need to be addressed to support its growth.<br />
<br />
The fact that e-commerce helps reduce operational costs and infrastructure is yet to be fully perceived by retailers in this region. Adoption of better promotion strategies are required to boost sales of products like clothing, books, consumer durables and entertainment which are less popular than consumer electronics and travel bookings that sell better online.<br />
<br />
All that is needed is wider consumer awareness and a shift in preference to online convenience shopping for daily consumer durables and eatables as well as other areas to make e-commerce a success.<br />

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<strong>KEY QUESTION 1: How far have the GCC countries ventured into social media?</strong>

The social media has offered the population in GCC countries an opportunity to express themselves and access more information. According to the <a href="http://www.arabsocialmediareport.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arab Social Media Report, 2012</a>, the Gulf States are now more tolerant of different points of view and are more aware of events happening globally because of their growing presence in social media.

They are taking to the new medium as a duck would take to the water. Saudi Arabia, for instance, has 82% of its population on social media. Its use of Twitter per capita is the highest in the world. Mobile penetration in the Middle East is 110%. Age distribution of Facebook users for GCC states is also quite interesting. <a title="GCC Social Media Research Report" href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/gcc-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marmore’s GCC Social Media Report</a> suggests that most users fall in the age group of 25-34 years (48 per cent) followed by 18-24 (22 per cent) & 35-44 (17 per cent).

YouTube has given the Saudi youth a platform to access different forms of entertainment. It also fosters cultural integration as most of the videos that Saudi youth watch are provided by the region’s entertainment hub, Egypt.

Social media has impacted the GCC countries politically too. ‘Bahrain online’ has been hosting lively debates on domestic politics and discrimination since 1999. ‘We are all Khalid Said,' a Facebook page created by a Google executive, kindled the Egyptian Revolution of 2011.

Business houses are also finding it useful in product promotions. When required to communicate to a multilingual audience, efficient use of infographics and other visual elements help overcome language barriers. 88% of tweets in UAE, 87% in Qatar and 78% of tweets in Kuwait are in English. The social media has clearly impacted the GCC countries economically, politically, and culturally.

<strong>KEY QUESTION 2: Do business houses in GCC succeed in creating business value through social media?</strong>

More than 35% (YouGov report) of the company houses in the GCC region use social media. Last year, about 10% of the total advertising cost for the MENA region was on digital advertising. It is expected to reach USD 2.8 billion by 2016. As more than 94% (Gartner report) of the users’ access social media through smartphones, companies are now tailoring their ads to enhance the mobile experience. Recently, Pepsi Arabia promoted their “Live for Now” identity through social media and people now associate #YallaNow (campaign slogan) with Pepsi in the region.

In February 2015, the UAE government, through Dubai Media Office, launched a highly successful social media campaign to recognize the contribution of armed forces in strengthening national interests. Further, companies tap on the increased Internet activity during festival seasons to pitch their products. Cincinnati-based household products manufacturer, Proctor & Gamble, advertises its entire product range during Ramadan, the season, which sees YouTube viewership increase by 20 to 30%. As P&G’s media head Ali Faruqi said, “It wants to be where the consumer is." Also, marketing personnel are cleverly crafting social media campaigns by helping users with their general queries and then tailoring their product offering to suit the customer’s needs. #EtihadSuggests, a campaign launched by Etihad Airways is attempting to personalize its social media offering by giving users general tips on travel and stay. After showing its restaurants, hotels, etc., it shows a special offer to book through Etihad Holidays. It was only after the Arab Spring that companies realized the power of social media in engaging with consumers, especially with Twitter, which has seen a far more rapid growth than Facebook.

Social media is also now being used a primary source of recruitment in MENA regions. Research done by Adecco showed that 47% of job seekers utilize social media for job search purposes. As per a recent survey, the top four reasons for using social media for job-related activities were:
<ul>
 	<li>Researching potential employers’ page,</li>
 	<li>Searching for suitable jobs,</li>
 	<li>Professional networking, and</li>
 	<li>Getting to know what others have to say about potential employers.</li>
</ul>
<strong>KEY QUESTION 3: Have there been instances of misuse of social media?</strong>

Yes. Companies, politicians, governments and media have been made the victim to such cyber-attacks, worldwide. According to Nexgate’s report, two out of every five Facebook accounts, claiming to represent a Fortune-100 brand are unauthorized. Cumulatively, Fortune-100 companies experience at least one compromise on their social media account every day. Such instances of misuse not only hurt the brand image of such companies, but the cost emanating from social media abuse is also very high. Recently, an American restaurant chain, Chipotle, became a victim of hackers’ attack on its Twitter account. The hackers not only changed their profile picture to that of swastika avatar, they also posted offensive content on their Twitter handle. Although it was not responsible for such tweets, the Company had to issue an apology in embarrassment. On 10th May 2015, ‘Flight 650’ which had 128 passengers on board, was diverted to a military air base in Dubai following threat posts on Etihad Airways’ Twitter account. Later, on inspection, no suspicion or danger was established.

A threat of such misuse is here to stay since business houses have only recently begun to exploit the advantages of social media and as this channel of communication is still at its nascent stage. However, business houses can take pre-emptive steps to protect themselves from such malicious phishing attacks and other cyber crimes.

<strong>KEY QUESTION 4: What are the precautions that can be taken by business houses to minimize the misuse of social media?</strong>

Here’s a quick list of six.
<ol>
 	<li>Choose a better password combination.</li>
 	<li>Restrict access to employees to official social media accounts.</li>
 	<li>Familiarity with the medium can lead to employees, including those accustomed to handling confidential information, letting their guards down. Companies must regularly train their employees on the prudent use of social media and update them on the privacy and confidentiality clauses.</li>
 	<li>Undertake risk assessment procedures to identify vulnerabilities and periodic evaluation of the effectiveness of the system to prevent such attacks is a good starting point.</li>
 	<li>Companies must tread carefully while posting online content or conducting social media campaigns keeping in mind the religious sensitivities and conservative lifestyle of the GCC region.</li>
 	<li>Social media, Twitter and Facebook, in particular, is being used as a tool for political resistance in the region. Although GCC has been immune to it due to better economic growth, business houses need to be careful that their social media accounts are not used as a tool for political propaganda and that their online content remains neutral.</li>
</ol>
<strong>KEY QUESTION 5: Do benefits of Social media outweigh its threats?</strong>

Social media is increasingly becoming a tool for companies to engage with its customers in a better way. It provides a wealth of information about a consumer: his likes, dislikes, tastes, clothing, lifestyle and other preferences, thereby giving the companies better opportunities to engage with him and introduce new products that satisfy his wants. Although the threat of the misuse of social media activity is here to stay if carefully used, entrepreneurs and businesses in MENA region can reap the benefits of social media and generate more revenue for their businesses.

		<Title>[:en]Crowdfunding in the GCC[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<strong>KEY QUESTION 1: What is Crowd funding? How is it gaining at the global level?</strong>

Officially, Crowdfunding stands for “<strong>Capital Raising Online While Deterring Fraud and Unethical Non-Disclosure</strong>”.

Here, a venture is funded by a large number of people, via the Internet, and this concept has gained massive popularity world-over. According to a report by <a href="http://thecrowdfundingcentre.com/datacenter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Crowd Data Center</em></a>, in 2014, each metric in crowdfunding is doubling every two months thanks to disruptive shifts in capital formation. This trend has found its way to the GCC nations also, as global sites such as Indiegogo and Kickstarter have attracted many hopeful GCC fundraisers and paired them with investors. Exclusive crowdfunding sites in the Arab region, such as Zoomal and Aflamnah have come up in the recent past.

<strong>KEY QUESTION 2: What are the types of crowd funding?</strong>

There are four main types of crowdfunding :–
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Donation Based: </strong>The funds are contributed for a charitable cause. The feeling of being a part of a good cause is the only reward that funders receive.</li>
 	<li><strong>Equity Based:</strong> The investors receive a stake in the company they are investing in.</li>
 	<li><strong>Reward Based– </strong>The investors receive a product or service from the fundraising company. The rewards are generally proportional to the investment made. For instance, someone who invested in the project THIS toothbrush for the below values will get the corresponding reward.
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
 	<li>USD 10 – Postcard + Gratitude</li>
 	<li>USD 25 – Standard Carrying Case + Refill Pack</li>
 	<li>USD 50 – Colored Carrying Case + Flavored Refill Pack and so on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><strong>Lending Based – </strong>Here the funds are repaid to the investors over a period of time.</li>
</ul>
<strong>KEY QUESTION 3: What is the need for crowd funding and how does it help in providing employment?</strong>

GCC states face high youth unemployment rates. Against the average total unemployment rate of 4.7 percent for GCC nations, the average youth unemployment rate is a massive 18 per cent. IMF predicts another 100,000 Kuwaitis to be employment-ready by 2016. With such high demographics, employment generation has to be a priority. The public sector currently contributes majorly towards employment. The increasing employable population will have to seek recourse in the private sector, and that would require promoting entrepreneurship, SMEs, family owned businesses and growth companies.
There remains a gap between ambitious young men and women, and the right funding to support their dreams in GCC. It is rather difficult for a SME or a budding entrepreneur or a riskier growth company to get loans from banks due to their stricter credit standards. The banks face growing regulatory burdens from the central banks, driving the cost of capital higher. Also, the lack of access to long-term finance, especially equity capital by SMEs is a huge roadblock.  Raising finance for women is even tougher in MENA region, as revealed by a survey done by IFC. 64 percent of the total women business owners tried to raise finance for their businesses and 41 percent overall faced hindrances in getting the required funds.  This brings up the need for Crowdfunding in the GCC states.

<strong>Figure 1 - Youth unemployment rates vs. the total unemployment rates in GCC, 2013
<img src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Crowdfunding-in-the-GCC-Fig1.jpg" alt="Youth unemployment rates vs. the total unemployment rates in GCC, 2013" /></strong>

KEY QUESTION 4: What are the various platforms available in GCC for crowd funding?

Some of the famous platforms present in the GCC currently are –
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
 	<li><strong>Zoomaal</strong> – It is an initiative by major Arab investors: Wamda (UAE), Middle East Venture Partners (MEVP, MENA), Hivos (Netherlands), Cairo Angels (Egypt), N2V (KSA), and Sawari Ventures (Egypt). It aims to support any creative project in need of funds in the Arab World. It generally works on the Reward Based and Donation based      Crowdfunding. The most famous success story of Zoomaal is the ‘THIS toothbrush’, made out of Miswak stem.</li>
</ol>
Figure 2- THIS toothbrush

<a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Crowdfunding-in-the-GCC-Fig2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Crowdfunding-in-the-GCC-Fig2.jpg" alt="This Toothbrush" /></a>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
 	<li><strong>Aflamnah</strong> – Means ‘our movies’ in Arabic. A cross between Kickstarter and Indiegogo, it concentrates on the Arab World productions. It was the first Crowdfunding initiative dedicated to creative ventures in the Arab World, operates on donation or rewards based Crowdfunding model. It aims ‘to help independent filmmakers, artists, geeks, students, innovators, thinkers and more to raise funds for their projects within 100 days by getting people excited enough to financially support their idea so that they can make it happen.’ One of the most famous success stories of Aflamnah is Mahmoud Kaabour’s ‘Champ of the Camp’ movie that won the esteemed award for Best Production of the Year at the Digital Studio Middle East Awards.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
 	<li value="2"><strong>Eureeca – </strong>Eureeca is based out of Dubai. It provides an online platform for SMEs to get funding for a large number of people. The SMEs provide equity in return for the funds, following an equity based Crowdfunding model. They concentrate on established growth firms that are looking for long-term funds for expansion. It has successfully funded the Arab Social network site – Weziwezi.com.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
 	<li value="3"><strong>MMKN – </strong>MMKN is a streamlined online platform introduced to inspire and fund the creative minds of the Middle East. They are into rewards based Crowdfunding. The company launched its beta version in July 2013.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
 	<li value="4"><strong>Shekra – </strong>Shekra aims to provide full support to startups, not just with the funding, but also with business plan formation, mentoring, post-funding monitoring, etc. It has a closed network of investors only who are privy to all project information. The investors are given a stake in return for their contribution. Instead of charging fees, Shekra’s compensation is through the equity stake in the start-ups, much similar to the Islamic principle of sharing risk. One of the success stories is Minbetna – an online supermarket.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
 	<li value="5"><strong>Durise – </strong>The real estate firm Durise launched its Crowdfunding concept in GCC region. It allows smaller investors to invest in the real-estate market with as little as USD 5000. They have different types of investment options with varied level of risk and return. Residential apartment in Dubai – Queue Point is currently live on their website for the investors to invest in, with a 24 months term period.</li>
</ol>
<strong>KEY QUESTION 5:  What are the challenges of crowd funding?</strong>

Few challenges include the vague regulations around Crowdfunding and skepticism in people related to new ideas and online investment. There is also a challenge of regulating foreign investments made through such sites. Eureeca allegedly allowed US nationals to purchase un-registered securities without taking sufficient steps to confirm if the purchasers were accredited under Rule 506(c) of the Securities Act.

<strong>LAST WORD:</strong> Despite the challenges, Crowdfunding has the potential to disrupt the conventional methods of fund-raising.[:]]]></Content>

		<Title>[:en]GCC: Smartphones storm stock market – Way To Go[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]If you want to trade stocks while on the move, look no further than your smartphone for help. Yes, thanks to the advent of mobile trading, you can buy and sell stocks with your smartphone, without being chained to your desktop or your laptop.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Nowadays, many brokerage firms offer mobile share trading service as a significant value addition to the client. Online stock trading removes the middleman and helps you to actively manage your portfolio. This means you have full control by making the stock deals all by yourself!<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Mobile trading is just not another mode to do online trading; it offers several additional advantages. You can track share transactions whether you are at home or in the office. You don&#39;t have to call anyone to place an order. Instead, you can do everything with a few taps on the phone. Further, there are several Apps that present analysis in the form of charts, statistics, and market news, with which you can take informed decisions. You can do your investments anytime, anywhere with your smartphone.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
A little bit of history is in order. Online trading developed slowly: crippled by the stock crash of 1987, plus the recession that followed and the Gulf War. It picked momentum in the 1990s, primarily because of the ease with which it could be operated and the sharp reduction in brokerage fees. Small wonder, the number of online brokerage firms in the US, the mother of equity markets, jumped from 12 in 1994 to 140 by the year 2000. The growth became exponential once mobile phones and tablets arrived. This trend is expected to accelerate everywhere in the future.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Mobile marries Market </strong><br />
The world of capital markets has been expanding, with proliferation in the number of investors and traders. Once a playground for the wealthy, the market is now accessible to the masses, courtesy technological advancement. In this regard, mobile trading is an emerging trend and clearly the rising star.<br />

Mobile phones are no longer meant only to make calls or text. Now they are also used to trade. The statistics speak for themselves. In 2013, 72% of active stock players in the UK used a smartphone or tablet to make equity purchases and sales. Almost 90% of the current traders use a mobile device to monitor their positions. More than seven out of ten close their positions on a smartphone or tablet. Little wonder, brokerage firms are bending backwards to provide clients with top-notch Apps and are pouring money to develop and enhance their mobile capabilities.<br />

<strong>HNIs&rsquo; use of Mobile Devices for Financial Management</strong><br />
<img alt="GCC-Smartphones-stock-market.jpg" class="researchDemand" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GCC-Smartphones-stock-market.jpg" style="width: 601px; height: 186px;" title="GCC-Smartphones-stock-market.jpg" /><br />
<br />
A study suggested that 42% of the High Net-worth Individuals in the world use tablets and 26% of them use smartphones for conducting to do mobile trading. A larger percentage uses it to access account information and conduct investment research. This is not surprising. After all, with these Apps you can even trade virtual portfolios, draw on stock charts, get real-time streaming price and economic data, and chart FRED [Federal Reserve Economic Data] data series.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
There is a reason why mobile trading hasn&#39;t caught fire in the GCC region. Users are worried about uncertainty arising from data input errors, software failures, connection loss, and privacy loss. Given increasing reports of mobile Internet hacking, users fear that an unauthorized party will gain access to their financial accounts.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The Mobile has changed the way people communicate and conduct business. In recent years, GCC countries have seen a tremendous rise in the penetration of smartphones. In UAE, for example, smartphone penetration has increased to 74% of the population. 56% of them access the Internet every day on their smartphone and most never leave home without it. Such has been the monumental impact of this gadget in the lives of ordinary people.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Let&rsquo;s look at some numbers for further proof. In 2013, the number of mobile connections in the GCC was 1.7 times the total population of these countries.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s almost like one person having two smart phones! &nbsp;This penetration is among the highest in the world, surpassing even developed countries like the USA. Also the number of 3G connections in these countries, which allow usage of high-speed Internet, is on par with developed nations. Table 1 provides the details.<br />

		<Title>[:en]Smart Cities in the GCC[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<h3><span style="color:#000000;">An Emerging Trend</span></h3>
<span style="color:#000000;">Smart City is a hot and happening concept in the field of urban innovation right now. This concept assumes that a city operates as a system or a group of interlocked parts working together, where technology is used to maximize its efficiency and also unlock its potential, while its chief focus remaining on sustainability.<br />
<br />
<strong>What makes cities smart?</strong><br />
<img alt="What-makes-GCC-Cities-smart.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Smart-Cities-in-the-GCC.jpg" style="width: 634px; height: 212px;" title="What-makes-GCC-Cities-smart.jpg" /><br />
<br />
There have been different perspectives about how a smart city should be or what it should have; however there has been no single definition to what makes a city smart. In terms of infrastructure, it focuses around citizen-centric services, the expansion and enhancement of transportation networks, the management of public safety, waste and energy resources, and education and health services. Economic development, tourism promotion, and job creation are also important aspects to be considered.<br />
<br />
Technology advancements in the last decade have created the right environment for Smart City solutions. Pervasive wireless and broadband connections, advanced analytics software, intelligent sensors, the profusion of mobile devices, and the use of social media can all be integrated by vendors to provide solutions for city governments.<br />
<br />
<b>Global Trends </b><br />
<br />
It is estimated that the smart city market worldwide would be valued at 400 billion USD by 2020 . As it is projected that around 60% of the global population will be in urban locations by 2025, the concept of Smart Cities has started earning acceptance among policy makers.<br />
<br />
Urbanization as a trend will have diverging impacts and influences on future personal lives and mobility. Rapid expansion of city borders, driven by increase in population and infrastructure development, would force city borders to expand outward and engulf the surrounding daughter cities to form mega cities, each with a population of more than 10 million. By 2023, there will be 30 mega cities globally, with 55 percent in developing economies of India, China, Russia and Latin America. The mega cities from emerging economies will witness a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 4.4 percent in GDP (PPP) from 2009 to 2025, as compared to a CAGR of 1.63 percent for the same period in the mega cities from developed economies.<br />
<br />
The explosive population growth and dynamic shift in urban sprawl, coupled with the economic growth of mega cities in the emerging economies, will pose a variety of opportunities for companies operating in different sectors. The mega cities from the emerging economies will become the largest markets for existing premium products and technologies, while their developed counterparts will witness a trend of sustainable measures. This will also lead to the evolution of smart cities with eight smart features, including Smart Economy, Smart Buildings, Smart Mobility, Smart Energy, Smart Information Communication and Technology, Smart Planning, Smart Citizen and Smart Governance. There will be about 40 smart cities globally by 2025.<br />
<br />
<b>Smart Technologies</b><br />
<br />
Many international firms like IBM, Cisco and Hitachi have been developing innovative solutions for implementing technology in various fields like energy management, water management and much more..<br />
<br />
<b>Intelligent water system Concept</b><br />
<br />
In an intelligent water system, treated wastewater that would have been discarded previously is aggressively utilized in residential and industrial areas as recycled water. In addition, the operational data from each water treatment plant is managed centrally as water infrastructure information, thereby enabling efficient operation of each facility. These systems along with various other similar systems can be used in combination in order to provide a solution that can resolve the water shortage problem.<br />
<br />
<b>Smart Grid</b><br />
<br />
Electricity generated in power stations reaches us through the power grid. As there has been progress in deploying Renewable energy controlled by the weather, such as wind and solar power generation, it is expected that there will be growth in power demand for applications such as the widespread use of electric vehicles. With a Smart Grid, these sources and demands can be controlled by information technology, enabling us to make deft use of natural energy alongside nuclear power and other conventional power sources, which will help to reduce CO2 emissions.<br />
<br />
<b>Smart Mobility</b><br />
<br />
Smart Mobility involves the integration of transportation services along with the implementation of IT services to provide an easier and more efficient way of commuting within the city. With the help of navigation services, the traffic is monitored and the best mode of transport is suggested to the user after simulating the time of travel for each mode. This saves time for the user and enables an energy efficient management of public transport.<br />
<br />
<b>Smart Cities in the GCC</b><br />
<br />
In the GCC, the trend of linking smart cities to the agenda of economic diversification is fast gaining ground. Initiatives have been taken in the GCC region, with three countries announcing projects for future Smart Cities: six greenfield economic cities in Saudi Arabia (complemented by efforts to uplift cities such as Mecca toward Smart City status); three projects in Qatar (Lusail&rsquo;s Smart and Sustainable City, Pearl-Qatar Island, and Energy City Qatar); and two projects in the UAE (Masdar City in Abu Dhabi and Smart City Dubai).<br />
There have been heavy investments across the GCC countries towards smart city projects. According to Cisco, Saudi Arabia has invested USD 70 billion to build four new Smart Cities in a collaborative partnership between the KSA and the Cisco. Spending on IT products and services alone in the Middle East will increase 7.3% year on year in 2014 to top USD 32 billion . IDC expects the total spending on machine-to-machine (M2M) connections in the GCC countries to increase 19% year on year in 2014 to reach $224 million.<br />
<br />
<b>Dubai Smart City</b><br />
<br />
The strategy features six key pillars and 100 initiatives on transport, communications, infrastructure, electricity, economic services, urban planning. Under the strategy, 1000 government services will go smart in the next three years. The strategic plan is based on three basic ideas namely communication, integration and cooperation. These ideas will enhance communication between the residents of the city and its institutions. They also facilities easy access and sharing of data about the city to keep them informed about government entities, schools, hospitals, roads and transport, sensor systems, buildings, energy and others.<br />
<br />
As part of the Dubai Smart strategy, Roads and Transport Authority will implement a comprehensive plan to ensure access to provide the smart transportation by creation of a &lsquo;unified control center&rsquo; for all means of transportation, as well as providing more than 200 services, using smartphones at the end of 2015, in addition to RTA&rsquo;s current services.<br />
<br />
With regard to the energy sector, a number of initiatives including the development of &lsquo;smart electrical grid&rsquo; to encourage owners of houses and buildings in Dubai to use solar energy and sell the surplus to the government through the network itself , as well as &quot; smart meters &quot; that contribute to rationalizing the consumption of electricity and water are being developed. Dubai Municipality (DM) is working on the implementation of smart parks and beaches projects that provide specific information on weather conditions, sea, temperatures and safety guidelines, as well as the launch of &lsquo;I-Dubai&rsquo;, which provides information relating to the services of the municipality.<br />
<br />
<b>Mecca Smart City</b><br />
<br />
Mecca, one of Islam&#39;s holiest cities, is being turned into a smart city through a massive upgrading exercise carried out by the Saudi Arabian government since the end of last year&#39;s Haj season. The plan that includes housing, transportation, shopping and historical sites will ensure that Muslims from all over the world can have a safe and nice journey when they perform Haj or Umrah in this holy city.<br />
<br />
Two mega projects for road construction and public transportation network are being undertaken for the city as a whole, besides special projects such as the expansion of the Masjidil Haram (Grand Mosque). Certain parts of the great mosque have been under expansion since last year. It can now accommodate 400,000 people for prayers during this Ramadan. The three-year expansion work started just after Haj in mid-November last year. When the whole expansion project is completed, the capacity will be for more than 1.5 million people up to a total of almost two million.<br />
<br />
<b>Lusail Smart City</b><br />
<br />
The Lusail Smart City positions itself as one of Qatar&rsquo;s most advanced cities. Lusail will provide a switched on, high-technology environment comprising both wired and wireless communication networks to offer advanced services.<br />
<br />
An operation control centre, based in Lusail City will be responsible for implementing and managing the strategic information technology network covering the city&rsquo;s entire systems and activities, handling the surveillance systems in and around the city and also maintaining the security of buildings, facilities and streets. Lusail Smart City also offers various telecommunication services for the benefit of citizens and also to encourage business.<br />
<br />
<b>Emerging Technology trends in GCC Smart Cities</b><br />
<br />
Governments have been investing in technology to provide innovative solutions for a variety of domains. Most of them are centered on devices like smartphones and tablets. Nearly 75% of people in the UAE own a smartphone. Data from Google suggested that this was the highest level of smartphone penetration in the world, just ahead of South Korea. Saudi Arabia came third, with 72.8% of KSA&rsquo;s population owning a smartphone.<br />
<br />
Dubai government presented its vision for the smart city where government services are to be provided seamlessly to the citizens through technology. It included aspects like citizens wearing smart wrist band to communicate with the government and parents receiving updates on their children&rsquo;s school results via a digital box at the breakfast table. The smart wrist band would also have several functions where users can use it as a digital passport, digital car key etc. The future of Dubai Smart City will be based on technology to make living more comfortable.<br />
<br />
Works have also been going on to implement technology in various day to day services. UAE proposes drones to deliver ID cards and driving licenses. This is a measure taken to save time, increase effectiveness and to make services easier. Ambulances in Qatar could be able to control traffic lights using new technology which will enable emergency vehicles to transmit a signal to change the traffic lights ahead of them. This move could potentially reduce life threatening delays. Google Street View-cars are coming to the Middle East, with Dubai being the first city in the region to have street views added to Google&rsquo;s online mapping service.<br />
<br />
GCC countries are also planning to implement waste containers that are able to communicate with trash disposal services when overflowing, including sending a tweet message. Overflow of waste in trash can has been a constant nuisance for city sanitation departments, landlords and private waste management companies. By monitoring waste containers with smart wireless sensors, collection of garbage can be scheduled and the process can be made more efficient.<br />
<br />
Therefore with the rapid advancements in technology and the commitment of GCC governments towards, we may soon be seeing several smart cities in the GCC creating benchmarks for the cities worldwide.</span>[:]]]></Content>

Globally, the assets under Islamic finance industry have surpassed the USD 2.4tn mark. Digitalization which has emerged as a revolutionary trend in financial system is becoming popular in Islamic finance industry as well. Islamic banks account for over 70% of industry’s total assets, as of latest available. Islamic liquidity management instruments are still at their infancy, and there are very few instruments that meets the industry needs and investors’ expectations at the same time.

The main challenge in Islamic finance industry lies in the process of providing liquidity management tools that can compete with conventional ones. Unlike conventional institutions, the dearth of liquidity in Islamic finance industry due to lack of tradeable instruments as Shariah restrictions limits the range of instruments that can be used for liquidity management. Islamic interbank and money markets also lack the magnitude of volume and diversification as seen in conventional markets.

However, over the years there has been improvement in liquidity in secondary market trading helped by global Islamic players such as HSBC Amanah, CIMB Islamic (Malaysia) and Dubai Islamic Bank that have been actively involved in the trading of sukuk papers in the secondary market. Dubai and Malaysian market are among the most popular stock markets that have seen high growth in liquidity. It is important to note that in Nov-2006, Dubai stock exchange announced its restructuring plans to become the world’s first Islamic bourse.

A variety of approaches have been adopted in different jurisdictions and much work has been done to diversify the mix of available options for Islamic banks to manage their short to medium-term liquidity. Organizations providing Shariah standards such as Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI) and the Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB) established in 1991 and 2002 respectively are playing an important role in bridging this gap.

More strategies that suits the liquidity management and personal financing needs of Islamic finance industry continue to be developed. One such product is National Bonds’ Sukuk Trading Platform that simultaneously addresses the operational requirements of Islamic banks and their customers and external stakeholders’ preferences. In liquidity management, it has the potential to be both flexible and authentic, offering an investment destination to park the surplus funds or an investment tool/model which financial institutions and central banks can utilize for providing liquidity to banks when needed.

Islamic banks will continue to shift towards Islamic liquidity management instruments that increase their ability to place more of their surplus liquidity with other banks or with the central bank. Liquidity management however continues to remain at the core of the issues that regulators need to address to ensure the healthy growth and development of the Islamic banking sector.

Since the financial crisis, new regulatory requirements under Basel III have increased requirement by banks to hold sufficient high-quality liquid assets. To overcome liquidity management issues, the International Islamic Liquidity Management Corporation (IILM) was established in 2010. Following its establishment, it marked another milestone with the issuance of US Dollar denominated rated tradable Sukuk in Aug-2013. These instruments have contributed in enhancing the cross-border flows, strengthening the international linkages and promoting financial stability.

In Feb-2009, Indonesia became the first nation to sell retail sharia-compliant bonds targeting retail investors. Since then Malaysia and Pakistan have also issued retail focused sukuk and most recently Saudi Arabia is also looking to open up Islamic bond market to retail investors. The appeal of sharia-compliant financial products has since broadened with the creation of a more active investor base and increasing number of organizations considering sukuk market as an alternative for raising funds.

More recently, there has been a spur in the launch of digital only Islamic banks. Several governments with large Islamic financial systems including UAE and Bahrain are encouraging Fintech through creation of regulatory sandboxes. Shariah scholars are also evaluating the extent of Shariah compliance of latest innovations such as cryptocurrencies and actively helping Fintech firms to develop Shariah compliant products.

According to Reuters estimates, Islamic finance industry that currently comprise of nearly 1,400 institutions globally, has a potential to reach close to USD 3.8tn by 2023. Adoption of latest technology will play a significant role in this regard.[:ar]This article was first published in Islamic Finance news dated December 2019.

Globally, the assets under Islamic finance industry have surpassed the USD 2.4tn mark. Digitalization which has emerged as a revolutionary trend in financial system is becoming popular in Islamic finance industry as well. Islamic banks account for over 70% of industry’s total assets, as of latest available. Islamic liquidity management instruments are still at their infancy, and there are very few instruments that meets the industry needs and investors’ expectations at the same time.

		<Title>[:en]Status of Tax Regime in GCC[:ar]وضع النظام الضريبي في دول مجلس التعاون الخليجي[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<strong>GCC Taxation –</strong><strong>History and Perspectives</strong>
The GCC region is known for its low tax regime. The issue of taxation in the GCC has been discussed since the 1980s and has seen many changes in the years. The tax rates and tax structures vary among the GCC countries. Kuwait introduced a corporate tax in 1955. Saudi Arabia had an income tax on foreigners until 1975, after which it was suspended owing to increasing revenue from oil exports and the need to attract expatriates to work in the Kingdom.

Countries in the GCC, apparently, have somewhat similar histories with respect to introduction of various taxes during the period post-1980. There has been opposition from various groups for the introduction of such taxes. For instance, in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain there were instant opposition to the proposal for introduction of income tax.  Moreover, the region still does not have any personal taxes but they have corporate taxes which were introduced over the years.

In the early 1990s, many GCC countries studied the feasibility of introducing VAT and corporate tax as part of their economic reforms. Organizations like IMF and World Bank have stressed the importance for taxation as a form of supporting economic diversification. Effective taxation regimes require robust institutions and mechanisms to be in place for efficient tax collection and utilization.

<strong>Why GCC countries need to impose personal taxes?</strong>

The economy of the GCC countries is mainly dependent on oil exports for the government revenue. Historically when oil prices have fallen, as during the gulf war, these countries have had difficulty in meeting their expenses as their revenues reduced.

With oil prices entering a period of sustained volatility and downward pressures, it is likely that the oil-based GDPs are likely to suffer. With a growing population and the need to create employment, there is the need to consider personal taxes as a measure to replenish government coffers that can, in turn, fund projects that are of value to the citizens. Bodies like the IMF have repeatedly urged many GCC nations to bolster economic diversification efforts in order to create sustainable revenue streams.

In fact, the IMF has recommended that they cut spending and implement income tax, corporate tax, consumption tax and value added tax. Also, the IMF has encouraged the introduction of indirect and direct taxation in countries where they were previously either minimal or absent altogether, expansion of taxation schemes in countries where they were already present, and an effort to use existing schemes as an inducement to encourage regional taxation schemes. Additional factors for GCC countries in considering the introduction of new taxation stem from their economies’ increasing exposure to global trade. These include the growing numbers of bilateral and/or regional Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) concluded in recent years such as the Bahrain-US or GCC-Singapore FTA, or the Oman-US FTA that is under consideration.

<strong>Saudi Arabia</strong>

Saudi Arabia had an income tax on expatriates until 1975, after which it was suspended in line with expanding oil revenues. In 2004, Saudi Arabia cut its corporate taxes from 30% to 20% to attract foreign investors. The Kingdom is in the process of introducing many changes in its taxation policies and is attempting to do that on a consensual basis.

<strong>Kuwait </strong>

Kuwait introduced corporate tax in 1955. In 2000, IMF noted that Kuwait had taken efforts to reform its corporate tax law, broad based consumption tax and the levying of excises on luxury items. In 2007, the Kuwaiti government reduced the corporate tax of 1955 from 55% to 15% as they felt it hindered the flow of foreign investments into Kuwait. Since 2013, there has been persistent speculation that Kuwait is considering a VAT regime. However, nothing official has been announced so far.

<strong>Bahrain</strong>

Like many other GCC countries, no form of personal, corporate, withholding or VAT is applicable in Bahrain. However, there is the municipal tax of 10% on the monthly rental of residential and business real estate. In addition, a 5% levy on gross turnover is imposed on the hotel services industry and entertainment. In October 2009, the Bahrain parliamentary chairman proposed placing a tax on foreign investors setting up large-scale projects. However, the parliamentary committee amended the proposal to include Bahraini and GCC investors to avoid contravening World Trade Organization regulations. Given that Bahrain’s hydrocarbons base is not as robust as most other GCC peers, the country is expected to device a strategic taxation regime sooner rather than later.

<strong>Qatar</strong>

Since the closing stages of the previous century, Qatar has been looking at taxation as a tool for supplementing State revenues beyond just the prodigious hydrocarbon revenues. In 2008, the corporate taxes were reduced from 35% to 10%, in line with the prevailing trend in the region during that period.
The tax regime in Qatar is territorial in nature. I.e., taxes are levied only on income generated fully or partially in the sea and soil of the State of Qatar. Income generated by Qataris or Qatari entities outside Qatar is not subject to any taxes. Also, there are two streams of taxes in Qatar – corporate tax and withholding tax.

<strong>Oman</strong>

Oman introduced corporate tax in 1994. In 2000, it announced tax reductions for foreign investors to attract foreign investments. In 2001, IMF in its report recommended Oman to introduce excise taxes on luxury goods and services, and a simple property tax to replace the taxation of rental agreements in the short run. To offset falling oil revenues, in 2003 Oman imposed a road tax and raised petrol prices. Oman also came out with the executive regulations for the Income Tax law in 2012 with the introduction of 18 new tax forms. The laws were approved by the government and were implemented in 2013.

<strong>United Arab Emirates</strong>

UAE had plans to introduce income tax in 1988, but they did not materialize due to several hurdles. Within the UAE itself, Dubai has pulled ahead of the rest of the country in terms of strategizing over tax regimes.  The structural differences within the UAE in terms of how the various polities are arranged means that different Emirates enjoy autonomy with respect to their own policies’ framework.  In 2009, UAE proposed a 2-5% VAT on goods and services that has however not seen any follow-up implementation, as of yet.  The UAE is expected to adopt a patient approach of learning lessons from potential future VAT implementation experiences and then carry them over to the personal taxation space, expected still later.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>
The GCC nations have felt the necessity of taxes in order to strengthen their economy and reduce their dependence on the oil exports. These countries have faced hurdles in the implementation of taxes. There has been proposals from the various GCC governments to introduce a unified VAT across the region and 2015 was set as the tentative target for its introduction. Any VAT regime, if introduced, is expected to be around 5-10% in the GCC countries. The personal taxes are not expected to be implemented in the near future. These countries will first have to successfully implement the VAT and develop collection systems that are efficient. There are reports that collection systems are being explored in the UAE and Bahrain, which can be studied and by other GCC countries as part of analysis on the topic.

The distribution of the tax revenue forms an important aspect of taxation policy. The taxation policy should benefit the country and the society as a whole without undue pressure on those who experience only low income levels. There will also be the growing requirement for standardization and harmonization of taxation policies and regimes across the GCC in order to foster a more business friendly environment and for boosting intra-GCC trade. Such a move could also alleviate the need for the GCC nations to compete among themselves in terms of taxation thresholds as a form of incentive for FDI.  Most importantly, for the various GCC authorities, a steady inflow of coordinated taxation revenues into the States’ coffers can provide strong buffers against oil price volatility in the international markets, something that entered pronounced territory in the second half of 2014.[:ar]<strong>GCC Taxation –</strong><strong>History and Perspectives</strong>
The GCC region is known for its low tax regime. The issue of taxation in the GCC has been discussed since the 1980s and has seen many changes in the years. The tax rates and tax structures vary among the GCC countries. Kuwait introduced a corporate tax in 1955. Saudi Arabia had an income tax on foreigners until 1975, after which it was suspended owing to increasing revenue from oil exports and the need to attract expatriates to work in the Kingdom.

Countries in the GCC, apparently, have somewhat similar histories with respect to introduction of various taxes during the period post-1980. There has been opposition from various groups for the introduction of such taxes. For instance, in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain there were instant opposition to the proposal for introduction of income tax.  Moreover, the region still does not have any personal taxes but they have corporate taxes which were introduced over the years.

In the early 1990s, many GCC countries studied the feasibility of introducing VAT and corporate tax as part of their economic reforms. Organizations like IMF and World Bank have stressed the importance for taxation as a form of supporting economic diversification. Effective taxation regimes require robust institutions and mechanisms to be in place for efficient tax collection and utilization.

<strong>Why GCC countries need to impose personal taxes?</strong>

The economy of the GCC countries is mainly dependent on oil exports for the government revenue. Historically when oil prices have fallen, as during the gulf war, these countries have had difficulty in meeting their expenses as their revenues reduced.

With oil prices entering a period of sustained volatility and downward pressures, it is likely that the oil-based GDPs are likely to suffer. With a growing population and the need to create employment, there is the need to consider personal taxes as a measure to replenish government coffers that can, in turn, fund projects that are of value to the citizens. Bodies like the IMF have repeatedly urged many GCC nations to bolster economic diversification efforts in order to create sustainable revenue streams.

In fact, the IMF has recommended that they cut spending and implement income tax, corporate tax, consumption tax and value added tax. Also, the IMF has encouraged the introduction of indirect and direct taxation in countries where they were previously either minimal or absent altogether, expansion of taxation schemes in countries where they were already present, and an effort to use existing schemes as an inducement to encourage regional taxation schemes. Additional factors for GCC countries in considering the introduction of new taxation stem from their economies’ increasing exposure to global trade. These include the growing numbers of bilateral and/or regional Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) concluded in recent years such as the Bahrain-US or GCC-Singapore FTA, or the Oman-US FTA that is under consideration.

<strong>Country Specific Taxes</strong>

<strong>Saudi Arabia</strong>

Saudi Arabia had an income tax on expatriates until 1975, after which it was suspended in line with expanding oil revenues. In 2004, Saudi Arabia cut its corporate taxes from 30% to 20% to attract foreign investors. The Kingdom is in the process of introducing many changes in its taxation policies and is attempting to do that on a consensual basis.

<strong>Kuwait </strong>

Kuwait introduced corporate tax in 1955. In 2000, IMF noted that Kuwait had taken efforts to reform its corporate tax law, broad based consumption tax and the levying of excises on luxury items. In 2007, the Kuwaiti government reduced the corporate tax of 1955 from 55% to 15% as they felt it hindered the flow of foreign investments into Kuwait. Since 2013, there has been persistent speculation that Kuwait is considering a VAT regime. However, nothing official has been announced so far.

<strong>Bahrain</strong>

Like many other GCC countries, no form of personal, corporate, withholding or VAT is applicable in Bahrain. However, there is the municipal tax of 10% on the monthly rental of residential and business real estate. In addition, a 5% levy on gross turnover is imposed on the hotel services industry and entertainment. In October 2009, the Bahrain parliamentary chairman proposed placing a tax on foreign investors setting up large-scale projects. However, the parliamentary committee amended the proposal to include Bahraini and GCC investors to avoid contravening World Trade Organization regulations. Given that Bahrain’s hydrocarbons base is not as robust as most other GCC peers, the country is expected to device a strategic taxation regime sooner rather than later.

<strong>Qatar</strong>

Since the closing stages of the previous century, Qatar has been looking at taxation as a tool for supplementing State revenues beyond just the prodigious hydrocarbon revenues. In 2008, the corporate taxes were reduced from 35% to 10%, in line with the prevailing trend in the region during that period.
The tax regime in Qatar is territorial in nature. I.e., taxes are levied only on income generated fully or partially in the sea and soil of the State of Qatar. Income generated by Qataris or Qatari entities outside Qatar is not subject to any taxes. Also, there are two streams of taxes in Qatar – corporate tax and withholding tax.

<strong>Oman</strong>

Oman introduced corporate tax in 1994. In 2000, it announced tax reductions for foreign investors to attract foreign investments. In 2001, IMF in its report recommended Oman to introduce excise taxes on luxury goods and services, and a simple property tax to replace the taxation of rental agreements in the short run. To offset falling oil revenues, in 2003 Oman imposed a road tax and raised petrol prices. Oman also came out with the executive regulations for the Income Tax law in 2012 with the introduction of 18 new tax forms. The laws were approved by the government and were implemented in 2013.

<strong>United Arab Emirates</strong>

UAE had plans to introduce income tax in 1988, but they did not materialize due to several hurdles. Within the UAE itself, Dubai has pulled ahead of the rest of the country in terms of strategizing over tax regimes.  The structural differences within the UAE in terms of how the various polities are arranged means that different Emirates enjoy autonomy with respect to their own policies’ framework.  In 2009, UAE proposed a 2-5% VAT on goods and services that has however not seen any follow-up implementation, as of yet.  The UAE is expected to adopt a patient approach of learning lessons from potential future VAT implementation experiences and then carry them over to the personal taxation space, expected still later.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>
The GCC nations have felt the necessity of taxes in order to strengthen their economy and reduce their dependence on the oil exports. These countries have faced hurdles in the implementation of taxes. There has been proposals from the various GCC governments to introduce a unified VAT across the region and 2015 was set as the tentative target for its introduction. Any VAT regime, if introduced, is expected to be around 5-10% in the GCC countries. The personal taxes are not expected to be implemented in the near future. These countries will first have to successfully implement the VAT and develop collection systems that are efficient. There are reports that collection systems are being explored in the UAE and Bahrain, which can be studied and by other GCC countries as part of analysis on the topic.

The distribution of the tax revenue forms an important aspect of taxation policy. The taxation policy should benefit the country and the society as a whole without undue pressure on those who experience only low income levels. There will also be the growing requirement for standardization and harmonization of taxation policies and regimes across the GCC in order to foster a more business friendly environment and for boosting intra-GCC trade. Such a move could also alleviate the need for the GCC nations to compete among themselves in terms of taxation thresholds as a form of incentive for FDI.  Most importantly, for the various GCC authorities, a steady inflow of coordinated taxation revenues into the States’ coffers can provide strong buffers against oil price volatility in the international markets, something that entered pronounced territory in the second half of 2014.[:]]]></Content>

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]Regulations and regulatory reforms are in vogue these days. The GCC has been witnessing a swathe of regulatory reforms in various sectors. How important is it to calibrate and balance reforms and regulations? This question has become hugely important in this setting.

Broadly speaking, regulations have the following characteristics:
1. <strong>Counter-cyclical nature:</strong> We see that policy makers wake up only when there is a disaster in the making! The global financial crisis of 2008 is a great example, post which, a wave of regulations evolved that was mainly aimed at the financial sector. We hardly see regulators active when the going is good. This is actually counter intuitive. Strong regulations should be introduced when the going is good, so that the stakeholders have the energy and the time to pursue them effectively. Locking the stable after the horses have bolted away does not make good sense!

2. <strong>Market Maturity:</strong> Regulations can be illustrated as distillations of wisdom gained from ongoing market experiments. Markets evolve over a period of time through multiple experiences and regulations are nothing but an accumulation of such experiences. The troughs and peaks as the markets waltz through time enable regulators to absorb lessons and implement relevant checks and balances as part of the continuous movement towards greater perfection. In that sense, regulations are milestones that indicate the levels of market maturity.

3. <strong>Investor Confidence:</strong> Properly introduced regulations and reforms can go much towards enhancing investor confidence. Lack of investor confidence primarily stems from a poor regulatory architecture. A case in point is the emerging and frontier markets, which in spite of its attractiveness, nevertheless suffers from poor investor confidence (especially foreign investors).

4. <strong>Ease of Doing Business:</strong> Regulations can go a long way in easing the way business is conducted. If enacted poorly, regulations can also contribute to the opposite. It is generally considered a best practice to measure the effectiveness and success of a particular regulation based on how well it facilitates ease of doing business. Ease of doing business is generally talked about in the context of foreign investors. I feel it does apply in equal measure to local businessmen.

5. <strong>Global Perception and Brand Building:</strong> Regulations can also contribute to enhanced and improved global perception about a particular market. Preservation of investor rights, intellectual property, speed of legal trials, can be cited as some examples that lead to the strengthening of a particular location or city as a brand (e.g.,Singapore). Major decisions, including setting up of manufacturing units, are critically based on the strength of global perceptions.

In the context of the aforementioned characteristics or essential features of regulations, it is worth mapping the framework to the GCC environment. The below chart illustrates the number of reforms, sector wise in the GCC, since 2008. It is interesting to note that foreign investment is an area where there have been only subdued regulatory movements; while Banking and Financial Services has witnessed intense regulatory pronouncements. There can be reasons for this. Attracting inward foreign capital may not be an immediate priority for liquidity rich GCC states. However, FDI is just not about attracting capital, only. Foreign investment can also enhance the talent pool in the region, bring new technologies, and above all, improve investor confidence and upgrade global perception. On the contrary, Banking and Financial Services is a dominant and highly mature sector contributing to over 50% of the market capitalization in the respective stock markets of the GCC countries. In the absence of an active debt market and due to a paucity of long-term funding instruments, banks end up being the primary mover of the financial wheel. This explains the “over regulated” nature of this sector.

<img class="researchDemand" style="width: 600px; height: 354px;" title="Calibrating-Regulations-Indicative-Number-of-Reforms-GCC.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Calibrating-Regulations-Fig1.jpg" alt="Calibrating-Regulations-Indicative-Number-of-Reforms-GCC.jpg" />

So, what then makes regulations effective?
<strong>1. Balance:</strong> Under regulation may inhibit the growth of a sector; while excessive regulations may increase the cost of doing business. Hence, the need to balance regulations carefully.

<strong>2. Oversight:</strong> Declaring a regulation is only the opening gambit, while the real challenge lies in the implementation on the ground. A case in point are the Capital Market Authorities across many GCC countries. While CMAs’ require a spate of documentation to be submitted by the companies, they may not have the commensurate infrastructure or technology to monitor all the submissions and take action where necessary.

<strong>3. KPI's:</strong> Regulations become effective only when regulators don’t limit their role to just policing and fining. The agenda of regulators should be more broad based and should include the development and growth of the sectors that they are regulating. If after a decade of regulations, a sector has failed to demonstrate growth and development, then the regulators should also share the blame!

<strong>4. Cost:</strong> Mindless regulations should be avoided as compliance cost is an important component with respect to economic efficiency. This is particularly true of “imported regulations”, which under the name of best practices, are whisked in with little consideration given to their applicability vis-à-vis local realities.

In summary, it can be said that there can be no doubt about the integral and important role that effective regulations have. The role that they play in the organized development of a market cannot be understated or deemphasized. However, calibrating regulations and achieving a fit balance is the need of the hour.[:ar]Regulations and regulatory reforms are in vogue these days.

Locking the stable after the horses have bolted away does not make good sense!

2. <strong>Market Maturity:</strong> Regulations can be illustrated as distillations of wisdom gained from ongoing market experiments. Markets evolve over a period of time through multiple experiences and regulations are nothing but an accumulation of such experiences. The troughs and peaks as the markets waltz through time enable regulators to absorb lessons and implement relevant checks and balances as part of the continuous movement towards greater perfection. In that sense, regulations are milestones that indicate the levels of market maturity.

3. <strong>Investor Confidence:</strong> Properly introduced regulations and reforms can go much towards enhancing investor confidence. Lack of investor confidence primarily stems from a poor regulatory architecture. A case in point is the emerging and frontier markets, which in spite of its attractiveness, nevertheless suffers from poor investor confidence (especially foreign investors).

4. <strong>Ease of Doing Business:</strong> Regulations can go a long way in easing the way business is conducted. If enacted poorly, regulations can also contribute to the opposite. It is generally considered a best practice to measure the effectiveness and success of a particular regulation based on how well it facilitates ease of doing business. Ease of doing business is generally talked about in the context of foreign investors. I feel it does apply in equal measure to local businessmen.

5. <strong>Global Perception and Brand Building:</strong> Regulations can also contribute to enhanced and improved global perception about a particular market. Preservation of investor rights, intellectual property, speed of legal trials, can be cited as some examples that lead to the strengthening of a particular location or city as a brand (e.g.,Singapore). Major decisions, including setting up of manufacturing units, are critically based on the strength of global perceptions.

In the context of the aforementioned characteristics or essential features of regulations, it is worth mapping the framework to the GCC environment. The below chart illustrates the number of reforms, sector wise in the GCC, since 2008. It is interesting to note that foreign investment is an area where there have been only subdued regulatory movements; while Banking and Financial Services has witnessed intense regulatory pronouncements. There can be reasons for this. Attracting inward foreign capital may not be an immediate priority for liquidity rich GCC states. However, FDI is just not about attracting capital, only. Foreign investment can also enhance the talent pool in the region, bring new technologies, and above all, improve investor confidence and upgrade global perception. On the contrary, Banking and Financial Services is a dominant and highly mature sector contributing to over 50% of the market capitalization in the respective stock markets of the GCC countries. In the absence of an active debt market and due to a paucity of long-term funding instruments, banks end up being the primary mover of the financial wheel. This explains the “over regulated” nature of this sector.

<img class="researchDemand" style="width: 600px; height: 354px;" title="Calibrating-Regulations-Indicative-Number-of-Reforms-GCC.jpg" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Calibrating-Regulations-Fig1.jpg" alt="Calibrating-Regulations-Indicative-Number-of-Reforms-GCC.jpg" />

So, what then makes regulations effective?
<strong>1. Balance:</strong> Under regulation may inhibit the growth of a sector; while excessive regulations may increase the cost of doing business. Hence, the need to balance regulations carefully.

<strong>2. Oversight:</strong> Declaring a regulation is only the opening gambit, while the real challenge lies in the implementation on the ground. A case in point are the Capital Market Authorities across many GCC countries. While CMAs’ require a spate of documentation to be submitted by the companies, they may not have the commensurate infrastructure or technology to monitor all the submissions and take action where necessary.

<strong>3. KPI's:</strong> Regulations become effective only when regulators don’t limit their role to just policing and fining. The agenda of regulators should be more broad based and should include the development and growth of the sectors that they are regulating. If after a decade of regulations, a sector has failed to demonstrate growth and development, then the regulators should also share the blame!

<strong>4. Cost:</strong> Mindless regulations should be avoided as compliance cost is an important component with respect to economic efficiency. This is particularly true of “imported regulations”, which under the name of best practices, are whisked in with little consideration given to their applicability vis-à-vis local realities.

In summary, it can be said that there can be no doubt about the integral and important role that effective regulations have. The role that they play in the organized development of a market cannot be understated or deemphasized. However, calibrating regulations and achieving a fit balance is the need of the hour.[:]]]></Content>

A scan of the above list will tell us that the focus of Kuwait has been to improve business governance within the country and strengthen regulations and laws that would boost investor confidence. The 2009-2014 five year development plan of Kuwait has seen only limited success, at best, with many of the projects being transferred to the new five year plan of 2015-2020. However, despite the push ahead with multiple legislations and new bodies, there is evidence that implementing change will not be easy. Media reports indicate that the CMA is facing lot of pushback against its efforts to encourage corporate information disclosure and in enforcing rules against excessively speculative trading . There has been opposition to some of CMA policies that is causing delay in implementation. For instance, the reforms deadline on the corporate governance agenda has been pushed as far back as 1.5 years to June 2016.<br />
<br />
The case of Kuwait Airways is considered a good example of difficulties of privatization in Kuwait. The Airline has been making losses for quite some time and is taking steps such as retrenchment in order to cut down costs . Yet, privatization plans to modernize the airline and make it a more profitable venture has elicited resistance from various stakeholders, including company personnel and law makers . Privatization is expected to be a matter that would require great acumen and strategic thinking in order to facilitate effective implementation across various projects in the country. Closely linked to the theme of privatization is the deeply felt need to making Kuwait a great place to do business, so that it can effectively challenge regional and global leaders. In that regard, the relatively new companies and licenses law are a great boost. However, these institutions will need to be tied with larger reforms in education and infrastructure in order for foreign companies and entities to feel enticed in order to benefit from the tremendous business advantages that Kuwait offers.<br />
<br />
On the FDI front, the independent public authority, KDIPA, has complete control over its own budget and recruitment process . Kuwait&rsquo;s Ministry of Finance presides over KDIPA, which among other factors, is expected to streamline the process of decision making on FDI applications. There is already some indication of this. In September 2014, Kuwait suspended its offset obligations programme that compels foreign contractors, who win sizeable government contracts in Kuwait, to invest in some prescribed fashion in the Kuwaiti economy as part of a reciprocal gesture .<br />
<br />
Even as some broad ranging developments are taking place on the FDI front, there is hope that Kuwait will see phased liberalization in the financial services sector, as well, allowing the industry to match regional peers such as Dubai and Doha . The decision of the CBK in March 2014 to allow multiple branches of foreign banks, approved on a case by case basis, rather than only one country branch allowed under the previous regulatory regime, should be seen in this light .<br />
<br />
Kuwait passed an anti-corruption law in 2011, which included articles on money laundering and financial disclosure . In June 2013, the anti-corruption body officially got its chief. Since then, Kuwait&rsquo;s anti-corruption authority has been steadily expanding its capacity building and structural development activities . Since the executive structures and administrative capacities of the authority is in the process of solidification, it would be premature to pass an opinion on the success of the body. However, the very fact that the body has been officially created means that the government and the law makers are taking the subject seriously, with more focus and effort expected in the years ahead in what will, essentially, be a difficult and persistent exercise.<br />
<br />
The modification to the BOT law of 2008 means that local and foreign investors can now avail of a project ownership duration of 50 years in comparison with the 40 years under the previous BOT rules . This is expected to encourage investments into mega projects due to the enhanced incentive of an increased timeframe to reap the investment benefits. As Kuwait attempts to develop a more favourable domestic energy mix in order to support its larger oil revenues strategy, such regulatory developments are likely to lend immense support. For instance, the Partnerships Technical Bureau (PTB) in collaboration with Kuwait&rsquo;s Ministry of Electricity and Water (MEW), are in the process of developing an Integrated Solar Combined Cycle (ISCC) Plant to generate power with a capacity of 280 MW . The solar component will be 60 MW of the total.<br />
<br />
With respect to the National Fund for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) Development, there is lot of promise in terms of the direction in which it is moving. The fund will not only provide finance for eligible budding entrepreneurs, but will also offer support in terms of necessary training courses . Also, unlike previous small scale business funding experiments in Kuwait that focused inordinately on low-risk projects, the new SMEs fund has the mandate to cater to a calculated risk percentage, which is expected to encourage entrepreneurs to innovate . Regulatory support in terms of the labour and companies law is expected to instill greater confidence in the minds of aspirational entrepreneurs and the employees therein.<br />
<br />
The new institutions and legislations in Kuwait are trying to work in two concurrent directions. While focusing on promoting the private sector and foreign investors for economic diversification; there are also efforts at boosting financial reforms, both in the private (e.g., banks) and the public domain (government revenues and spending). It is encouraging to note Kuwait buzzing with institutional building activities. This will surely form the bedrock for further investments.<br />

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<strong>Middle East </strong>attracts tourists throughout the year for its beautiful beaches, cultural and archaeological sites, and nature tourism. The region offers various entertainment and shopping avenues, and myriad of attractions. Also considerable amount of pilgrims visit during the Hajj season.<br />
<br />
International Tourists arrivals in the Middle East remained unchanged between 2012 and 2013. However, it grew by 4% in 2014. On the contrary global international tourists&rsquo; movement grew by 4.7% per cent during 2013 - 2014. The Middle East region has a 4.5% per cent share of total world tourist arrivals, attracting additional 2mn arrivals bringing the total to 50mn.. The international tourist arrivals are expected to reach 101 million by 2020, and 149 million by 2030 . The UNWTO forecasts, international tourists arrival to grow by 2% to 5% in Middle East for 2015. Fig. 1 below shows the inbound International tourist arrivals, and tourism receipts in the Middle East region for the period 1995-2013.&nbsp;<br />

<br />
Middle East region on an average has tourism visa openness score (indicates to what extent a destination is facilitating tourism)of 18, whereas advanced economies and emerging economies have average scores of 27 and 32 respectively.&nbsp;<br />

The region has the highest percentage of the world&rsquo;s population that are able to apply for an eVisa. However, the abolishment of any visa is the lowest among all five regions, with only 1% of world population not required to obtain a visa of any kind.<br />
<br />
The UAE topped among all the GCC countries in terms of tourism visa openness scores. Tab. 1 shows openness score range for the GCC countries. The UAE has relaxed its visa procedures for 20 countries in the period 2010-13. The UAE authorities have taken many steps to make visa processing as simple as possible. Citizens of 39 countries (including other GCC nations) can avail visa-on-arrival. In addition, there are efficient systems like e-Visa, for citizens who do not belong to those 39 countries. To increase the number of tourists visiting its country, Bahrain introduced an e-Visa for 3 or 7 days to the nationals who have a Resident Permit for any GCC country, to travel to any other GCC country, if they are traveling through Bahrain International airport. The residence permit must be valid for another 6 months on the date of arrival in Bahrain.<br />

As the table shows, the UAE continues to lead the MENA region and is ranked 28th overall. Although the UAE is not endowed with rich natural resources, it has built a cultural resource base, attracting both leisure and business travellers, with several international fairs and exhibitions, and increasingly diverse industries. The most important competitive advantage of the UAE is that it is a major hub for international air travel, connecting the east to the west. Further, the country has carried out effective marketing and branding campaigns and has embraced policy rules and regulations that are conducive to the development of the sector. In particular, the country is open to foreign investments and has a liberal visa regime. The travel & tourism sector&rsquo;s direct contribution to GDP is highest for UAE among the GCC countries and is estimated at USD 31.96 billion in 2013 (8.1per cent of GDP), an increase from USD 30.6 billion in 2012 (7.97per cent of GDP). Thereafter, it is projected to expand at a CAGR of 8.37per cent to USD 56.1 billion in 2020.<br />
<br />
Expo 2020 will have a significant positive impact on the tourism sector. Expo will attract more than 25 million visitors, 70 per cent of which will be from outside the UAE &mdash; the largest number of international visitors in Expo history. These visitors will be open to discover other parts of the country thereby increasing the tourism activity. Dubai shopping festival, the biggest shopping and entertainment extravaganza in the Middle East is another technique of promoting tourism in Dubai. Their authorities ensure to organize remarkable events to attract many tourists, number of tourists have been increasing every year. In the last few years, the number of visitors to the Dubai shopping festival is estimated to be around four million and an increase of 5 to 10 per cent increase is anticipated for the 19th edition to be held in 2014.<br />
<br />
Qatar is ranked 2nd in the MENA region, and 41st overall based on Travel & Tourism competitive index. Qatar benefits from a safe and secure environment, good ICT and tourism infrastructures, and excellent air transport infrastructure, in line with its role as an air transportation hub. The ease of hiring foreign labour and the quality of its education drive the ability of the country to find high-quality human resources inside and outside the country. Qatar also has a high degree of customer orientation. Qatar placed tourism sector as a strategic pillar within its National vision 2030, it recognized that tourism can play a role in boosting the image of Qatar, diversifying its economic base and driving sustainable development in the country. The government&rsquo;s strategy over the last few years has been to promote sustainable tourism by improving transport infrastructure and developing attractions, such as the Museum of Islamic Art and the Cultural Village. Qatar has won the bid to host the FIFA 2022 world cup; the country&rsquo;s tourism authority plans to invest about $20 billion on tourism infrastructure as the number of tourist arrivals grows at a rate of 15.9 per cent compounded annually, to reach 3.7 million by 2022.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Bahrain is ranked 4th in the region and 55th overall. The country maintains a number of clear strengths: good transport infrastructure; high-quality human resources in the country; and strong price competitiveness. However, Bahrain is witnessing a weakening in its tourism infrastructure, as health and hygiene standards, and ICT infrastructure struggle to keep up with rapid population growth. Also, its limited natural resources and poor environmental sustainability do not help the country to attract tourists. UNWTO organized an International Conference on Exploring New Cultural Horizons for Tourism, in 2013, in Manama, Bahrain. The Conference was aimed to explore new horizons for cultural tourism, identify innovative means to widen communities&rsquo; involvement in the development of tourism products based on cultural heritage assets, in particular on the intangible heritage and living culture of host populations, thus creating new socio-economic opportunities for all through sustainable and responsible tourism development.<br />

Saudi Arabia is witnessing massive investments and expansion projects in an attempt to attract larger number of tourists to the Kingdom. One of the major projects is the expansion of King Abdul Aziz International Airport, which is poised to accommodate up to 80 million travellers by 2035 . The Jeddah Summer Festival is one of the largest events in the Kingdom. In 2013, the festival attracted roughly around 2 million visitors. The festival, which includes programs for families, children, and youth, provides investment opportunities to investors in the tourism sector. According to Supreme Commission for Tourism and Antiquities (SCTA), visitors to Jeddah during the festival spend over SR 4 billion on hotels and restaurants and the visitor arrival numbers are expected to increase at a CAGR of 10&ndash;20per cent every year . The huge spending bodes well for the provincial economy and domestic tourism in the Kingdom as a whole, with occupancy rates in hotels going up significantly. The spending also benefits local industries. The number of people performing Hajj is increasing by the year, and is estimated to increase to almost 17 million by 2025. The high number of travellers has contributed to the development of the religious tourism industry.<br />

The residence permit must be valid for another 6 months on the date of arrival in Bahrain.<br />

		<Title>[:en]3 reasons why GCC automotive market is facing slump[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]Automobile is an essential part of the lifestyle of middle east citizens and hence forms an important component of GCC’s annual imports. The region enjoys higher ownership of automobiles primarily attributable to per capita income above the world average.

<a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/gcc-automobile-sector/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignleft wp-image-3805 size-large" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GCC-Automobile-Sector_1200x150-1024x128.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="105" /></a>

Middle East imports, often fluctuates with oil prices and so is the case with automobile imports too. But what is noteworthy is the sharp decline in imports of automobiles by value and more particularly by number of vehicles during 2016 and 2017, with no signs of reversal in 2018. Automobile imports by value shrunk (-)16% in 2016, while imports by number shrunk (-)24.4% in 2016. Though the decline in imports by value recovered (+0.4%) in 2017 (and grew by 18% in 2018), imports by number continued to further decline by (-)16.9% in 2017 and (-)8.9% in 2018 respectively. In 2018 the automobiles or passenger car net imports accounted for USD 22 billion or about 4.2 % of total imports of goods of USD 522 billion by the GCC countries (they accounted for 5.5% of imports by value in 2014). What could have been the reasons for the slump is a matter of discussion and analysis for all stakeholders?

<strong>GCC Auto Imports Slump (by Value and by Numbers)</strong>

Fluctuations in oil prices could have been the reason for the slump in demand, but the data reveals a contrary trend, which indicates that the auto demand continued to decline despite recovery in oil prices in 2017. Other factors possibly responsible for the slump may include the below:

- Demand Cyclicality that is characteristic of the Industry in GCC.

- Demographic Changes that are happening in GCC.

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]Most of us, who do not belong to the field of computer sciences, are painstakingly unaware when it comes to the world of programming languages and are afraid to even try and attempt to understand it. There are alphabets, and numbers, and symbols, all working together to form a giant web of disarray (or an artistic masterpiece; depending on how you look at it). We might have had a brief encounter with them in our school life, but have since looked the other way whenever presented with an opportunity to learn more about them later on. However, in doing so, we forget that coders and programming languages have fundamentally changed the way of life.

Coding is making a shift from side-stream to mainstream. A recruiter might no longer judge an applicant by the degrees he/she holds, but the knowledge and experience in a particular programming language. A working understanding of a programming language takes a few years of practice before one can manage to comprehend a code, and therefore an individual with these skills at their disposal can have an upper hand amongst an increasingly competitive world.

<a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/shift-to-electric-vehicles-how-will-it-impact-gcc-automobiles-sector/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignnone wp-image-3862 size-large" title="Shift to Electric Vehicles – How will it impact GCC Automobiles Sector" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Shift-to-Electric-Vehicles-How-will-it-impact-GCC-Automobiles-sector_1200x150_Buy-now-1024x128.jpg" alt="Shift to Electric Vehicles – How will it impact GCC Automobiles Sector" width="840" height="105" /></a>

As technology becomes more and more integrated into the core business of an organization, we are increasingly witnessing the rise of an in-house tech team to manage the day to day functioning of the code base, similar to that of an in-house finance team. Computer programming as skill is therefore evolving from a field that used to be open exclusively to engineers, to a one that is a prerequisite in any and every industrial spectrum. As automation tools, web designing, statistical modelling, AI and machine learning become integral to the functioning of organizations, the knowledge of a programming language is increasingly becoming a “must have” qualification for any new applicant.
<h2><strong>Industry Roles Ripe for Disruption</strong></h2>
It is difficult to think of a job role today, which cannot be automated by a piece of code in the future. From portfolio management and digital marketing to medical diagnosis and legal advisors, almost all job roles are ripe for disruption sometime in the future.

Recent advancements in technology and automation are disrupting some of the traditional roles in the <strong>finance</strong> industry. Stock picking which was ones a highly coveted skill, is now being pushed to the corner as pension funds, retirement plans, and even retail investors are moving towards passive funds that run on autopilot. Accounting is no exception. In recent years, we see the implementation of Artificial intelligence and Blockchain technology slowly taking over the accounting industry. It is only a matter of time before people with no knowledge on computer programs start struggling to get a job. Whether you are in banking, risk management, portfolio management, or any other field of finance, your role either already requires or will soon require you to be able to program in at least one programming language. As businesses become more and more automated and technology driven, finance professionals with programming skills are going to be in demand and can help you stay relevant in the job market.

Not only finance, but with the digitalisation of society, <strong>marketing</strong> too is experiencing a renaissance. Marketing jobs are increasingly dependent on the need to be able to create, modify and maintain websites. Everyone seems to be fighting for customer attention on every social media platform, which can then lead to revenue via advertisements. Therefore, Digital Marketing roles nowadays require you to possess programming skills, especially when it comes to Search Engine Optimization (SEO). SEO is the process of increasing the quality and quantity of website traffic by increasing the visibility of a website or a web page to existing and potential users.

For <strong>medical practitioner</strong>, the advantages that come with the ability to code are tremendous. New healthcare applications and platforms are arising faster than ever before, many of which, founded by Doctors and Nurses themselves. In an era of electronic medical records and telemedicine, it is handy to be technically proficient. Doctors could therefore leverage their combined knowledge of computer science and medicine to tackle the rising complexity in health care problems. Tech-savvy doctors at Stanford Children's Hospital in the United States launched a mobile program in 2015 that allowed diabetic patients share their blood glucose levels with their providers and caregivers. In 2019, they designed a new mobile app to help patients quickly find a doctor, call for an appointment, access their medical records and navigate the hospital campus (Healthier.stanfordchildrens). All across the globe, hospitals have built apps to study asthma, Parkinson's disease, autism, epilepsy, breast cancer and other ailments (Kqed.org).

The roles played out by an <strong>architect</strong> and a programmer are also quite similar. One designs the physical spaces around, while the latter designs virtual user interfaces. Coding could thereby help architects explore new architectural forms and investigate how architecture can evolve and adapt to the ever-changing. Usually, design tools use various complex automation routine algorithms, which many architects fail to understand, hence their usage of the tool is limited and their overall efficiency is reduced. However, if they know exactly what these algorithms represent and how they influence the outcome of a geometry, they can make much more conscious and efficient decisions in the design process.

Moreover, <strong>managers</strong> with a knowledge on programming would not only be able to have better discussion with developers, but will also be able to conveying instructions with clarity. It would also give them the knowledge to try to better the code as well as solve minor issues on their own without depending much on the developer.
<h2><strong>Basic Overview on Programming Languages</strong></h2>
Programming languages help us make decisions based on logical rules, automate mundane repetitive tasks, and manipulate data with ease. Programming languages are mainly used to control the performance of a machine or to express algorithms. Several different programming languages have been created and more are created every year, each with their own unique features.<strong> HTML, Ruby</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong> are great for building web sites; Java and C++ are often used to develop software and run infrastructures, whereas Python and R are the tools of choice for analysing statistics. Languages often make trade-offs in terms of convenience, safety, and speed, much like vehicles. The trade-off is dictated by the job at hand. Because each language is different, each may be best suited for a certain purpose.

At their most foundational level, programming languages all serve the same purpose, which is to turn human thoughts into binary code of 1’s and 0’s that a computer understands. However, on the surface, where humans interact with them, they vary a lot. With a strong need for unique and diverse programming languages, it is virtually impossible to create a single universal programming language that meets all needs. Moreover, programming languages are often revised and even combined with other languages over time, in order to meet the evolving technological needs. A programming language is therefore a tool for humans to express ideas to computers. A tractor-trailer, a bicycle, and a Tesla are all vehicles. They all have wheels and steering and will get you from point A to point B. However, we use them for different things. Programming languages are similar. Beyond mere utility, developers choose tools based on personal tastes. Because there are many choices for good programming languages, developers can select the one that works the best for them.

Most of the popular programming languages under discussion are “open source”, which means that no one owns them and no one profits out of their use.  Open source software refers to the software, which uses the code freely available on the Internet. The code can be copied, modified or deleted by other users and organizations. It is developed by a combined effort, under which programmers from all over the world improve upon the code and share the changes with the public. As the software is open to the public and several people work on its improvement, the result is that it constantly updates, improves and expands.

Closed source software on the other hand means that the software is a proprietary and closely guarded code. Only the original authors of software can access, copy, and alter that software. In a case with closed source software, users do not purchase the software, but only pay to use it.
<h2><strong>Application Perspective </strong></h2>
There are numerous general and all-purpose programming languages, each with their own specialties, advantages and disadvantages. However, while the democratisation of coding and assistance from vast code libraries has made it easier to become a coder, other developments have made life more challenging for professional coders. An ever-evolving technological environment means skills need to be updated frequently and client prefer coders with mastery of multiple languages, also called full-stack developers.

As per the Developer Survey Results 2019 by Stack Overflow, more people use JavaScript than use any other programming language. PHP appears to be falling out of favour as popularity for Python rises. For the seventh year in a row, JavaScript is the most commonly used programming language used by 68% of the survey respondents. Python, now the fourth most popular programming language, was used by 41.7% of respondents at Stack Overflow survey. In 2019, Python edged out Java in overall ranking, much as if it surpassed C# last year and PHP the year before making it the fastest-growing major programming language today.

<strong>The Evolution of Programming Languages (% of programmers using the language)</strong>

<strong>Python</strong> has seen maximum adoption in the finance industry because of its ease of use, and a large number of open source libraries available that you can use to incorporate into your programs. Some of the largest investment banks and hedge funds have used it to build their core trading and risk management systems. Python is also very suitable for data analytics, which is at the heart of finance.

There are also several specialized programming languages, used for their edge in specific tasks. These include programming languages such as <strong>Haskell</strong>, and statistical programming languages such as <strong>MATLAB</strong> and <strong>R programming</strong>. Haskell is a functional programming language with application in many industries and applied in many projects. For example, ABN AMRO used it in a project where they wanted to measure the counterparty risk on portfolios of financial derivatives for their investment banking activities. MATLAB and R-Programming are statistical languages and are a great add-on along with a general programming language such as Python. R has a great developer community around it and very interesting packages to help users perform a variety of analysis. R also has good support for big data analytics. We have also seen a rise in specialised programing languages that are built into a financial software. For example, TradingStation, a technical analysis software, has a trader’s programming language called EasyLanguage, which allows you to create and modify indicators and trading strategies.

<a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/gcc-regulatory-review-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignnone wp-image-3881 size-large" title="GCC Regulatory Review – 2019" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GCC-Regulatory-Review-2019_1200x150-1024x128.jpg" alt="GCC Regulatory Review – 2019" width="840" height="105" /></a>

Apart from programming languages, there is also a high demand for database management professionals.  <strong>SQL</strong>, which is a language of working with databases, helps to effectively store, retrieve, and modify data from the databases.

For individuals willing to expand their knowledge base to best prepare for any future uncertainties, a useful strategy would therefore be to learn Python/Java Script (a general-purpose language), R-programming (for specialised statistical abilities) and SQL (the top database query language used in most organizations).
<blockquote>In summary, we have a variety of programming languages and this diversity makes interesting programs, interesting companies, and interesting careers possible. The world that we are currently living in, and the world that is slowly unravelling in front of our eyes, is and will increasingly be dominated by these pieces of codes. It is a language, which not only helps us interact with the physical world, but also with the digital world in our day-to-day lives. Technological revolution stops for no one and disruption in the core fundamentals of any industry is the major driving force in its evolution. This disruption gives birth to new job roles and individuals with dynamic abilities would be the ones to capitalize on them.</blockquote>

		<Title>[:en]Estimating future returns for Saudi Arabia Stock Market[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<h2><span style="color: #005596;">Need an equity market framework</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is a classic mistake that all of us can be guilty of at some point in time. Mistaking historical stock market returns as a good proxy for future returns. While optimism breeds optimism, pessimism breeds pessimism. If we have a great decade (like how S&P 500 is), it will be nearly impossible to be utterly pessimistic and vice versa. Time and again it has been proved that history never repeats but rhymes. However, intuitively it is the “repeat” storyline (be it optimistic or pessimistic) that is constantly played to the gallery to the detriment of client interest.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While developing capital market expectations across a range of asset classes is well developed in the developed markets, they are yet to gain great applications in the emerging market space. We have several major providers of capital market expectations like JP Morgan, Invesco and Research Affiliates whose calls on the long-term market returns is summarized in the appendix. While they may not be precise or accurate, nevertheless they give a sense of expectations that are structured based on good application of quantitative techniques.</p>


[caption id="attachment_3910" align="alignnone" width="840"]<a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/equity-market-return-expectations-for-saudi-arabia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="wp-image-3910 size-large" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CME_1200x150-1024x128.jpg" alt="Equity Market Return Expectations for Saudi Arabian TASI Index, 2020-2024" width="840" height="105" /></a> Ad: Marmore Research Report[/caption]
<p style="text-align: left;">In the world of portfolios, the application of expected returns, risk and correlation cannot be emphasized more. They form the bedrock of asset allocation and meaningful client outcomes. However, undertaking such a task in the emerging market context is laden with several risks including that of lack of long history, quality of data, and wide range of scenarios possible given the fluidity of the situation. In general, returns are decomposed into the following three components:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">- Dividend yield
- Earnings growth &
- P/E expansion or contraction</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Projecting future returns is a function of various variables that should go into these three aspects. While emerging markets may exhibit some sort of stability in terms of dividend yields, they may experience erratic earnings pattern and P/E designs due to market inefficiencies and idiosyncrasies.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the context of Saudi Arabia, which hosts the world’s biggest oil producer Saudi Aramco, the equity capital market is more developed than debt market. Hence, capital market expectations will lend themselves nicely to equity asset class. Equity markets may exhibit homogeneity in terms of dividend yield, but can exhibit heterogeneity when it comes to earnings growth and P/E behavior. Also they may have more dimensions in terms of Sharia and conventional. It requires good amount of sanitized data along with good application of quantitative techniques to develop future expected returns for Saudi Arabia equity markets.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Marmore, recently conducted a poll on social media, wherein about 300 responses were received for return expectations of Saudi Arabia equity market for the 5-year period of 2020 – 2024. About 2/3rd of the total respondents hoped for positive returns, while 1/3rd of the respondents indicated negative returns. 37% of the respondents favored a return expectation of more than 5%, while 29% of the respondents expected returns to be range bound between 0% to 5%. Interestingly, among the respondents who expected negative returns, a majority of them voted for returns worse than negative 5%.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Saudi stock market</b> following the successful listing of Saudi Aramco IPO has garnered the attention from investors worldwide. However, the lack of future return expectations for the <b>Saudi stock market</b> (Tadawul index) has been a hurdle for investors who would like to consider Saudi Arabia market in their portfolio. If developed it will help Investment advisors, portfolio managers and wealth managers to model their client portfolios based on objectively derived capital market expectations. This exercise will also help robo advisors engaged with developing portfolio management applications and other technology related aspects. Institutional investors like pension funds and sovereign wealth funds can also hugely benefit by having a long-term view on Saudi Arabia equity markets based on the market fundamentals.</p>

		<Title>[:en]Data Science and its Economic Potential for the GCC[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<blockquote><span style="color: #005596;"><a style="color: #00ccff;" href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/data-is-the-new-oil-for-gcc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data is the new oil</a></span>; emerging technological applications like data science, Artificial Intelligence and analytics have made data a more valuable commodity.
Leveraging data science can aid in extracting valuable information from the raw data. Such insights will open up new avenues of growth in the present digital economy; Data science applications have already made some <a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/gcc-economic-and-investment-themes-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">economic impact in key GCC sectors</a> like oil and gas, finance and healthcare.
The GCC governments also generates large amounts of data hence effective use of the government data can bring immense economic benefits to the region.
The government and business organisations across the GCC have developed comprehensive data strategies that will enable its various sectors/firms to enhance their competiveness and productivity in the present dynamic economic landscape.</blockquote>
In the GCC region, the state remains a major force in driving the economic progress and social welfare. Worldwide, it is emerging that data science is a key enabler for governments as they seek to deliver targeted and better services to the public in different realms. Even in the GCC, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is shifting service delivery operations to cyberspace, through its e-government and smart government digital transitions. According to Strategy& (part of the PwC network), the data economy in the GCC is estimated to be around $5.0 billion, which is about 0.3% of GCC’s GDP (2018).

<strong>What is Data Science?</strong>
Data science is the collective process that uses theoretical, mathematical, computational, and practical methods like algorithms, and statistics to review, analyze and extract valuable knowledge and information from raw data. Data science enables individuals and organizations to extract required or valuable information that may be used for multiple purposes, such as decision making, product development, trend analysis and forecasting.

Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) is increasingly changing the data landscape and is significantly impacting every aspect of human lives, including businesses, science, and governance. In that context, data science is a synthesis of statistics, <a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/deep-learning-a-more-interesting-aspect-of-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">advanced computing technology and AI</a>. The strategic advantage lies in the integration across assorted and interdependent complex data resources to support real-time decision-making.

<a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/data-is-the-new-oil-for-gcc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3917" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Data-is-the-new-oil-for-GCC_1200x150-1024x128.jpg" alt="Data is the new oil for GCC | White Paper" width="840" height="105" /></a>

<strong>Practical Implementation of Data Science</strong>
Practical applications appear to be flowing from data science applications in the GCC. For e.g., in the UAE, The Ministry of Health and Prevention (MoHAP) signed a memorandum of understanding—in November 2019—with The British University in Dubai (BUiD) (<a href="https://www.mohap.gov.ae/en/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Health & Prevention. UAE</a>). The agreement is aimed at enhancing cooperation in health statistical researches, thereby helping in the planning and enacting of health policies.

The private sector too is actively seeking data science expertise. For e.g., in 2018, AlRaedah Finance, a <a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/estimating-future-returns-for-saudi-arabia-stock-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial services in Saudi Arabia</a>, chose DataRobot, an automated machine learning company, to use the latter’s data science prowess to develop and further deploy sophisticated predictive models for enabling smarter and quicker business decisions (<a href="http://saudigazette.com.sa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Saudi Gazette</a>).

In the GCC, the financial services sector is considered the most adept in the adoption of data science. For e.g., banks are deploying their up-to-date storage of data to offer end-to-end services for clients, with continuous connectivity between various channels, and partnerships with other service providers to support immediate payments; loan processing; etc (<a href="https://www.ey.com/en_sa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EY</a>). The proliferation of big data, AI-based analytics, and voice and facial recognition elements will enable better customer journeys, going forward.

Practical innovations that make life easier are key. For e.g., the large Saudi telecoms provider, STC, developed a smart parking service that uses wireless sensors to guide users on where the nearby vacant parking slots are positioned (<a href="https://www.stc.com.sa/wps/wcm/connect/english/business/business" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Saudi Telecom Company</a>). For GCC, the transformation of large data sets and associated data into practically actionable intelligence is the underlying promise of data science.

Availability of leadership commitment and state of the art technology and infrastructure foundation serve as advantages to the GCC countries to set ambitious targets in terms of being leaders in data science. This is evident from the GCC government initiatives like UAE’s Smart Data Strategy, Tasmu Qatar, KSA Open and Big Data Strategy and Bahrain Open Data Strategy.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>
It is evident that the current degree and maturity of data science implementation will vary broadly between GCC countries and within sectors, but the trend of stakeholders looking to new technologies and partnerships will only keep increasing. Start-ups that support data-led activities such as encryption, distributed ledger technologies, etc., could also proliferate.

The new data environment creates new opportunities to governments and other stakeholders involved in policy processes. Therefore, every actor including governments, universities, think tanks and civic movements will have to strengthen their data science capacity.

		<Title>[:en]Bankers can finally look forward to merger activity[:ar]يمكن للمصرفيين أخيرًا أن يتطلعوا إلى نشاط الاندماج[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<div style="text-align: justify;">

The article originally appeared in The National | Business

<div style="text-align: justify;">

The fee-based investment banking business has four key components – syndicated loans, equity capital markets, debt capital markets and mergers and acquisitions (M&A). While in other markets we can witness activity across these four components, in the GCC investment banking advisers depend on syndicated loans for their survival – 50 per cent of total investment banking fees on average.

Equities is dull thanks to poor performing capital markets and the related dull initial public offering environment.

The debt capital market looks promising given the slew of activity expected from sovereigns and corporates.

However, the sticky point seems to be M&A, which can be erratic and suffers from some idiosyncrasies.

The fallout of the global financial crisis and the recent oil price crash have dented the stamina of corporates, leading to weaker balance sheets for many companies. The operating environment has become difficult because of stagnant earnings and increased cost of capital. After hitting a peak of US$70 billion in 2014, our research expects that corporate earnings will touch $62bn this year. This should be a dream environment for M&A advisers, as difficult environments force corporates to restructure, improve efficiency and productivity, hive off non-core assets and concentrate on strategic business. In other words, corporates need the help of M&A advisers to do all this.

However, the value of announced M&A transactions reached $18.7bn during the first half of this year, a decline of 29 per cent compared with a year earlier, and the slowest first six months for deal-making in the region since 2014, according to Reuters.

What can explain this conundrum?
The GCC market is dominated more by private companies than public companies. Scouting opportunities in the private market are onerously difficult because of lack of transparency and family control. This prevents deal flow even though there may be genuine need for M&A. Even when assuming healthy deal flows (cases where companies express interest to hive off non-strategic units), the actual completion of transactions can be low (poor deal closures), as poor information can prevent meaningful negotiations and conclusion of transactions.

The M&A environment in the GCC is also characterised by dominance of "mega" deals. Take the recent example of Emaar Properties chairman Mohamed Alabbar leading a group that bought a $2.36bn stake in Americana along with a group of investors; or the merger of National Bank of Abu Dhabi and FGB, which is expected to create a mega-bank with total assets of about $171bn; or the celebrated Emirates Bank and National Bank of Dubai merger to form Emirates NBD in 2007.

Such mega-deals can crowd out other transactions and can also create league tables – rankings of investment bankers – that can look very different and distorted from one period to another, thus making it difficult to compare.

How will things be going forward?
Given the low oil price environment, corporate stress levels are bound to increase. The need to restructure, enhance productivity and efficiency and hive off unnecessary non-strategic assets will be pursued vigorously by private and public players.

This should certainly be good news for investment bankers. Also, it is unusual that companies are sitting on very high levels of cash as measured by data available for publicly listed companies. At the end of last year, total cash levels reached about $250bn, with financials (read banking) accounting for $155bn. Hence, banking-related M&A transactions will continue to see action, followed by energy and telecoms. Mega- deals may continue to dominate the scene, but given the oil price effect across the board, representation from mid-level segments and SMEs can also increase.

This will help to improve the ratio of pipeline to closure, which should be good news for investment bankers.

This should be a dream environment for M&A advisers, as difficult environments force corporates to restructure, improve efficiency and productivity, hive off non-core assets and concentrate on strategic business. In other words, corporates need the help of M&A advisers to do all this.

However, the value of announced M&A transactions reached $18.7bn during the first half of this year, a decline of 29 per cent compared with a year earlier, and the slowest first six months for deal-making in the region since 2014, according to Reuters.

What can explain this conundrum?
The GCC market is dominated more by private companies than public companies. Scouting opportunities in the private market are onerously difficult because of lack of transparency and family control. This prevents deal flow even though there may be genuine need for M&A. Even when assuming healthy deal flows (cases where companies express interest to hive off non-strategic units), the actual completion of transactions can be low (poor deal closures), as poor information can prevent meaningful negotiations and conclusion of transactions.

The M&A environment in the GCC is also characterised by dominance of "mega" deals. Take the recent example of Emaar Properties chairman Mohamed Alabbar leading a group that bought a $2.36bn stake in Americana along with a group of investors; or the merger of National Bank of Abu Dhabi and FGB, which is expected to create a mega-bank with total assets of about $171bn; or the celebrated Emirates Bank and National Bank of Dubai merger to form Emirates NBD in 2007.

Such mega-deals can crowd out other transactions and can also create league tables – rankings of investment bankers – that can look very different and distorted from one period to another, thus making it difficult to compare.

How will things be going forward?
Given the low oil price environment, corporate stress levels are bound to increase. The need to restructure, enhance productivity and efficiency and hive off unnecessary non-strategic assets will be pursued vigorously by private and public players.

This should certainly be good news for investment bankers. Also, it is unusual that companies are sitting on very high levels of cash as measured by data available for publicly listed companies. At the end of last year, total cash levels reached about $250bn, with financials (read banking) accounting for $155bn. Hence, banking-related M&A transactions will continue to see action, followed by energy and telecoms. Mega- deals may continue to dominate the scene, but given the oil price effect across the board, representation from mid-level segments and SMEs can also increase.

This will help to improve the ratio of pipeline to closure, which should be good news for investment bankers.

Globally while China is almost achieving standstill in new Covid-19 cases, the epicenter that shifted to Europe is now located in the United States where new cases are growing at an alarming rate. In Europe, Italy and Spain the biggest sufferers still grieve, while countries like UK are taking steps to prevent growth, stem the tide and recover. GCC countries are also reporting an increase in new cases every day. On the brighter side, India the second largest populated nation is just seeing its Corona cases curve show some distant positive trend, which is however yet to be fully analyzed by the medical professionals assisted by Data Scientists. The recently seen large additions of cases in many countries might be partly due to increase in testing which results in coverage of a wider segment of population, therefore the growth can be due to increase in infections or due to new discoveries of existing cases. Positive signs to watch out would be flattening of the new confirmed cases curve (decelerating growth) followed by higher recovery rate and finally an end to new cases or coming up with medicines to treat the virus.

India started a 21-day lockdown effective March 24th, 2020 and similar is the case with GCC, Europe and USA. So, today the world at large is in a lockdown with hundreds of millions of people confined to homes and thousands of businesses shutdown responding to the call of the governments for such an action in the wider public interest, causing economic hardship to many in the lower sections of the society as well as economic hardship to business and other segments caused by the consequent slump in economic output.

However, world at large has the advantage of knowing what China has done for treatment of the virus and how long it enforced the lockdown and how long it took to stem the tide, though how far it is helpful is still being observed. Treatment infrastructure is being built up in countries like USA, and less endowed nations like India and some parts of Europe, though currently woefully inadequate. It is encouraging to note that about 20% of infected patients have recovered from the illness. However, until positive signals come from USA currently the largest affected country and being the largest economy in the world, uncertainty and worry will continue to persist.

It can be expected that in post Covid-19, the world may see many changes in the behavior of population whether it is international tourism, international business travel, the way retail markets are structured and function and e-commerce trends. We also expect changes to the approach of asset managers of publicly managed funds with respect to asset allocation. The world will also be prepared from people, systems and public health services. The use of remote communications for services will increase manifold. This crisis will also improve maturity of government leadership and bureaucracy and maturity of financial markets.

The G-20 countries that account for a large part of the world economy announced more than USD 5 trillion Government Stimulus programs of which a stimulus of USD 2 trillion was announced by US, the world’s largest economy. Whether, this will lead to a period of return of inflation needs to be assessed, and if that happens without growth it can lead to stagflation. But given pre-Covid-19 impressive growth of the world economy, a quick rebound from the Covid-19 triggered short-lived recession may be a likely scenario. Whether the post 2008 story of quantitative easing that led to increase in gold prices and a long bull market for stocks in US will be repeated with the current stimulus packages that are larger than the previous one needs to be seen (currently US FAANG Stocks are at a high, making further increase in DOW Index a case of uncertainty). So also, will Emerging Markets (EM) see large US fund flows like after the previous downturn and what will be the outcome needs to be seen. An analysis of the differences in structure of stimulus packages of the US in 2008 and now (2020) may give us some insights into the expected behavior of financial and commodity markets. Fall in stock markets due to the Covid-19 economic recession can impact the GCC economies, as was the case in 2008-2009, as today the fall is aggravated by the lower oil prices. However, will lowered capital spending by all oil producers influence future oil prices and their economies. This question is especially relevant for countries dependent on new oil discoveries to benefit from the next oil price cycle, unlike GCC countries like Saudi Arabia which are better off due to large proven oil reserves and low exploration costs.

What will happen to the currencies is another matter of speculation, in the light of the different levels of Covid-19 stimulus packages, fall in economic growth, lower oil prices, increased public spending outlays for healthcare, increase in government debt levels, resulting fiscal deficits and inflationary expectations, etc.

The lessening of dependence of the world on China for supply chains is being talked about and maybe countries like India may benefit partly, though it is too early to say. The lower oil prices if sustained at a range of sub USD 40 for few years as indicated by current oil futures may mean a slowdown of Electric Vehicles demand and installation of new capacities to grow as gasoline becomes cheaper, but it needs to be watched as the call for climate control is strong and fear psychosis of the population from this pandemic may make stoke fears among the governments and people and become wary of ignoring measures like climate control which will be more compelling.

The first requirement today is a decline and stemming of Covid-19 cases that will give all a huge sigh of relief and hope to the world at large and next a lot needs to be thought, analyzed, planned and achieved to resume activities and bring normalcy to the world population and the world economies.

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]Artificial intelligence (AI) has been around for decades, but the technology today gains prominence with the enormous availability of data and the increasing computational speed. AI is a broader concept that encompasses multiple tools and can be defined as a constellation of technologies, from machine learning to natural language processing that allows machines to sense, comprehend, act and learn (<a href="https://www.accenture.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accenture</a>). The present promising AI products like self-driving vehicles, digital assistance from SIRI to CORTANA are some of the results of evolved research in the field of AI and Machine learning techniques. Big tech companies are not just focusing on increasing productivity and operational efficiencies with AI but also centers on adding AI capabilities to their products, making them more sophisticated. Over the last few decades, huge progress has been made in AI spaces like pattern recognition, machine translation, image recognition and so on. Additionally, Machine Learning algorithms that learn from data, unlike any rule-based programming, are now made more advanced. Automation of routine, repetitive tasks and automation of the decision-making process without human intervention are some of the key endeavours that AI promises to deliver.

A broader proposition is that AI will markedly stimulate economic growth, improve productivity and likely improve the quality of life. However, it appears that much of the potential AI applications have been vaunted. Even with such clear postulations that AI can potentially enhance businesses and improve productivity, businesses and public organizations are taking a guarded approach in deploying AI on their business functions. There are critical technical challenges that likely impedes its practical applications, and this largely surrounds the data used for analysis. As AI is only as good as the data we provide, data becomes a critical component in the AI/ML applications. The algorithms require vast data sets to identify the trends, patterns, to predict and produce the desired outcome.

AI and ML models thrive on huge volumes of data, thus, AI applications in entirety depend on quality data. The data has to be trained to do the clearly defined task; a well-trained data model is a key component for its large scale adoption. Machine learning models require access to accurate/complete data, therefore, availability of qualitative reliable data becomes a critical need for the performance of these learning algorithms. Poor data inputs can skew results and could lead to systemic risks, for instance, the October flash-crash of the pound-sterling was likely due to an overzealous trading algorithm, which dropped the currency by almost 10 percent (<a href="https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KPMG</a>). Bias in AI systems is another key challenge that could affect the decision making process. There are number of ongoing researches and discussions to address AI biases that could be detrimental to society and businesses. In addition, most of the machine learning algorithms lack interpretation hence does not provide the reasoning or the criteria used for its predicted outcomes.

Essentially, there is an evident gap between the AI/ML in theory and those in practical implementation. While there are a number of caveats in realizing the full potential of AI/ML technologies, AI/ML techniques are widely implemented in companies/businesses that find its clear applications; those include sectors like media and entertainment, e-commerce, healthcare, and financial services. Within these sectors, AI has primarily benefitted in functions like providing recommendations, marketing and digital assistance, predominantly using its predictive capabilities.

<strong>Exhibit 1: Indicative List of Sectors/Industries that Capitalize on AI</strong>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4296" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AI-and-ML-Marmore_Article_Indicative-List-of-Sectors-that-Capitalize-on-AI.jpg" alt="Exhibit 1: Indicative List of Sectors/Industries that Capitalize on AI" width="870" height="387" />

In understanding the gap between the concept and practice, it is also necessary to weigh other wide-ranging factors that could encumber the practical adoption of AI/ML models. For instance, regulations will play a significant role in setting the platform for AI adoption and growth. To enact AI at large scale, regulators and policymakers should establish a clear strategy that enables the transition for such a technological future. For AI to be successful in a large industrial context, open data and data sharing might become a prerequisite. However, the regulations/policies in this space are yet to be standardized, the pace of the regulatory response does not match with the pace of these technological developments; when new regulations on data security, privacy are in place there could be real world barriers for AI deployment.

<a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/data-is-the-new-oil-for-gcc/"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3917" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Data-is-the-new-oil-for-GCC_1200x150-1024x128.jpg" alt="Data is the new oil for GCC | White Paper" width="840" height="105" /></a>

Similarly, AI applications, when integrated with businesses and industries, are expected to increase productivity and efficiency; however, these entities lack the necessary enabling infrastructure. Additionally, AI design and adoption incurs high resource costs. With these, lack of AI expertise and subject matter experts presents other challenges to leverage the maximal potential of AI.

While research in AI and machine learning techniques is a multi-decade journey, most organizations have a long way to go in unleashing its application in practice. The last few decades have seen remarkable growth in AI/ML research; however, organizations have been slow in AI adoption and have not capitalized with these techniques yet. The technology is far less likely to be considered advanced at this stage, hence could be unreliable in deploying across critical sectors like healthcare and law. However, research and investment in AI is accelerating as various industries/sector look to embrace innovation, increase competitiveness and efficiency. With the proactive research agenda across entities, the AI/ML space will likely see maturity. The ongoing research and developments could develop solutions that might far outweigh its downsides and reduce the gulf between theory and practice.

		<Title>[:en]The oil price war - Saudi Arabia and Russia adding more fuel to the fire[:ar]حرب أسعار النفط – ارتفاع الخلافات بين المملكة العربية السعودية وروسيا.[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]At a time when economies worldwide have been put under stress and are contemplating the negative <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #005596;" href="https://www.marmoremena.com/research-reports/special-reports/coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">impact of COVID-19</a></span>, the last thing they would have wanted was a price war between two of the world’s largest oil producers. Coming into the year 2020, the overarching theme was a dip in global oil demand that would need strict supply restrictions to balance the Oil markets. However, with Russia’s non-cooperative stance and Saudi Arabia’s subsequent retaliation, oil prices have tumbled down to record lows. Saudi Arabia’s reversal in stance to raise output by 2 million barrels per day and offer discounts on its oil came as a surprise as it has been a strong advocate of the supply cuts to keep prices high in recent years.
<h3>Why are they doing it?</h3>
Russia, despite also being heavily dependent on revenues from oil, decided to walk away from OPEC’s proposal and let prices fall. It is widely perceived as an attempt to hit the U.S. that has been using export sanctions as a tool against other economies. Keeping oil prices low would hurt high-cost shale producers in the U.S., driving them out of business and would undermine the U.S. influence on the energy market. With a significant amount of financial cushion, Russia has the capability to withstand a period of low oil prices without straining its budget too much in the short term. Saudi Arabia on the other hand refused to budge, stating its intent to ramp up production and increase its global market share. Considering Saudi Arabia’s ambitious diversification plans and the ineffectiveness of its previous oil price war, the move could be a ploy to bring Russia back to the negotiation table. Both sides refuse to budge so far, with the Russian Oil minister stating that they enough resources to cover budget shortfalls for the next 10 years if prices remain between USD 25-30 per barrel. Saudi Arabia, likewise, has ramped up production, regaining its position from the U.S. as the world’s largest oil producer.

The global manufacturing scene looked bleak, facing slowdowns in major economies across the globe. Global oil demand had already been trending downwards, with oil prices falling from interim highs reached during 2018. With a preliminary trade deal in place, demand was expected to gradually pickup. The spread of <a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/research-reports/special-reports/coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #005596;">COVID-19</span></a> quickly played spoilsport, adding further pressure from a demand side. The supply side was already under great pressure, needing oil producers to effect further cuts. In such a situation, the decision to ramp up production will only make things worse, flooding the market with cheap oil. The imbalances caused by simultaneous demand and supply shocks could end up disastrous especially when countries around are already reeling under pressure to reinvigorate economic activity. The pandemic has already forced several countries to go into lockdown, with many others set to follow. It is estimated that there might be a 25% demand contraction as a result of this pandemic. Several oil exporting countries are highly dependent on oil revenues to support their spending and balance their budgets. Low oil prices and a slowdown in activity would be a recipe for disaster for some of those nations whose financial reserves are low.
<h3>Who are the losers in this war?</h3>
The two primary parties involved, namely Saudi Arabia and Russia are not completely immune, having a set of problems of their own. Russia seems to be in a slightly better situation, with only roughly 40% of its revenues depending on oil and the breakeven oil price being lower than that of Saudi Arabia. Russia will have to drawdown from its reserves as the current price levels would mean that they would have to absorb losses in production. Production costs might be in favour of Saudi Arabia, but what seems to not be in their favour is their high dependence on Oil. Saudi Arabia’s break-even oil price is expected to be USD 91 per barrel , which is comfortably above three times the current price. Its ambitious diversification plans - Saudi Vision 2030, has already hit several interim roadblocks. With current expenditure required to keep the citizens happy, their ability to do capital expenditure to incubate budding non-oil industries would be severely constrained. Despite having large financial buffers, the amount of drawdown will be unsustainable for Saudi Arabia. To put things in context, Russia would need to draw approximately USD 20 billion a year from the fund to balance the budget, whereas Saudi Arabia had already projected a deficit of roughly USD 50 billion before prices went tumbling. Lower prices would bring their deficit to three figures. The Saudi government has already proposed a cut in expenditure for the fiscal year 2020/21 citing unfavourable economic conditions and has asked several departments to formulate a plan to cut down their expenses by 20-30%. The U.S. Shale industry has been under profitability pressure and high debt levels. Lower oil prices would likely push them out of business. However, they have been able to navigate the previous low oil price levels witnessed in 2014-15. Therefore, things are not clear whether the price war would have a material impact on U.S. shale in the long term. Typically, low oil prices are a positive sign for oil importers. But in the current scenario where global manufacturing activity is close to a halt, the windfall from low prices could be considered only as a minor respite rather than a major advantage considering their stressed fiscal positions. Less wealthier nations of OPEC are also severely affected as their production capacity is not high enough to reap benefits from increased production while their economies are fragile enough to collapse if low prices become a norm. Overall, there are no clear winners in the price war, especially with a pandemic still spreading across the world.

Saudi Arabia and Russia have picked a very inauspicious time to engage in an Oil price war. Cases like Nigeria, Angola, Mexico and Venezuela are examples of nations that have wasted the benefits of oil wealth due to mismanagement. For several years, GCC nations have used revenues from oil to constructively transform their economies and build sizeable wealth for drastic situations. With the world gradually moving away from oil, they need to focus on sustainably developing their non-oil sector. A price war would not be of help, putting several oil dependent economies under pressure. Maintaining an equilibrium in the oil markets is the best way forward for everyone involved, especially in such testing times.

		<Title>[:en]Parallels between COVID-19 and global financial crisis[:ar]أوجه التشابه بين كوفيد-19 والأزمة المالية العالمية[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]Markets worldwide have experienced unprecedented volatility in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. Though the mortality rates of those affected is much lower than that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Coronavirus disease – 2019 (COVID-19) being highly contagious has spread to over 190 countries and resulted in over thirty thousand deaths, majorly in Italy, Spain and China . Considering the severity of the outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a ‘pandemic’.

Similar to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in 2008, state authorities have announced a slew of policy measures including aggressive fiscal measures and have launched necessary actions like lockdowns and curfews to slow down the contagion, put an end to the outbreak and to minimize the economic impact.

The way the current crisis is evolving is very similar to the GFC in many ways:
<h3>Failure to separate the good from the bad</h3>
The carriers of the virus may not exhibit any symptoms (asymptomatic) yet could infect or transmit the virus to other. The inability to detect the virus carriers at an early stage makes it impossible to contain the outbreak unless large swathes of the population quarantine themselves for a long period. Similarly, subprime mortgages (not-so-healthy credit) were packed along with better quality mortgages (healthy credit) through securitization process and were sold to investors. Backed by rating agencies who underwrote the credit quality, they spread across investors including large financial institutions. Inability to detect them early and failure to quarantine them eventually led to freezing up of banking and credit channels leading to global financial crisis in 2008.
<h3>It is okay, until it is NOT</h3>
In 2008, it was widely believed that the real estate prices would never fall. Analysts relied on historical real estate price behaviour to extrapolate further rise on an incremental basis. This view was reinforced by the actions of rating agencies that continued to underestimate the risk attached to Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs) and Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs). On similar lines, when the initial news of the virus broke analysts tried to model the outcome based on SARS, MERS and other infectious diseases and underestimated its potential impact. The very fact that COVID-19 had a low mortality rate than the others has led to a much faster spread of the disease as asymptomatic people unwittingly spread it to others before they were diagnosed. Meanwhile, the world itself is much more globalised and integrated now in 2020. As a result, the world is experiencing an unprecedented crisis as the virus has spread to most countries and the number of infections continues to rise unabated.
<h3>Rejection, Realisation, Reaction</h3>
During both the instances, the actors involved underplayed and largely ignored the early warnings. In 2008, policy makers played down the gravity of the situation and only acted when the financial system was on the brink of collapse. Now, China had silenced the whistle blower and denied the contagiousness of the virus till the end of January. Other countries in the west like US, UK and others also did not take drastic measures like lockdowns until it was too late. As a result, many governments worldwide are only now imposing strict testing and containment measures and advocating social distancing as a way to tackle the coronavirus crisis.
<h3>Local to Global</h3>
In 2008, the global financial crisis was perceived to be a problem pertaining to the mortgage segment in the U.S real estate. However, in a span of weeks the crisis spread and engulfed the global banking and financial sector and eventually the wider economy was also affected causing immense economic pain and damage. Likewise, initially COVID-19 was thought to be a problem within a Chinese province or at best an Asian problem. Many thought it would be regionally contained like the SARS/MERS. As it has now spread globally, the ramifications are being felt globally. The major western countries have basically halted their economy to stop the spread of the virus, causing great economic pain just like in 2008.
<h3>Will the COVID recovery be the same as the GFC?</h3>
The global economy recovered from the GFC by Q3 of 2009 as the US and other major western economies came out of the recession. However, it took nearly 10 years for many western countries to reach the unemployment levels to pre-crisis levels. This time too, a long road to recovery lies ahead, only it looks much worse. The 2008 GFC was primarily a financial crisis which was addressed by bailouts by governments and central bank actions like lowering interest rates and Quantitative easing. The real economy was mostly intact as factories, offices and restaurants were still open and once the banks started lending again, consumer demand started picking up and the economy made its slow road to recovery.
This time however, we have a massive public health crisis which has led to a voluntary shut down of the entire economy. No amount of central action will restart demand unless the disease is contained in a significant way. Even the trillions of dollars in stimulus packages announced by governments can allow people and businesses to just survive for the moment. Many of the shuttered small businesses might never open again. Already we can observe the effects. On March 21, 2020 unemployment claims in the US shot up to 3.3 million. Two weeks earlier that number stood at 211,000. Such a dramatic plunge in economic activity is simply unprecedented and makes the current situation more akin to the great depression of 1929 than even the GFC. Reopening the economy prematurely can worsen the health crisis. Until a cure is found, governments have to make tough decisions on how long the social distancing measures are going to continue. To conclude, while there are similarities in the way both the crisis have evolved, a lasting cure for the economic crisis caused by Covid-19 is going to come from scientists and researchers who can find a cure or a vaccine. Until then, policymakers can only hope to contain and mitigate the economic impact to as little as possible.

		<Title>[:en]The importance of Circuit Breakers in curbing volatility[:ar]أهمية الضوابط في كبح التقلبات[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]Stock markets around the world and the GCC have responded to the <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #005596;" href="https://www.marmoremena.com/research-reports/special-reports/coronavirus/">COVID-19 pandemic</a></span> with massive volatility, as traders have been panic selling out of fear driving the indices down. The Boursa Kuwait All Share Index (BKAT) saw huge falls on March 8 and March 9 when the BKAT fell 9.1% and 9.4% respectively due to the oil price crash and coronavirus fears. Due to this, Boursa Kuwait has announced that from March 15, the security circuit breaker would be modified by reducing the lower limit from 10 percent to 5 percent while maintaining the upper limit at 10 percent. If the Kuwaiti indices fall by 5% (previously 10%), trading would be halted for 15 minutes after which trading would resume. <a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/boursa-kuwait-adopts-ftse-russel-industry-classification-benchmark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boursa Kuwait</a> had introduced the original circuit breaker limits in 2018 as a part of wider reforms to the Kuwaiti capital markets. Elsewhere in the GCC, the Abu Dhabi and Dubai Stock exchanges also reduced the circuit breaker lower limit to 5%. The table below lists the circuit breaker limits currently in place in the GCC stock exchanges.

<strong>Exhibit: Circuit Breaker limits in GCC Stock Exchanges</strong>

<h3><strong>Black Monday of 1987 leads to the birth of circuit breakers</strong></h3>
Now, ‘Circuit breakers’ or ‘Trading Curbs’ have been used by stock exchanges around the world since ‘Black Monday’ on October 1987 when the Dow Jones Industrial Average crashed by 23% in a single trading session causing huge losses to investors. In this case, the selling was accelerated due to technical reasons related to the markets like lack of uniform margin trading rules. The circuit breaker tries to prevent this situation. By halting trading for a designated time after a huge fall, traders would get more time to wait for new information, both technical and fundamental, and reconsider their trades when trading resumes. This would prevent the kind of massive falls like that of Black Monday and have since been adopted by almost every stock exchange in the world.

<a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/equity-market-return-expectations-for-saudi-arabian-tasi-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3910" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CME_1200x150-1024x128.jpg" alt="Equity Market Return Expectations for Saudi Arabian TASI Index, 2020-2024" width="840" height="105" /></a>

While the circuit breaker equally applies when the market rises too fast, it is clear that it primarily exists to prevent huge falls. And there has been criticism from some market participants that circuit breakers were created for political reasons rather than practical. They say that market sell offs leading to losses are covered widely in the media while stock market rises driven by speculation are rarely seen as a concern. This creates an environment of loss aversion and the desire is to prevent losses as much as possible. These market players argue that halting trading through circuit breakers is mainly to stop short sellers, who seek to profit when the market goes down. Short selling is generally looked down upon by investors and politicians alike because they are seen as trying to profit from a bad situation. Also, in some cases like in Saudi Arabia stock market crash of 2006, circuit breaker limits failed to reduce the volatility as the reduced limits of 5% forced traders to enter large sell orders as the limit was approaching. Once the trading resumed, the selling continued unabated as the market continued to crash. Despite this instance, the view from most is that circuit breakers are necessary to curb volatility and protect investors. Also, most GCC stock exchanges have introduced reforms to the stock markets and they are much more regulated and efficient than the Saudi Stock market in 2006.
<h3><strong> </strong><strong>Calls for shutting down markets entirely are misguided</strong></h3>
Increasingly, there have been calls by some in the financial and political world that stock markets should be closed for weeks, perhaps months till the coronavirus situation stabilizes. While a short pause in trading triggered by circuit breakers are useful, a total shutdown of the markets in the GCC can cause real harm. Closing financial markets increase the risk of a total meltdown once they reopen and the coronavirus concerns persist even during the closure. By staying open and continuing trading, financial markets can send signals to the governments about the efficacy of fiscal and monetary stimulus policies. For example, global markets fell when a stimulus bill was not passed initially in the US Senate. When a package was finally passed, markets the world over rallied and the signal from the markets would likely have hastened the deal. Similarly the GCC governments and central banks have announced fiscal and monetary stimulus measures since March 9 when the GCC markets fell massively. These announcements have arrested the fall and small gains have been made in GCC stock markets too as the month draws to a close. To conclude, while modification to circuit breakers are a good step, the continued functioning of the stock exchanges is necessary for the long term benefit of GCC investors, governments and other stake holders.

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B0E9QEpuFrY" width="600" height="340" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>[:ar]Stock markets around the world and the GCC have responded to the <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #005596;" href="https://www.marmoremena.com/research-reports/special-reports/coronavirus/">COVID-19 pandemic</a></span> with massive volatility, as traders have been panic selling out of fear driving the indices down. The Boursa Kuwait All Share Index (BKAT) saw huge falls on March 8 and March 9 when the BKAT fell 9.1% and 9.4% respectively due to the oil price crash and coronavirus fears. Due to this, Boursa Kuwait has announced that from March 15, the security circuit breaker would be modified by reducing the lower limit from 10 percent to 5 percent while maintaining the upper limit at 10 percent. If the Kuwaiti indices fall by 5% (previously 10%), trading would be halted for 15 minutes after which trading would resume. <a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/boursa-kuwait-adopts-ftse-russel-industry-classification-benchmark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boursa Kuwait</a> had introduced the original circuit breaker limits in 2018 as a part of wider reforms to the Kuwaiti capital markets. Elsewhere in the GCC, the Abu Dhabi and Dubai Stock exchanges also reduced the circuit breaker lower limit to 5%. The table below lists the circuit breaker limits currently in place in the GCC stock exchanges.

<h3><strong>Black Monday of 1987 leads to the birth of circuit breakers</strong></h3>
Now, ‘Circuit breakers’ or ‘Trading Curbs’ have been used by stock exchanges around the world since ‘Black Monday’ on October 1987 when the Dow Jones Industrial Average crashed by 23% in a single trading session causing huge losses to investors. In this case, the selling was accelerated due to technical reasons related to the markets like lack of uniform margin trading rules. The circuit breaker tries to prevent this situation. By halting trading for a designated time after a huge fall, traders would get more time to wait for new information, both technical and fundamental, and reconsider their trades when trading resumes. This would prevent the kind of massive falls like that of Black Monday and have since been adopted by almost every stock exchange in the world.

<a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/equity-market-return-expectations-for-saudi-arabian-tasi-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3910" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CME_1200x150-1024x128.jpg" alt="Equity Market Return Expectations for Saudi Arabian TASI Index, 2020-2024" width="840" height="105" /></a>

While the circuit breaker equally applies when the market rises too fast, it is clear that it primarily exists to prevent huge falls. And there has been criticism from some market participants that circuit breakers were created for political reasons rather than practical. They say that market sell offs leading to losses are covered widely in the media while stock market rises driven by speculation are rarely seen as a concern. This creates an environment of loss aversion and the desire is to prevent losses as much as possible. These market players argue that halting trading through circuit breakers is mainly to stop short sellers, who seek to profit when the market goes down. Short selling is generally looked down upon by investors and politicians alike because they are seen as trying to profit from a bad situation. Also, in some cases like in Saudi Arabia stock market crash of 2006, circuit breaker limits failed to reduce the volatility as the reduced limits of 5% forced traders to enter large sell orders as the limit was approaching. Once the trading resumed, the selling continued unabated as the market continued to crash. Despite this instance, the view from most is that circuit breakers are necessary to curb volatility and protect investors. Also, most GCC stock exchanges have introduced reforms to the stock markets and they are much more regulated and efficient than the Saudi Stock market in 2006.
<h3><strong> </strong><strong>Calls for shutting down markets entirely are misguided</strong></h3>
Increasingly, there have been calls by some in the financial and political world that stock markets should be closed for weeks, perhaps months till the coronavirus situation stabilizes. While a short pause in trading triggered by circuit breakers are useful, a total shutdown of the markets in the GCC can cause real harm. Closing financial markets increase the risk of a total meltdown once they reopen and the coronavirus concerns persist even during the closure. By staying open and continuing trading, financial markets can send signals to the governments about the efficacy of fiscal and monetary stimulus policies. For example, global markets fell when a stimulus bill was not passed initially in the US Senate. When a package was finally passed, markets the world over rallied and the signal from the markets would likely have hastened the deal. Similarly the GCC governments and central banks have announced fiscal and monetary stimulus measures since March 9 when the GCC markets fell massively. These announcements have arrested the fall and small gains have been made in GCC stock markets too as the month draws to a close. To conclude, while modification to circuit breakers are a good step, the continued functioning of the stock exchanges is necessary for the long term benefit of GCC investors, governments and other stake holders.

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/research-reports/special-reports/coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #005596;">The Coronavirus</span></a> has spread across the <a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/research-reports/country/GCC/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GCC countries</a>, besides its immediate impact on the public health and the well-being of the residents and citizens, the outbreak will likely have significant economic consequences across the region. As the key economic activities in the region’s critical non-oil sectors like <a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/gcc-tourism-and-hospitality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tourism</a>, transportation is curtailed, we can expect a greater macroeconomic implication. In response to the crisis, the gulf region has introduced number of new economic measures to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus and help stabilize the region’s economy. At present, the policy responses primarily aim to support the individuals, businesses and sectors that will have profound impact from the downturn caused by the pandemic.
<h3><strong> </strong>Fiscal Stimulus to offset the economic fallout</h3>
The gulf countries have announced financial stimulus packages of billions of dollars to revitalize the impact caused by the COVID 19 on the economy. The stimulus will enhance liquidity and help cushion the blow on the GCC economy and businesses. The hefty stimulus programmes will provide direct benefits to individuals, corporations, businesses and industries amid the ongoing coronavirus crisis. <a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/research-reports/country/united-arab-emirates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #005596;">UAE</span></a> announced an economic stimulus package of 126 billion dirhams (USD 34.3 billion), Abu Dhabi, the largest emirate, unveiled a AED 9 billion (USD 2.4 billion) stimulus package. The emirate’s accelerator programme, Ghadan 21 is expanded to include 16-point plan that includes fee exemptions, fine waivers, SME support, and AED 1 billion allocated to establish market makers fund. Similarly, Dubai rolled out a AED 1.5 billion economic stimulus package which includes a 15 point plan.

In case of <a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/research-reports/country/kuwait/"><span style="color: #005596;">Kuwait</span></a>, the cabinet approved a bill to increase the budget of ministries and governmental departments by KD 500 million (USD1.6 billion) for the 2020/21 fiscal year. The country has also established a fund that will allow contributions from companies, individuals and institutions; the Central Bank of Kuwait initiated a KD 10 million fund to support the economy.

<h3>Budget cuts</h3>
As the present economic conditions can increase the fiscal stress in the region, some of the gulf countries have declared cut back on their spending. Oman reduced its budget for civil, military and security agencies by 5% for the year 2020. Saudi Arabia’s budgeted spend will be cut by SAR 50 billion (USD 13.32 billion), that corresponds to 5% of the budget, in areas with least social and economic impact. As the pandemic will likely impose strain on the countries’ budget, spending cut will be a key policy action to help ease pressure and balance the budget.
<h3>Reducing risks in the financial system</h3>
Central banks across the GCC have rolled out support schemes to reduce the risks in the banking system. Initiatives are undertaken to maintain the market confidence and stability in the financial system.  The central bank measures aims to ease the financial conditions, provide liquidity to the markets and support vulnerable sectors like SMEs. The Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) has announced a package of SAR 50 billion (USD 13.32 billion), to support the banking sector, financial institutions and SMEs. The Central Bank of UAE (CBUAE) has issued a support package of USD 34 billion. The stimulus will allow banks to provide relief for its retail and corporate customers from interest and principal repayments. To boost lending, the central bank allow banks to free up their regulatory capital buffers. It has also revised the real estate Loan to Value ratios and reduced the capital that banks must hold against loans to SMEs.

The Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK) will provide liquidity to commercial banks; the Kuwaiti banks have suspended the charges and commissions levied on POS, ATM and online banking transactions and extended collection of due payments. Oman's central bank provides OMR 8 billion (USD 20.8 billion) as extra liquidity to banks.  The Omani banks have also cut banking fees, adjusted capital and credit ratios, and allows repayment postponements for up to six months. On a similar move, the Qatar central bank suspended the charges and fees levied for POS and ATM transaction and delayed loan installments.
<h3>Rate cuts</h3>
The GCC banks have lowered the interest rates to support the market functioning during the pandemic crisis. The UAE central bank reduced its interest rate on one-week certificates of deposit by 75 basis points.  Saudi Arabia’s SAMA cut repo and reverse repo rates by 75 bps, while Kuwait’s central bank cut its deposit rate by 100 bps (1 per cent) to 1.5 per cent, its lowest ever. The Central Bank of Qatar reduced its deposits, lending, and repo rates. Bahrain’s central bank has slashed its lending rate and cut overnight, weekly and monthly deposit rates.

The coronavirus pandemic has created high uncertainty across the world and in the region, the GCC banks and the government have taken unprecedented measures to ease the pressure on economies and to maintain economic and financial stability. The gulf economies are creating sufficient buffers to boost the resilience of the financial system in the region. Coordinated policy action by the GCC economies can help mitigate the multiple shocks caused by the pandemic. As the crisis unfolds, more economic and financial stimulus package could be flagged, targeted and timely policy response across the region can help address the adverse economic consequences due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]As the <a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/research-repository/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #3366ff;">COVID-19</span></a> pandemic continues to cast its shadow far and wide, businesses across sectors are likely to be negatively impacted. This has also reflected in equities, as stocks across sectors have taken a hit.

<strong>Exhibit: GCC Indices and their YTD (in %)</strong>
<img class="alignleft wp-image-3859 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GCC-Indices-and-their-YTD_Marmore-Article_Exhibit1.jpg" alt="GCC Indices and their YTD (in %)" width="679" height="337" />
<span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #696969; font-size: 10px;">Source: Refinitiv; Note: Data as of 25th Mar 2020. Cyclicals includes Hospitality, Tourism; Basic Materials includes Construction; Industrials includes Aviation, Logistics.</span>

While initial concerns were of a spill over effect from China, the virus’ spread across regions, including GCC, has caused both demand and supply side shocks. As the contagion continues to spread, the actual impact on sectors and economies would depend on its duration and intensity.

Based on the developments so far, the following sectors are likely to be most affected in GCC.
<h3><a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/research-reports/industry/real-estate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Real Estate and Construction</a></h3>
Decreased demand in real estate would affect the sector in the near term. In countries like UAE, where oversupply had been a concern before the virus outbreak, the impact might be compounded. However once the virus threat abates, the residential sector might recover sooner aided by government measures such as Abu Dhabi’s waiver of real estate registration fees and low interest rate environment. The downside for residential real estate is the unemployment trends that may prop up if the virus persists.

Social Distancing and lockdowns have caused closure of malls, offices and other commercial spaces. Many landlords are giving tenants the option of delaying rent payments. There is a call for rent freeze from commercial tenants. These measures might weigh on landlords’ revenues and erode credit quality. Trends sparked by COVID-19 like work from home at scale and increased online shopping might impact demand for office and retail spaces in the long run.

From availability of construction materials to labour shortages and work stoppage to contain coronavirus spread, construction sector is being struck from multiple angles.
<h3><a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/research-reports/industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Energy</a></h3>
Hit by the double whammy of lower demand due to virus outbreak and oil price war, the energy industry is one of the most affected sectors. Energy was also one of the earliest sectors to be impacted. Even when the outbreak was limited to China, with it being the largest importer of oil, demand was expected to fall and oil prices started declining. The demand is expected to fall by about 15-20 million barrels per day in the next few weeks(Estimates by Goldman Sachs, Vitol and IEA). The uncertainty in outlook because of virus’ spread and historically low prices have led to oil majors across the world slashing their expenditure budget.
<h3><a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/research-reports/industry/hospitality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Travel and Tourism</a></h3>
One of the first measures taken by countries to contain the spread was to impose travel restrictions. This has hurt aviation and hospitality industry at its core. In airlines and hospitality, time is an important component in service delivery. While in goods, higher demand at a later might compensate for current decrease, it is not the case in service based sectors. Demand once lost is an opportunity gone by.

In the week from 9th -16th March 2020, airlines in Saudi Arabia and UAE had reduced capacity by 15.3%(<a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Capitalist</a>). International Air Transport Association has projected that airlines in the middle east are facing a 2020 revenue loss of USD 19 billion, with the revenue loss around the word estimated at USD 252 billion. CAPA Centre for Aviation has estimated that most airlines globally will be bankrupt by the end of May without coordinated government and industry action. Airlines are reportedly taking measures such as salary cuts and cancelling or postponing 2019 dividends.

Cancellation and postponement of events have cemented the decrease in demand in hospitality. Travel restrictions have led to free fall in occupancy rates and in turn revenues. Hotels are reportedly closing bookings to tide over these tough times. The magnitude of impact is still a question with expectations of it being on the higher side.
<h3><a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/research-reports/industry/banking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Banking</a></h3>
As businesses across sectors face the heat, given their credit exposure to other sectors, banks would not remain unscathed. A host of factors from weakening credit profile of borrowers, probable increase in NPAs, lower interest rates in the near term to measures such as deferring loan repayments might affect bank’s profitability. Lower oil prices and potential slowdown in economic growth may slow down banks’ credit growth.
<h3><a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/research-reports/industry/healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Healthcare</a></h3>
Healthcare is the sector most intertwined with COVID-19. As the number of cases increase across countries, healthcare is swamped with COVID-19 patients in most countries. Outpatient departments are closed and planned surgeries have been postponed, leading to revenue loss for healthcare providers. Inadequacy of healthcare infrastructure - from basic protective gears to sophisticated equipment - is under spotlight as even developed countries with advanced health care systems struggle to cope with the crisis.
<h3><a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/research-reports/industry/education" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Education</a></h3>
With schools and universities asked to shut down, online learning has gained traction. From advanced apps to basic video platforms, education ecosystem is trying to make online learning work as seamlessly as possible. This might change the way the sector works in the long run. Education technology providers would stand to gain from this change. COVID-19 scare may be a deterrent for students to study abroad as it might affect perceptions of personal safety, reducing foreign student numbers at the institutions. However, as countries would take efforts to improve their health systems, this might not be a long term trend.

The suddenness and speed of the virus spread has added to the magnitude of the blow to businesses. While some are optimistic over pace of business revival once the COVID-19 scare passes, there is a downside risk that prolonged virus spread might push the world into recession. With the coronavirus curve flattening out in some countries, there is hope that this health crisis shall soon pass. Once it does, fiscal measures and favourable interest rates would provide adequate support structure as demand revives and sectors rebound.

This has also reflected in equities, as stocks across sectors have taken a hit.

While initial concerns were of a spill over effect from China, the virus’ spread across regions, including GCC, has caused both demand and supply side shocks. As the contagion continues to spread, the actual impact on sectors and economies would depend on its duration and intensity.

Based on the developments so far, the following sectors are likely to be most affected in GCC.
<h3><a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/research-reports/industry/real-estate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Real Estate and Construction</a></h3>
Decreased demand in real estate would affect the sector in the near term. In countries like UAE, where oversupply had been a concern before the virus outbreak, the impact might be compounded. However once the virus threat abates, the residential sector might recover sooner aided by government measures such as Abu Dhabi’s waiver of real estate registration fees and low interest rate environment. The downside for residential real estate is the unemployment trends that may prop up if the virus persists.

Social Distancing and lockdowns have caused closure of malls, offices and other commercial spaces. Many landlords are giving tenants the option of delaying rent payments. There is a call for rent freeze from commercial tenants. These measures might weigh on landlords’ revenues and erode credit quality. Trends sparked by COVID-19 like work from home at scale and increased online shopping might impact demand for office and retail spaces in the long run.

From availability of construction materials to labour shortages and work stoppage to contain coronavirus spread, construction sector is being struck from multiple angles.
<h3><a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/research-reports/industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Energy</a></h3>
Hit by the double whammy of lower demand due to virus outbreak and oil price war, the energy industry is one of the most affected sectors. Energy was also one of the earliest sectors to be impacted. Even when the outbreak was limited to China, with it being the largest importer of oil, demand was expected to fall and oil prices started declining. The demand is expected to fall by about 15-20 million barrels per day in the next few weeks(Estimates by Goldman Sachs, Vitol and IEA). The uncertainty in outlook because of virus’ spread and historically low prices have led to oil majors across the world slashing their expenditure budget.
<h3><a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/research-reports/industry/hospitality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Travel and Tourism</a></h3>
One of the first measures taken by countries to contain the spread was to impose travel restrictions. This has hurt aviation and hospitality industry at its core. In airlines and hospitality, time is an important component in service delivery. While in goods, higher demand at a later might compensate for current decrease, it is not the case in service based sectors. Demand once lost is an opportunity gone by.

In the week from 9th -16th March 2020, airlines in Saudi Arabia and UAE had reduced capacity by 15.3%(<a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Capitalist</a>). International Air Transport Association has projected that airlines in the middle east are facing a 2020 revenue loss of USD 19 billion, with the revenue loss around the word estimated at USD 252 billion. CAPA Centre for Aviation has estimated that most airlines globally will be bankrupt by the end of May without coordinated government and industry action. Airlines are reportedly taking measures such as salary cuts and cancelling or postponing 2019 dividends.

Cancellation and postponement of events have cemented the decrease in demand in hospitality. Travel restrictions have led to free fall in occupancy rates and in turn revenues. Hotels are reportedly closing bookings to tide over these tough times. The magnitude of impact is still a question with expectations of it being on the higher side.
<h3><a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/research-reports/industry/banking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Banking</a></h3>
As businesses across sectors face the heat, given their credit exposure to other sectors, banks would not remain unscathed. A host of factors from weakening credit profile of borrowers, probable increase in NPAs, lower interest rates in the near term to measures such as deferring loan repayments might affect bank’s profitability. Lower oil prices and potential slowdown in economic growth may slow down banks’ credit growth.
<h3><a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/research-reports/industry/healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Healthcare</a></h3>
Healthcare is the sector most intertwined with COVID-19. As the number of cases increase across countries, healthcare is swamped with COVID-19 patients in most countries. Outpatient departments are closed and planned surgeries have been postponed, leading to revenue loss for healthcare providers. Inadequacy of healthcare infrastructure - from basic protective gears to sophisticated equipment - is under spotlight as even developed countries with advanced health care systems struggle to cope with the crisis.
<h3><a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/research-reports/industry/education" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Education</a></h3>
With schools and universities asked to shut down, online learning has gained traction. From advanced apps to basic video platforms, education ecosystem is trying to make online learning work as seamlessly as possible. This might change the way the sector works in the long run. Education technology providers would stand to gain from this change. COVID-19 scare may be a deterrent for students to study abroad as it might affect perceptions of personal safety, reducing foreign student numbers at the institutions. However, as countries would take efforts to improve their health systems, this might not be a long term trend.

The suddenness and speed of the virus spread has added to the magnitude of the blow to businesses. While some are optimistic over pace of business revival once the COVID-19 scare passes, there is a downside risk that prolonged virus spread might push the world into recession. With the coronavirus curve flattening out in some countries, there is hope that this health crisis shall soon pass. Once it does, fiscal measures and favourable interest rates would provide adequate support structure as demand revives and sectors rebound.

		<Title>[:en]In the COVID-19 crisis, who are the few global winners amidst plenty of losers?[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]The COVID-19 outbreak in China and its spread to almost all countries of the world has profoundly affected the global economy and businesses. Many sectors of the economy have come to a complete halt and others are operating at greatly reduced capacity. This has been reflected in the stock markets around the world which have fallen hugely in a short span of time. Amidst this sea of gloom, there have been certain companies who have emerged unscathed and may be even better off than before the crisis.

<strong>Companies providing essential services during the lockdown have benefited</strong>
While COVID-19 has impacted many industries and institutions, certain sectors of the economy have been hit particularly hard. Schools, Colleges, Cinemas and Offices were among the first to be closed after stay-at-home orders were imposed by many governments. As a result, companies that provide or enable a substitute service offered by these sectors have benefited from this crisis. A well-known example has been Zoom, a company that provides videoconferencing services which has been used from schools to offices to government cabinet meetings. This has been reflected in its share price which has nearly doubled since the beginning of the year. Citrix Systems, a company known for its VPN software used for working from home by 400,000 organisations has also been one of the biggest gainers in the S&P 500.

While the above two companies are examples of previously lesser known companies doing very well during this crisis, a known market favourite has continued to do well. With so many people stuck at home, Netflix - the world leader in streaming entertainment, has been a big winner. It has seen new subscriptions surge since March and has seen its share price increase 15% for the year in spite of competition from big players like Disney and Comcast.

<strong>Diversification helps</strong>
All the above mentioned companies need the services of cloud computing software and the market leaders in cloud computing like Amazon and Microsoft have outperformed the market. Both of them are also tech companies with diversified offerings and so have been able to lessen the impact of COVID-19. Microsoft’s Teams application competes with Zoom in providing videoconferencing services and has seen its usage soar in recent weeks. Amazon has benefited from e-commerce being declared an essential service in many countries and has seen a y-o-y increase of 35% in e-commerce sales in March. Walmart Inc., another company that has made big investments in e-commerce and with its leading position in grocery sales has also benefited from the crisis. Meanwhile non-grocery brick-and-mortar retailers have been forced to shut down their outlets and have seen their sales basically vanish overnight.

<strong>Winners in the Health care industry</strong>
1. Companies focussed on developing a covid-19 vaccine
Since the economic crisis was triggered by a global health crisis in the first place, the healthcare sector is poised to benefit from the increased spending on vaccine development and treatment of COVID-19 patients. Companies that are in advanced stages of developing a vaccine to COVID-19 like Gilead, Inovio and Regeneron have seen their share prices soar in the past one month. In fact, the whole Bio-tech and Pharma industry is seen to benefit from the increased healthcare spending likely to happen in a post-covid world.

2. Companies that make PPE and ventilators
Then, there are the companies which produce personal protective equipment (PPE) that is being used by healthcare workers and instruments like ventilators, the machine that helps severely ill covid-19 patients to breathe and for which there is a serious shortage at the global level. Conglomerates 3M, Honeywell and DuPont are leading manufacturers of PPE and expected to capitalise on the increased demand in the coming months. The leading players in the previously niche segment of Ventilator Production include conglomerates like Philips and GE Healthcare and specialist manufacturers like Dragerwerk, Medtronic, Hamilton Medical etc. Dragerwerk listed in Germany, has seen its share price rise 50% YTD. All companies are racing to ramp up their production to keep up with the rising demand for ventilators as the disease spreads and more and more people are hospitalised.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>
The covid-19 crisis has caused a severe disruption to the economy and many sectors are struggling. However, the crisis has greatly benefited certain companies and sectors. A common feature of many is their online presence that enables continuation of services even during lockdown periods. The other group is companies in the Healthcare sector who are naturally in demand during a health crisis. The question that arises is will these companies sustain their success once the economy returns to a semblance of normalcy. Right now though, they are the few winners amidst plenty of losers.[:]]]></Content>

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]The economic repercussions of the impact of novel Coronavirus and the subsequent breakdown of OPEC+ supply cut agreement is unprecedented for the gulf economies. The sudden freeze in economic activity due to various measures such as travel restrictions (curbs on flights, public transportations and taxis), closing of schools, universities, shopping malls, commercials establishments, and curfew imposition to prevent the spread of virus has created a demand shock. Transportation sector that accounts for approx. 50 percent of global oil demand by end-use category has been impacted by such measures that have been implemented in various degrees across countries. Subsequently, oil markets faced with excess supply, and reduced demand has tumbled to historic low price levels.
<blockquote>As a result, the outlook for GCC economies that majorly rely on petrodollars has deteriorated at a rapid pace. IMF in its latest report has reduced the overall growth expectations for the GCC region by 520 basis points; it now expects the economy to contract by 2.7 percent from an earlier value of 2.5 percent growth for 2020. To assuage the economic impact, the extent of which is currently unknown, GCC countries have unveiled various fiscal and monetary measures. The fiscal measures presently amount to approx. USD 60 billion.</blockquote>

On expectations of lower fiscal revenues, GCC governments has revised their budgets, cut down on non-essential spending and scaled back capital expenditures in various degrees. Saudi Arabia has stated that it would reduce spending by SAR 50 billion (USD 13.3 billion or 2 percent of its GDP) in non-priority areas of 2020 budget. Dubai government is set to reduce capital spending by atleast 50 percent. While, Qatar is set to postpone awarding of USD 8.2 billion worth of project contracts on account of coronavirus outbreak. Similarly, Bahrain has announced that it would reduce non-priority government agencies expenditure by 30 percent, Oman authorities have announced that they will reduce their spending by 10 percent in 2020 (5 percent of GDP) and halt new capital outlays (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>).

Further, due to lower oil income receipts and increasing expenditures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, the fiscal deficit for the GCC countries is expected to widen from 2.1 percent of GDP to 10.4 percent of GDP. In terms of value, the deficit that stood at USD 34 billion for 2019 is expected to be at USD 143 billion for 2020, a rise of 320 percent (<a href="https://www.imf.org/external/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IMF</a>).

To balance the deficits, the governments could either dip into their accumulated fiscal reserves or issue additional debt. As the interest rates are at record lows and with many GCC countries having low debt compared to their emerging market peers, it would be a prudent choice to tap international debt markets for capital. Whilst, Kuwait, UAE, KSA and Qatar command robust reserves and have low debt, could tide over the situation easily; Bahrain and Oman that do not have robust reserves similar to their GCC counterparts could witness pressure in consolidating their finances.

<strong>Figure: Debt levels of GCC countries are set to accelerate at record pace</strong>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-4502 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GCC-fiscal-deficits-and-financing-post-COVID-19_Marmore-Article_Fig3.jpg" alt="Figure: Debt levels of GCC countries are set to accelerate at record pace" width="492" height="400" />
<span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #696969; font-size: 10px;">Source: IMF; Data from April REO, 2020.</span>

Fitch ratings agency recently noted that the ability of Oman to issue additional debt is constrained and that it could come at a high cost. Fitch recently downgraded Oman to ‘BB’ from ‘BB+’ with a negative outlook that could push Oman further deep into the ‘junk’ territory. The report added, the financial position of Oman is precarious and that it could threaten its ability to maintain the currency peg.

Though Bahrain has higher debt level than Oman, GCC countries have pledged USD 10 billion of financial support to help it tide over the situation.

<strong><a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/gcc-sovereign-debt-issuances/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GCC Sovereign issuances</a> reach record high in April</strong>

In the start of April, Qatar issued USD 10 billion of debt in three tranches of five, ten and thirty years period. Due to its financial profile, it was able to receive orders worth up to USD 45 billion; however, the pricing was 40 basis points (bps) over its existing curve. Abu Dhabi – prime credit in the region, followed up with USD 7 billion of bonds in three tranches and it was able to garner orders for USD 44 billion at a pricing of 30bps over its existing curve.

Following the successful debt issuance, Saudi Arabia raised USD 7 billion in three tranches to bolster its finances. Saudi Arabia earlier in March raised its debt ceiling from 30 percent of GDP to 50 percent of GDP. It raised USD 2.5 billion in 5.5-year bonds at 260bps over U.S treasuries, USD 1.5 billion in 10.5-year bonds at 270bps over U.S treasuries and USD 3 billion in 40-year bonds at 4.55 percent. The 40-year bonds is the longest-dated issue in dollars by a gulf borrower (Reuters). It is be noted that Saudi Arabia raised USD 5 billion at the start of the year.

In the case of Kuwait, parliamentary authorization to issue or refinance debt expired in 2017. The government has not been able to secure approval for borrowing yet. Reserves in Future Generation Fund (FGF) that stand at approx. USD 468 billion (or 346 percent of 2019e GDP) cannot be used for funding without approval while General Reserve Fund (GRF) whose assets amount to USD 77 billion (57 percent of 2019e GDP) and are utilized to meet the financing needs of the government are depleting.

We expect GCC sovereigns to issue debt worth USD 67 billion in 2020 compared to USD 52.9 billion last year. However, last year USD 37.4 billion was raised in international debt market and the rest was issued domestically. For 2020, we expect the majority of issuances to be in international debt markets. This would be accompanied by USD 84 billion in drawdown from their reserves to cover the deficits in 2020 compared to drawdown of USD 15 billion last year (Fitch Ratings). Thus, the financing mix is expected to decisively shift towards reserve drawdown from debt issuance to cover the deficits.

Thus, the financing mix is expected to decisively shift towards reserve drawdown from debt issuance to cover the deficits.

		<Title>[:en]COVID-19’s direct and indirect impact on GCC banking sector[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]The Current economic crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to impact many sectors, none more so than Banking. The Banking sector will be directly impacted by lower profitability, increased non-performing loans (NPLs), deterioration in capital adequacy, etc. and also indirectly impacted by the effect of the various lockdowns and restrictions on the other sectors to which <b>GCC banks</b> are exposed which would impact their operations and profitability in the long run.

<strong>Direct Impact </strong><strong>due to <a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/gcc-coronavirus-dashboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">COVID-19</a></strong>
The operations of <b>GCC banks</b> have been hit due to limited branches operating and increased adoption of digital channels. The suspension of travel, hospitality, and leisure activities will see a decrease in credit card usage though increase in online purchases could make up for it to some extent. ATM usage is likely to go up as customers eschew bank visits. As mandated by regulators, GCC banks have waived processing fees and charges for certain transactions. Mortgage and personal financing will see a hit due to changing consumer behaviour during the lockdowns. Banks will need to review their existing processes and increase digitization and automation.

The direct financial impact will be a reduction in profitability due to lower Net Interest Margins (NIM) and higher provisioning for bad loans. The sizable cut in interest rates by all the GCC central banks since the start of the crisis will reduce NIMs since the gross yields earned on loans will decline more than the interest paid on deposits, and also the rate cut is unlikely to significantly increase credit volumes in the difficult environment right now. The sharp fall in oil prices and reduced activity due to COVID-19 will exert significant pressure on the real estate, trade, retail, transportation, and hospitality sectors. High provisioning for interest and loan exposures to several of these large business segments of the banks will result in losses for the banking sector which are likely to peak in the second quarter of 2020 and will also result in losses for the full year of 2020.

<strong>Indirect Impact due to exposure to vulnerable sectors</strong>
The GCC economy has been hit by the double whammy of low oil prices and the coronavirus which has led to the shutdown of much of the non-oil economy. <i>GCC Banks</i> have the highest exposure to the real estate sector which is hit by falling prices and rents as new capacity continues to be added to already over-supplied markets. The Share of Real estate loans out of the overall loan book is Kuwait (28%), Qatar (27%), and UAE (29%) banks. In the case of UAE, any disruption to Dubai Expo 2020 which is already postponed, would impact its banking sector. Many <b>GCC banks</b> are exposed to Dubai Expo 2020-related projects in infrastructure, real estate, and construction segments. UAE banks are also exposed to NMC Health Plc to the tune of USD 2 billion, though its troubles preceded the COVID-19 crisis. The closure of hotels and shopping malls has significantly impacted the hospitality and retail sector. Various GCC governments have announced relief packages like postponement of principal and interest payment for 3-6 months for these affected sectors. While these measures could provide short-term relief, they may simply delay the recognition of impaired loans and understate the real extent of problem loans. Cash-flow generation by corporates will slow down leading to loan restructuring in the coming quarters.

<strong>Capacity of GCC banks to absorb losses</strong>
Most GCC banking systems have adequate capital buffers to absorb unexpected losses compared to the Global Financial Crisis in 2008(refer table above). According to S&P Global Ratings, <i>GCC banks</i> could absorb up to a $36 billion in losses before starting to deplete their capital base. Loan Loss Provision Coverage Ratio (LLP) has also improved for GCC banks since 2008 with Kuwait Banks having a LLP of 230% for 2019. Further, the GCC central banks have acted swiftly and relaxed capital adequacy and liquidity requirements in anticipation of rising bad loans in the coming months. Most banking systems also benefit from a high to very high likelihood of government support if needed. The fall in Oil prices has impacted the extent of the government support which is possible and the respective sovereign credit rating. On this basis, Bahrain (rated BB- by Fitch) and Oman (rated BB by Fitch) are most vulnerable due to their below investment-grade sovereign credit ratings. Kuwait, UAE and Qatar are best placed due to their higher sovereign rating (rated AA by Fitch ratings).

<blockquote><strong>Conclusion</strong>
<a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/gcc-banking-sector-2018-7-factors-to-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The GCC banking sector</a> is expected to see significant operational and financial impacts directly as a result of lockdowns and indirectly due to the stress in the wider economy. On the operational front, this will result in adoption of digital channels which are likely to continue even after the crisis ends and change the face of banking. On the financial front, due to adequate capital buffers and the possibility of government support, the current crisis is expected to remain more of a profitability shock rather than a capital or solvency issue for GCC banks.</blockquote>

		<Title>[:en]GCC Governments should tap the idea of perpetual bonds[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]Spain proposed an interesting financing mechanism, though not unprecedented, to fund the recovery measures against COVID-19 pandemic impact by issuing bonds without maturity date. The bond, popularly known as ‘perpetual’, has no set date for redemption and the government pays coupon until it decides to buy the bond back. The idea resonated well among many as it could offer and easy and low-cost way to finance the proposed amount of EUR 1 trillion (USD 1.08 trillion).

Based on various estimates, the financing needs for the GCC governments are around USD 200billion. Raising the above capital could be done effectively and efficiently through issuance of ‘perpetual bonds’, on which the principal need not be paid. However, at the issuer’s discretion, the bonds could be purchased or redeemed. Sovereigns have issued perpetual bonds to finance wars, wherein the need to raise capital was massive. Perpetual bonds also known as ‘consols’ – short for consolidated annuities – were first issued in 1751 by Britain and by the U.S government in 1870s. In 1927, Winston Churchill issued perpetual bonds (consols) at 4percent coupon payment to refinance the war bonds that originated from the First World War. These bonds traded in London until 2015 when the government finally decided to redeem them. As GCC governments, wage a war on multiple fronts, healthcare sector to save lives, economic front to save jobs and livelihoods, and revenue front amid low oil prices; raising capital by perpetual bonds could be considered as a policy measure.

Perpetual bonds have certain advantages over others, which make them appropriate in the current circumstances. First, the principal need not be repaid in the case of perpetual bond, thus the burden on fiscal finances would be minimal compared to the alternative of regular tenured bonds. Being perpetual in nature, no amount of capital would need to be set aside for principal repayments nor would they ever come in due. The only outflow would be that of the interest payments. However, both the options would provide the same amount of capital for the government. Assuming that the financing need of USD 200billion could be achieved by floating a perpetual bond at 5percent yield or coupon rate, the governments would need to pay just USD 10billion or 0.6percent of their GDP, which is largely manageable.

Second, GCC governments have been carrying out various reforms on the equity and debt side to transform their capital markets in the recent years. Debt Management Office (DMO) was established in the GCC countries following the 2014-oil price fall to manage sovereign debt issuances. Issuing perpetual sovereign bonds could accelerate the progress and aid in the development of debt capital markets in the region. Government of Saudi Arabia raised USD 2.97billion with 40-year maturity, the longest tenor offered by a sovereign issue from GCC region, in April 2020 at a yield of 4.55 percent.

<strong>Recent perpetual issues by GCC banks</strong>

<span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #696969; font-size: 10px;">Source: Reuters, Marmore Research.</span>

Third, perpetual bonds are not new in the region with many of the banks being active issuers in the recent past to shore up their capital base. Sale of perpetual bonds by the regional banks gained

momentum following the successful issuance of USD 1billion perpetual sukuk by Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank in 2012. The sukuk was structured as a hybrid of common structures without any specific maturity date and was issued for raising tier-I capital, in accordance to the standards set Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Though a similar issue was successfully placed in 2009 among private investors, it was only in 2012 that a public sale was witnessed. Even non-financials firms such as Almarai (dairy company from Saudi Arabia) has issued perpetual bonds, in the past, to boost their capital without diluting equity stake.

To cushion the impact caused by the twin shock of COVID-19 and low oil prices, GCC governments need to act fast and consider massive measures to alleviate economic pain and steer it in the path of recovery. Financing government measures through perpetual bonds is the easiest way to do it without constraining the finances.

		<Title>[:en]Impact of Oil Price Volatility on GCC economies, markets and businesses[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]Closely intertwined with economic growth, oil has been vulnerable to global growth outlook. The recent collapse in oil prices caused by demand destruction on account of COVID -19 was exacerbated by the OPEC+ disagreement, pushing prices down to historically low levels. In the current dynamic scenario, where the world is controlled by COVID-19, while news on OPEC+ agreement, stimulus etc. causes some increase in prices, news on extension of lockdowns and filling up of oil storage causes a steep fall in oil prices. These movements have caused increased oil price volatility.
Oil price volatility is measured by the Oil Price Volatility Index(OVX) (The OVX or “Oil VIX,” measures the market’s expectation of 30-day volatility of crude oil prices based on options on the United States Oil Fund LP. USO is an exchange-traded fund intended to reflect, as closely as possible, the spot price of West Texas Intermediate light, sweet crude oil, less USO expenses). Though the OVX measures volatility in price changes in WTI, as both WTI and Brent crude are driven by similar market sentiments and follow similar trajectory, the volatility index is considered to represent volatility of oil in general.

<blockquote><a href="https://www.databook.marmoremena.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong> Did You Know? </strong> 
<span style="color: #800000;">

The oil volatility index reached a value of 325, its highest level since its inception in 2007 on 21st April 2020. This indicates oil price could swing in either direction by 20% in a day (Daily Volatility = Index Value/ Square root (365)). This spike was on the back of the WTI crude oil turning negative, as storage facilities neared their full capacity and producers paid buyers to take the oil off the facilities.
While there have been spikes in volatility during low oil price years of 2008 and 2014-16, the current spike has dwarfed them. Volatility is generally known to be higher when the market in the bear run, and the same has panned out in the oil markets too. Higher volatility signals higher riskiness of an asset and negative sentiments.

As nations where oil is a major source of revenue, these are more vulnerable to the volatility in oil prices. As coronavirus continues with no end in sight, in addition to lower oil prices, their uncertainty of their direction or magnitude of fall adds to the woes of GCC. We take look at the impact of oil price volatility on economies, markets and businesses.

<strong>GCC Economies</strong>
Citing lower oil prices and COVID-19, IMF has projected Gulf Cooperation Council’s growth to shrink 2.7% in 2020, compared with its October 2019’s forecast of 2.5% growth for the same period. As governments dole out stimulus to contain COVID-19 impact amidst lower oil prices, their borrowing needs would increase. Saudi Arabia has said its total debt could reach 220 billion riyals (USD 58 billion) in 2020. Given the expected economic contraction and increased borrowing, the government debt as percentage of GDP is expected to increase.

<strong>Table 2: April 2020 Forecasts for 2020 (Oil Price Assumption: USD 35.61 per barrel)</strong>
<img class="size-full wp-image-4548 aligncenter" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Impact-of-Oil-Price-Volatility-on-GCC_Marmore-Article-Fig3.jpg" alt="April 2020 Forecasts for 2020 " width="749" height="270" /><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #696969; font-size: 10px;">Source: IMF</span>

Given their dependence on oil, its volatility makes the outlook for the region uncertain and increases its perceived risk. This uncertainty affects many aspects of the GCC economies from economic growth prospects and fiscal policy to debt levels and sovereign rating.
To reduce their oil dependence, GCC countries try to increase their non-oil revenue and boost non-oil sector growth. Oil volatility makes this move difficult. Boosting non-oil sector growth requires higher investment in these sectors. Volatility in oil prices hinders the planning and execution of the projects in these sectors, as their implementation is usually over long time frame. Lower oil prices and the accompanying volatility, while highlighting the urgency of fiscal reforms like levying taxes and reducing subsidies, also restrict the room available for those reforms.
Oil price assumption is an important linchpin of GCC governments’ budget. Volatility makes the budgeting process uncertain. For example, budgeting assuming oil price at USD 50 per barrel is easier than assuming oil price to be in a range of USD 20 – 80 per barrel (CFR - Oil Volatility). It also destabilizes fiscal policy and the governments are caught unawares. Lower oil prices and stimulus to cushion COVID-19’s impact are increasing governments’ borrowing requirements. While countries like Saudi Arabia are issuing sovereign bonds, Kuwait has not been able to do so as it is yet to pass the public debt law.

While governments’ borrowing needs and debt levels increase, oil volatility would influence the risk perception of lending to these countries. Saudi Arabia’s 5-year credit default swap (CDS) spreads reaching 233 bps and rating downgrade of Kuwait by S&P are a few recent examples of this increased risk perception.

There has been volatility in the oil markets in the past and every time there has been a call for action. The current crisis only indicates the sheer magnitude to which volatility could spike and oil prices could fall, re-iterating the need for moving away from an oil-based economy.

<strong>GCC Markets</strong>
GCC capital markets are prone to oil price movements. In 2014-16 oil price crash, the S&P GCC index had dropped by about 43% when the volatility index had peaked. In the current volatility spike, the markets have dropped by 23%. The 3-year correlation between monthly returns of sector index and oil price is significant for almost all sectors other than healthcare, telecom and non-cyclicals.
<strong>Table 3: Correlation between Sector Index and Oil Price Monthly Returns</strong>
<img class="size-full wp-image-4548 aligncenter" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Impact-of-Oil-Price-Volatility-on-GCC_Marmore-Article-Fig4.jpg" alt="Correlation between Sector Index and Oil Price Monthly Returns" width="749" height="270" /><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #696969; font-size: 10px;">Source: Refinitiv, Marmore Research;</span>

<strong>GCC Businesses</strong>
From oil majors to petrochemical industry to banking, oil volatility affects businesses across sectors. As an indicator of risk, high oil volatility prompts a conservative and cautious approach. Oil majors are affected because of uncertainty in their revenue streams. This causes them to reduce operating costs and capital expenditure. An example would be Kuwait Petroleum Corporation and Saudi Aramco’s announcement of spending cuts in the face of recent volatility. GCC Petrochemicals focus on basic petrochemicals and are highly correlated with oil prices (PwC). Hence oil price volatility would impact GCC petrochemicals too in terms of uncertain revenue streams. In addition to spending cuts, uncertainty in revenue arising from oil volatility would affect debt repayments, raising new debt and makes capital structure choices difficult.

As government spending on non-oil sector reduces, their growth would also be stunted. This would affect sectors like construction and real estate as their demand decreases. As businesses reduce spending and cut down on investment and expansion plans, banks’ credit growth would also be affected. As companies see decrease in revenues, banks’ provisioning might also increase in anticipation of deterioration in asset quality.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>
Be it the Global Financial Crisis, slowdown in global growth, trade wars or COVID-19, oil is one of the first commodities to take a hit. Given the uncertainty of these events, it seems like volatility of oil is here to stay. Measures such as taxation, subsidy reduction and boost to non-oil growth would help GCC move away from oil-based economy. But until GCC moves considerably towards a non-oil economy, in addition to oil price levels, given the recent sharp movements, its volatile nature might make its own place in decision making.[:]]]></Content>

		<Title>[:en]How to improve the Secondary Market for Sukuk Bonds[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]This article was first published in <a href="https://www.islamicfinancenews.com/how-to-improve-the-secondary-market-for-sukuk.html?access-key=5ef698cd9fe650923ea331c15af3b160">Islamic Finance news Volume 17 Issue 22</a> dated the 3rd June 2020

Sukuk bonds have been gaining in popularity since their first issuance in 1990. According to the International Islamic Financial market (IIFM), Global Sukuk Issuances with maturity over 18 months totalled USD 42 billion in 2019, a growth of 6% over 2018 and nearly 40% over 2009. However, in-spite of the rise in issuances, the secondary market for Sukuk Bonds has remained illiquid with most of the bonds held to maturity. One reason is many Sukuk by law are subject to trading restrictions like Salam Sukuk which is tradable at par-value only.  However, there are other reasons unrelated to Sharia law for this situation. We examine those and suggest solutions for the same.

<strong>Market Makers can improve secondary market liquidity</strong>
Many Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions tend to participate in Sukuk issuances in the primary market, but are not active in the secondary market, and tend to hold the Sukuk till maturity. Historically, this was because of the scarcity of Sukuk and finding a replacement after selling a Sukuk would be difficult. Because of this, unlike conventional bonds, the Sukuk secondary market suffers from a lack of market makers, which are usually large financial institutions. A more liquid market can be created if large Islamic institutions act as market makers. In addition, funds specialising in Sukuk with high Assets under Management (AUM) can act as market makers. There are encouraging signs with many Sukuk funds being offered by Islamic and conventional financial institutions. As the AUM of Sukuk funds increase, market makers can emerge which would help the secondary market liquidity. The inclusion of Sukuk bonds in the JP Morgan EM Bond Index fund in 2016 is another positive for liquidity since the included Sukuk bonds would attract bids from funds tracking the index.

</span> <strong>Learn more </strong></span></a></blockquote>

<strong>Improving Geographic Concentration</strong>
Malaysia was the global leader in Sukuk issuances accounting for nearly 61% of issuances made since 2001. GCC comes next with a 24% market share. Other major players are Indonesia with 7.25% and Turkey with 2.5%. Together they constitute 95% of global Sukuk issuances. Other countries with large Muslim populations like Pakistan and Bangladesh currently have a miniscule market share. With their economies hit hard by Covid-19, this presents an opportunity for them to raise funds through Sukuk for infrastructure development. The Sukuk market can also be extended to emerging and developed economies with large minority Muslim populations who might want to invest in sharia-compliant financial products. The emergence of ESG investing offers another opportunity to increase awareness of Sukuk beyond Malaysia and the GCC. These factors can improve liquidity in the secondary markets

<strong>Standardisation of regulations</strong>
Currently, most of the issuances and trading happens in the domestic markets and cross-border issuances are few and trading non-existent. This is mainly due to the lack of standardised regulations applicable globally. There are many Sukuk products which are allowed to be traded in Malaysia, but not in the GCC, for example. This makes investing in Sukuk largely a local affair, with very few participation from foreign investors. Standardisation of regulations would allow for cross-border issuances and trading. For example, the Formosa Sukuk market, launched in Taiwan in 2019 has enabled GCC issuers to sell Sukuk bonds to Taiwanese insurers. Standardisation of regulation can enable issuance in many more countries.

<strong>More Sukuk should be rated</strong>
A rated Sukuk is preferred by investors because of the impartial opinion given by third party credit agencies and whether the underlying asset will yield the profits to be expected. If the structure of the Sukuk asset is too complex, then the issuing company or government’s rating can be used for marketing the issuance. Many global funds require the investments to be rated and so rated Sukuk are better placed to be bought by such funds and becoming more liquid in the process.

<strong>Scarcity and the Hold-to-Maturity culture</strong>
As Sukuk becomes more popular and issuances increase, the scarcity problem would eventually cease. More important would be clarity in interpretation of various legal clauses as the recent case involving UAE-based Dana Gas - which had to restructure its Sukuk after a long legal battle - shows.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>
The Sukuk market has made steady progress since its inception in 2000 and has become a key element of Islamic Banking and Finance. Further progress depends in part on a vibrant secondary market with willing buyers and sellers. Covid-19 has resulted in Governments and Corporates rush to the credit markets to fill the holes in their budgets and balance sheets. This gives an opportunity for more Sukuk issuance and solve the scarcity problem. By taking actions to improve the secondary market, a virtuous cycle of liquid markets resulting in more issuances in turn improving liquidity can be unleashed.[:]]]></Content>

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]The GCC has seen a number of <strong><a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/reits-in-gcc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)</u></a></strong> listed in stock exchanges in the past few years. This accelerated after Saudi Arabia’s Capital Markets Authority (CMA) approved the listing of REITs in 2016 as a part of the National Transformation Program (NTP) and Saudi Vision 2030. Due to the economic crisis in the wake of the covid-19 pandemic, many of the listed REITs have seen a steep decline in their share prices and market capitalisations. Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul REIT Index has fallen 13.5% for 2020 compared to an 18.4% fall for the S&P GCC Composite index. In this article, we examine the impact of Covid-19 on GCC REITs listed on GCC stock exchanges.

<strong>Weak Real Estate Sector hits Dubai listed REITs</strong>
Dubai real estate market has been oversupplied for many years and hence both prices and rents of apartments, villas and commercial buildings have come down since the peak in 2014 and further deteriorated due to the Covid-19 crisis. According to ValuStrat, sale of apartments and villas declined by 50% (MoM) in April compared to March 2020. This after March 2020 sales was down 42% (YoY) from that of March 2019. While property prices and rents fell by 10% for the first quarter of 2020. The UAE government has also requested property owners to waive rents for commercial and retail tenants who were affected by the lockdown. This has directly impacted REITs listed in Dubai, Emirates REIT and Enbd REIT. Their share prices have fallen by 64% and 28%, respectively for the year till date. The fall has been so drastic that both the Dubai-listed REITs are trading at well below their Net Asset Value. According to their annual reports, Emirates REIT reported a loss of USD 25 million for 2019 and Enbd REIT reported a loss of USD 9.4 million due to the exposure to the UAE real estate market. This indicates that the REITs were in trouble before the Covid-19 crisis hit, which further exacerbated the situation. Both the REITs are also in negotiations with tenants of properties in the portfolio over rent waivers. Both have suspended dividend payments for 2020 due to the weak UAE Real estate market. This has meant that foreign investors have sold both of them in the markets, particularly Emirates REIT leading to its market capitalisation falling to USD 61 million.

<strong>Saudi Arabia Listed REITs have fared better</strong>
Saudi Arabia currently has 16 REITs listed in the Tadawul stock exchanges. Of which, only 2 have seen a fall greater than 20% for 2020. The REIT with the largest market capitalisation, Jadwa REIT Saudi Fund had seen a substantial fall earlier, but has since regained much of the losses and is up 3.4% for the year. This was after an announcement by Jadwa REIT that it was suspending management fees for 2020 and also looking into requests from tenants for temporary rent reductions. Saudi-listed REITs with available data reported profits for 2019 and entered the Covid-19 crisis in a better position than the Dubai-listed REITs. As a result, the fall in stock markets has been less severe but still significant with many trading at close to their 52-week lows.

The Exhibit below compares the current share price of GCC REITs with their 52 Week highs and lows. REITs in Kuwait and other GCC exchanges are not included because they have not been listed in exchanges or traded in the past 52 weeks.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>
The Real estate industry has been hit hard by the covid-19 crisis which has in turn affected the profitability of REITs. REITs listed in Dubai with exposure to Dubai’s real estate sector have been particularly affected. Saudi Arabia listed REITs with better fundamentals like Jadwa REIT have seen interest from investors in recent weeks. However, with the number of Coronavirus cases rising in the GCC, a clear picture can emerge only if the pandemic is controlled to some extent. Until then, GCC REITs are expected to see muted gains.[:]]]></Content>

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]COVID-19 has rendered economic outlook and companies’ performance projections for 2020 meaningless in a single stroke. Heightened uncertainty has become an everyday reality in the current times. As the coronavirus scare continues, the world is faced with multidimensional issues and tough questions, be it finding an effective treatment for the virus, zeroing in on an optimal quantum of stimulus or deciding the right time to lift lockdowns. With measures like social distancing and lockdowns affecting day-to-day lives of people, asset classes are feeling the heat too.

<strong>Equities</strong>
As one of the quickest asset classes to price in developments, equities have seen a huge slump. The spread of virus and associated lockdowns have affected production, supply chains and demand across countries and sectors. Travel restrictions and lockdowns across the world has hurt oil demand. While oil demand for 2020 is expected to drop by 10.8 million barrels per day(bpd), the demand for jet fuel is expected to drop by 2.4 million bpd (Rystad Energy), demand for road fuel is expected to drop by 5.3 million bpd. This demand destruction pushed oil prices to historical lows.
For GCC, these lower oil prices add to the impact of coronavirus. In addition to affecting the oil based sectors, low oil prices would cause government revenues to fall and in turn reduce government spending on non-oil sector. These factors precipitated fears about economic growth in general and corporate earnings in particular, pushing stock prices down. Of the GCC countries, Dubai is most at risk with 32% of its GDP coming from sectors affected by social distancing (MUFG). This has reflected in its equity performance too.

<strong>Year to Date Performance of GCC Markets(%)</strong>

</span> <strong>Learn more </strong></span></a></blockquote>

Social distancing and lockdowns have affected almost all sectors, the difference being only in the degree of impact. Travel and Tourism and Energy have taken a direct hit because of the travel restrictions and postponement of events. Possibility of spike in infections as lockdowns ease poses a risk for these sectors. With credit exposure to multiple sectors, banking would be considerably impacted by probable deterioration in asset quality and measures like deferment of loan repayments. Comprising of companies involved in essentials such as food processing, consumer non-cyclicals appears as bright spot amongst other sectors.

Cyclicals includes Hospitality, Tourism; Basic Materials includes Construction; Industrials includes Aviation, Logistics. Non-cyclicals include food processing etc.</span>

Before the virus’ onset, the market valuations in GCC had recovered from 2016 lows (P/E ratio of GCC Price Return Index: 1st January 2020 – 14.4; 2016; 21st January 2016-9.1). The P/E ratio of the GCC price return index fell from a value of 14.4 as of 1st January 2020 to 10.8 in mid-march, on the back of market wide sell-off due to COVID-19. However, the stimulus measures by GCC central banks and governments and plans to ease lockdown have caused an uptick in stock prices and in turn in valuation. While the current P/E ratio at 13.04 (As of 24th May 2020) , remains slightly lower than value at the beginning of the year, it is based on the healthier corporate earnings of the last 12 months. As the impact of COVID-19 on underlying corporate earnings picture continues to remain grim and uncertain, it remains to be seen if the valuations could sustain at current levels.

Concerns of limited policy space to cushion COVID-19 impact and economic slowdown increase foreign capital outflows, contributing to the fall in equity markets. For example, in March 2020, foreign equity outflows from Saudi Arabia amounted to USD 722 million (Preliminary Data from IIF).
Bonds and Sukuk

While preference for bonds over equities in uncertain times and interest rate cuts by central banks of countries are support factors for bonds in general, credit strength and perception of risk associated with each borrower would determine demand for their bonds.
For example, considered as a strong borrower, the U.S 10-year Treasury yield has dropped from 1.88% on 1st January 2020 to 0.69% on 12th May 2020. In GCC, the oil price crash has increased the perception of the region’s credit risk. This had reflected in the widening of 5-year CDS spreads and fall in prices of sovereign bonds in mid-March.

<strong>5-year CDS Spreads (in bps)</strong>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-4548" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Implications-of-COVID-19-on-GCC-Asset-Classes-Fig3.png" alt="5-year CDS Spreads" width="549" height="198" />
<span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #696969; font-size: 10px;">Source: Refinitiv; Note: Bahrain’s CDS reached a high of 508 in the first week of May.</span>
<blockquote>The bond yields for GCC countries have narrowed recently, supported by improvement in oil prices and introduction of austerity measures. For Bahrain and Oman, yields remain above 2019 levels because of concerns over their weak fiscal positions. Further yield movements would hinge on recovery in oil prices and governments’ implementation of austerity measures. A favourable outcome on these factors would improve the GCC countries’ fiscal position and credit strength.</blockquote>

As revenue declines on the back of fall in oil prices, debt maturities add to financial concerns. For example, by the end of 2020, Dubai and its government-linked firms face USD 9.2 billion of debt repayment . The table below showcases the upcoming bond repayments for Saudi Arabia and UAE.

<strong>Bond Redemption (All Currency) in 2020-22 (USD Billion)</strong>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-4548" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Implications-of-COVID-19-on-GCC-Asset-Classes-Fig5.png" alt="Bond Redemption (All Currency) in 2020-22" width="549" height="198" />
<span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #696969; font-size: 10px;">Source: IIF</span>

Low oil prices and stimulus measures to handle COVID-19 have brought GCC governments’ fiscal position under pressure, necessitating borrowing. This might increase sovereign issuances.

Investment grade corporate bonds yields have widened by a smaller margin than sovereigns like Bahrain, which have lower credit rating compared to their peers. While investment grade corporate bonds might continue to be viewed favourably, fear of defaults might drive investor exit from high-yield bonds. For example, while the S&P GCC Sukuk Index yield has narrowed by 24 bps, S&P GCC High Yield Sukuk Index’s yield has widened by 198 bps (As on 21st May 2020).

<strong>Real Estate</strong>
The spread of the virus, lockdowns and job losses might lead to decreased demand for real estate sector in the near term. In countries like UAE, where oversupply had been a concern before the virus outbreak, the impact might be compounded.

<strong>Covid-19 Implications on Real Estate Asset Class</strong>

Given the magnitude of the global humanitarian challenge and the end for pandemic nowhere in sight, the asset classes might take time to recover. The actual bottoming out of the pandemic or an effective vaccine would provide the much needed optimism and boost for the markets. However, the recent relaxation of lockdowns with governments calling for learning to live with COVID-19 by implementing safety measures might be favourable in the near term. When the crisis does bottom out, government measures and credit conditions would support recovery.[:]]]></Content>

		<Title>[:en]Will COVID-19 reduce the appetite for renewable energy projects in the GCC?[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]The outbreak of <a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/gcc-coronavirus-dashboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">COVID-19</a> has deeply impacted global economies, pushing them into a recession. As health and economic concerns continue to mount, the near-term outlook for renewable energy projects look weak. GCC countries have taken a strong hit in the revenue side of their books due to the sharp fall in oil prices during 2020. The shortfall in revenue and rise in deficits are expected to have a strong near-term impact on project awards in the renewable energy space. GCC countries, which are predominantly dependent on fossil fuel for energy generation, have exhibited their commitment in gravitating towards renewables by laying ambitious targets for the next 10-15 years. However, project awards in recent years has been sluggish, with several of them facing delays. The slump in oil prices since 2014 has weighed in on GCC countries’ capital expenditure, causing the slowdown in awarding new projects. As project activity showed signs of recovery during the start of 2020, the outbreak of coronavirus has turned the tables upside down.

GCC countries had set lofty targets for ramping up their renewable energy capacity in the coming years as part of their long-term visions. For instance, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have set a target of 15% and 30% of their respective power generation to come from renewable and other clean energy sources by 2030. Their renewable energy share stood at 0.4% and 0.2% respectively as of 2018 end. The crisis triggered by the pandemic is expected to delay the award of projects in the near-term, leaving the already ambitious renewable energy targets of GCC countries much harder to achieve now.

[caption id="attachment_4602" align="alignnone" width="800"]<a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/saudi-power/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="wp-image-4602 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Saudi-Power-Sector_800x150.jpg" alt="Saudi Power Sector – Challenges & Opportunities post Covid-19" width="800" height="150" /></a> <a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/saudi-power/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marmore Research Report</a>[/caption]

Potential problem areas in the short term are many. Suppliers for equipment such as low-cost PV (Photo-voltaic) modules, solar cells, turbines, and other equipment are largely based out of China and Europe. Until normalcy resumes in manufacturing and logistics, free movement of components will face disruptions. Another difficulty lies in engaging migrant labour, as restricted movement of workers between countries will pose a significant challenge. New protocols such as social distancing in work environment could also serve up to delay the progress of ongoing projects. Depending on how the pandemic is being handled by governments across the world, the speed of recovery could vary.

Once near-term disruptions wane, renewable projects that were earlier in pipeline would normally be expected to resume. However, there is a risk of renewable projects being side-lined, with other objectives taking precedence. Primary reason to this is that GCC countries have sufficient oil and gas resources, and existing installed capacity for fossil fuel power generation. With generation of power from renewable resources being seen more as a long-term objective, it runs a risk of not being given importance. But there is a pressing need for GCC countries to focus on clean energy. The UN sustainability goals indicates that countries should move towards more affordable and clean energy. GCC lags most developed countries in their transition towards renewables and has a long way to go in order to meet its sustainability goals for power generation. GCC region has higher CO2 and particulate emissions than the global average due to refinement and combustion of fuel, potentially leading to adverse health effects in the long run.

When oil prices are high, there is an inclination to proceed with renewable energy projects as high-priced oil could be a lucrative commodity for export. However, when oil price are low, the incentive to move towards renewable energy is less due to narrower profit margins from export and higher investment costs for renewable projects. But from a long term-perspective, with renewable energy generation cost falling and peak oil demand yet to come, moving towards renewables sooner would free-up more resources for export. With climatic conditions in the GCC favouring solar power generation and projects becoming more cost effective, the case for transition is much stronger now.

The revival of renewable energy projects needs strong government support both from a financial and policy perspective. Near-term shocks emanating from COVID-19 need to be absorbed without deferring capital expenditure. Upcoming renewable infrastructure projects is expected to drive new employment opportunities and save fossil fuel for export purposes. Financial support must be provided to ongoing projects through the easing of lending norms and provision of support through subsidies would help project stakeholders avoid cost overruns. In countries like Germany, the provision of subsidies for a period of 20 years has helped renewable energy operators stay profitable. After the period, margins are lesser. Therefore, GCC countries must look at much more sustainable models of renewable power generation that turns profit after a stage when subsidies are removed.

According to the IEA, global energy investments in the year 2020, which was earlier predicted to grow by 2%, is now poised to see a decline of 20% due to the outbreak of COVID-19. However, the positive news is that renewable energy investments have been much more resilient when compared to those of fossil fuel. Although the near-term trend suggests that the awards for renewable energy project will take a back-seat, there are strong global cues indicating that the push for clean energy will only increase after the crisis. Environmental and health concerns surrounding recent events have presented a strong case for moving towards cleaner sources of energy generation and improving energy efficiency. Investors have also been showing more appetite towards financing sustainable projects, with the green finance market witnessing sharp growth in the past five years. As the global energy landscape prepares itself for a transformation, GCC countries need to ensure that they are not left behind. Although COVID-19 has more or less forced the hand of GCC governments to pause activity in the renewable projects space over the short-term, governments need to prioritize renewable energy investments in the long run and continue to move towards their clean energy goals.[:]]]></Content>

		<Title>[:en]Fund houses revise their long-term capital market expectations - What has changed?[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]The unprecedented turn of events in recent times has drastically changed the outlook of the global economy in the near term. The economic disruption caused by COVID-19 has triggered global central banks and governments to act, changing the whole landscape for financial and real assets both in the short and long term. Things look much different now as compared to the end of 2019. Several asset classes witnessed a sharp sell-off and a subsequent recovery in recent months. Everything from valuations, macroeconomic indicators and risk appetite have changed within a short span of time. While the impact of COVID-19 is expected to wane away in the next few years, the global fund houses have revised their long-term capital market expectations for 2020 in light of the new reality.

The views of global fund houses slightly differ, the commonalities suggest that there is much more optimism in selected equity and private assets compared to fixed income due to the current low rate scenario. J.P. Morgan does not expect the current recession to significantly affect the growth in the long run as most of the current losses have been taken on to the government’s balance sheets. Household spending and corporate financial health is not expected to suffer a major deterioration in the long run, therefore their change in forecasts are much more reliant on valuations and current prices. Blackrock believes that the near-term impact (a three-quarter timeframe) of COVID-19 on economic activity to be much severe compared to the global financial crisis. However, with appropriate policy response and execution, the impact over the long term could be much less extreme compared to the global financial crisis. Invesco considers a U-shaped recession as their Base case but is less optimistic about long term returns for most asset classes as compared to pre-COVID-19 expectations.

<strong>Changes in 10 Year return expectations of Global fund houses</strong>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4792" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Changes-in-10-Year-return-expectations-of-Global-fund-houses.png" alt="" width="800" height="762" />
<span style="color: #696969; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;">Source: Respective company websites/reports</span>

<strong>Equities</strong>
Expected returns of equity markets have largely risen due to the drop in price levels during recent months. However, the revisions have only been mild due to expected deterioration in earnings over the next few years. The reversion of earnings growth back to pre-COVID 19 levels is expected to be gradual. Based on prior recessions, earnings growth is likely to contract in the first year before recovering in the third year and eventually reverting to its long-term average growth rate by the fifth year. U.S. equities have remained expensive compared to other developed markets. Yet they are expected to continue setting the pace for global equity markets due to their strong fundamentals and bias towards technology stocks. Major fund houses J.P. Morgan and Blackrock expect valuations to return to their peak once normalcy resumes. The recent fall in index levels have prompted both fund house to sharply increase their expected returns in U.S equities for the next 10 years. Invesco, whose long-term return expectations for U.S. equities were higher than other major fund houses before COVID-19 outbreak, has reduced their expected returns mildly, but continue to favour U.S. markets over others. Among emerging and other developed markets, the economies that are more self sufficient and isolated to others are expected to perform better than those that heavily rely on external demand. Emerging market return expectations have been revised upwards by most fund houses, while their risk also remains significantly high. The fall in valuations and the relative underperformance of emerging markets in the past five years have led to higher expectations for the next 10 years.

<strong>Fixed income</strong>
The strength of government and corporate balance sheets, recovery of economic growth and future demand will be key determinants of fixed income performance in the coming years. Government bond returns have fallen and in most cases are now negative in real terms. Although duration is set to remain in demand while the world is in recession, fund houses are not very optimistic on developed market bonds in the long term. The likelihood of corporate defaults in expected to be above average for the next 3-4 years. Furthermore, Blackrock believes that the case for nominal developed market government bonds has diminished. Inflation-linked bonds may become the preferable risk absorbing asset, if de-globalization and supply chain changes pick up pace, governments ramp up support and inflation begins to emerge.

<strong>Alternatives</strong>
Hedge funds remain attractive on a risk-adjusted basis due to their ability to provide alpha beyond their exposure to traditional asset classes. Likewise, the outlook of private equity remained high due to their ability in terms of alpha generation in the medium to long term. Dry powder of private equity funds can be deployed at much lower entry multiples now due to the fall in valuation of businesses. Major fund houses have revised the expectations for real estate upwards but remain cautious. Despite a strong rally in Gold during recent months, the return expectations are largely unchanged. The weaker dollar and an eventual rebound in inflation to support returns for gold in the long run. Weakening of demand for oil and other commodities has led global fund houses to tone down their expectations for a basket of commodities.
GCC markets have been grabbing the attention of global investors in recent times due recent capital market reforms and possessing a stable economy backed by sizeable reserves. However, the coverage on long term return expectations on GCC markets in the public domain has been scarce. To provide clarity to investors on GCC countries and bridge the gap in information, Marmore has published reports on 5-year equity market return expectations for individual GCC countries, clearly outlining their future prospects, assumptions, and growth potential.

		<Title>[:en]Kuwait Sector Indices: Comparison of declines due to COVID-19 and 2014-16 Oil Price Crash[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]The 2020 market crash has been fast and short, if the trough of March 2020 holds. Lockdown to prevent the spread of COVID-19 brought about an uneven impact on sectors. While some sectors like airlines came to an absolute standstill, some sectors like technology stand to gain from the lockdown. These differences have reflected in the performance of equities too. A sector-wise comparison with the previous market crash of 2014-16 highlights the difference in COVID-19’s impact on sectors and what sets the current crisis apart. 

<strong>Origin</strong>
Performance of sectors in bear markets depend on what caused the market crash. In 2016, oil prices had crashed by about 75% from their peak in 2014. This was mainly because of the supply glut caused by the U.S. shale oil production. As a country with oil-based economy, that had affected Kuwait’s equity markets too. The bear market was caused by a structural issue, causing a general economic downturn, affecting all sectors.

The decline in equities in 2020 was event-driven caused by - a) lockdowns implemented to contain the spread of COVID-19; b) decline in oil prices due to demand erosion on the back of lockdown and travel restrictions.

<strong>Sectors better off compared to 2014-16</strong>
Being essentials, consumer goods have seen less impact. As COVID-19 is a health crisis, the healthcare sector is bound to be a thrust area and is expected to see higher growth going forward. Financials services’ deeper fall in 2014-16 seems to be because of the higher valuations at that time.

The incorporation of technology in businesses has continued to increase and has come to be considered indispensable. Its importance has shot up further in a COVID-19 world. From smooth working from home, e-driven business/bureaucratic processes to data governance and cyber security, technology has become ubiquitous. All these make it an all-weather sector for current times.

Though the oil prices have fallen in recent times too, the sector index has not fallen by as much as the previous crash. The reason could be that while the 2014-16 crash was systemic in terms of a supply glut with increase in shale oil production, the present fall has been caused by demand destruction that is driven by an event. In general, systemic issues tend to have a harder impact and slower recovery than external events (Goldman Sachs Research). The fall in prices so far has been of slightly less magnitude too. In the 2014-16 crash, the oil prices had fallen by 75% from peak to trough, whereas in the current crisis they have fallen by 65%.

Real Estate is another sector that has seen lesser fall in prices. While closure of businesses and reduced income levels would affect real estate in terms of sales and rent payments, the sector index’s fall has been less than that of 2014-16. This could be because though the sector was stable while entering 2020 (IMF ), it has not been at its peak as it had been in 2014. That could explain the decline of lower magnitude. Expectation of a smooth recovery after COVID-19 and resumption of business as usual could have also contributed to the lesser fall. The downside for the sector would be reduction in demand due to near term uncertainty over COVID-19 and expat repatriation. 

<strong>Sectors worse off compared to 2014-16</strong>
Consumer services and Industrials have fallen by a greater margin than 2014-16. These are the sectors that have been particularly affected because of the lockdown. Supply chain disruptions and demand erosion affects sectors like logistics that constitute industrials. Travel restrictions have impacted consumer services comprising of hospitality and airlines. Implementation of social distancing in the near term might continue to weigh on the consumer services sector. Banks’ exposure to all sectors including the ones that have more affected by lockdown have caused the sector to fall by a slightly greater margin. Availability of construction materials, work stoppage to contain coronavirus spread have affected construction sector, contributing to the decline in basic materials.

The reasons for the difference in declines in sectors could be attributed to the nature of the crisis -2014-16 being structural and that of 2020 being event driven – and the lockdown measures. The question of whether markets have bottomed out persists, given the uncertainty over the coronavirus scare and the nature of economic recovery. But be it further fall or recovery, the trend in the impact on sectors is likely to hold.

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]The EdTech industry is transforming traditional learning methods by blending digital capabilities and the widespread penetration of digital devices within the general population. EdTech platforms have mushroomed to encompass adaptive learning, animated content, gamification, etc. (Khaleej Times). Globally, the EdTech industry recorded a total investment of USD 18.7bn in 2019, following a record of USD 16.3bn in 2018 (Ibid ).

It is notable that the combined investments in 2018 and 2019 are greater than the total combined investment recorded from 1998 through 2017, a period of quarter century. Within the Mena region too, deals rose from four in 2016 to over 30 in 2019 (Ibid ). There is much investment interest too in Mena. Mena EdTech startups raised over USD 25.2mn in PE and VC funding, for 2019.

In the current and post-pandemic world, EdTech will play a greater role; however, it needs huge investments in telecom and infrastructure, faster data connectivity and capacity building. Moreover, Covid-19 has enabled the education sector to realize the strong potential of digital learning (Inc42). Also, due to the challenges that schools are facing due to the lockdown in many parts of the world, EdTech companies have enabled tools and platforms like live doubt-clearing sessions, e-books, etc.

EdTech can also be used to strategize and tailor the syllabi, addressing the distinct learning interests or specialized learning requirements (Entrepreneur Media ). The potential of EdTech in the GCC is evidenced by Kuwait-based Baims. Founded in 2017, Baims started operations with customized tutoring modules based on university curricula (Wamda ). It then expanded its capacities to include multiple colleges and universities in both Kuwait and Riyadh. The startup, reportedly, managed to break even within 24 hours.

<blockquote><a href="https://www.databook.marmoremena.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong> Did You Know? </strong> 
<span style="color: #800000;"> 
<ul class="rdetails_list" style="text-align: left;">
<li style="text-align: left;">Kuwait has the highest reserves among GCC countries, relative to its GDP at 542%. </li>
<li style="text-align: left;"> Saudi Arabia is expected to enjoy the highest credit growth at 5.3% in 2020. </li>
<li style="text-align: left;"> UAE could continue to enjoy surplus trade position in 2020. </li>
</span> <a href="https://www.databook.marmoremena.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <strong>Learn more </strong></span></a></blockquote>

A key enabler for EdTech is the fact that the devices are getting smarter and more efficient (Appinventiv ). A web of interconnectivity using big data Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help in driving autonomous customer experiences (CX), adding a highly personalized dimension to EdTech. There are several other emerging benefits of EdTech too. Some of them are (Ibid ) –

<ul class="rdetails_list">
 	<li>Digital accessing of education could help ensure a border-less or international experience, helping in the emergence of B2C education distribution channels.</li>
 	<li>With learning material getting remotely accessible, EdTech could catalyze ‘education for all’.</li>
 	<li>Education could be customized to each student, enabling self-paced classes to become commonplace.</li>
 	<li>For those differently abled, innovating customized provisions becomes possible and easier, thus empowering access to quality education.</li>
</ul>

Incidentally, EdTech is being seen as a tool for upskilling for a future-ready workforce too (CNBC ). It is because education doesn’t just end after college in an era of strident tech disruptions, mandating continuous learning as important to protect jobs in the process. The ongoing pandemic health crisis has made sure that nothing will likely be the same as before the great lockdown (India Today ). In education too, online platforms that were once seen as useful supplements to conventional education infrastructure will become deeply mainstream. Undoubtedly, this will change the fashion in which academic content is created, personally consumed and deployed across platforms.

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">As 2020 began with new hopes, little did the world know about an emerging threat coming out of the most populous country on Earth, a virus which spread like a wildfire in no time. The contagious nature of the virus made it more so difficult to contain it. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a <strong>Public Health Emergency of International Concern</strong> on 30 January 2020, and a pandemic on 11 March. On 28th June 2020, the global confirmed cases breached a grim milestone of 10 million confirmed cases, out of which about 5.14 million people have recovered and 0.5 million deaths have been reported.</p>

This is also a result of widespread testing across the United States, which may not be as prevalent in other countries.

In the GCC region, Dubai was the first to report COVID-19 case in late January, the progression was very slow initially, but from the month of May onwards the number of cases surged. Saudi Arabia leads in terms of total COVID-19 confirmed cases, however on cases per million basis Qatar has reported the maximum number of cases. A closer look into the trend of ‘number of days taken to double for GCC’ reveals that UAE and Qatar have managed to extend the days to double, which implies their response to COVID has been successful in curbing the pace of spread.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Policy responses to COVID-19 (IMF)</strong>
The pandemic led to social and economic disruption across the globe. Many countries took measures like lockdown and curfews which led to panic buying, supply shortages and postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political, and cultural events. Even schools, universities, and colleges were closed. Businesses suffered due to non-operation and lack of revenues. Economies across the globe were virtually put on a standstill. These measures led to job losses and bankruptcies. The USA not happy with the WHO’s role in handling the pandemic halted funding.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">GCC had to deal with dual challenge of COVID-19 and Oil price crash. Suspension of inbound commercial flights, closing schools and universities, banning public celebrations and gathering, suspension of nonessential work in governmental entities were common across the region.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Post lockdown and curfews, the economic conditions deteriorated across nations, with people struggling to meet ends for living. This prompted re-opening of the economies with certain restrictions. But the damage was already done and to make up for the losses, Governments were forced to introduce economic measures. In terms of policy response, stimulus packages were announced across the board. The US lowered its Federal Fund rates by 150 basis points to 0 - 0.25bp and announced stimulus package of USD3.6 trillion, out which about half of the stimulus are loans to businesses and governments. In the Euro area, the European Central Bank (ECB) has announced robust monetary policy and supervisory measures. Across European Union, in order to contain the fallout of economic activity, the Governments implemented various fiscal measures (<a href="https://www.bruegel.org/publications/datasets/covid-national-dataset/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BRUEGEL</a>)</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>How soon to Re-open or return to normal?</strong>
Many nations are still grappling with the pandemic, while few have set examples for others to follow. Countries like China, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea, were quite effective in controlling the spread and are currently re-opening their economies. Vietnam also stands out for not reporting a single COVID casualty to date. In GCC UAE is leading from the front, as the number of confirmed cases reported is on a fast declining trajectory, and re-opening measures are being adopted commensurately. Kuwait has also entered into its second phase of return to normal life, wherein public and private sectors are allowed to resume work with less than 30% workforce, work in shopping malls, financial sector, construction sector, retail shops, parks, and pick-ups from restaurants and cafes are allowed from 30th June 2020. Saudi Arabia moved with caution towards its final stages of de-escalation as all economic and commercial activities have restarted and about 75% of public employees have resumed office.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There has been instances of re-occurrence in countries like South Korea, New Zealand, China, and Singapore. This reminds that the COVID-19 is here to stay for some more time. To expedite the return to normalcy the world is working on a record pace to come up with a vaccine. According to the data compiled by The New York Times, there are more than 125 preclinical trials underway and 3 trials have reached the phase 3. However, an approval is yet pending for mass immunisation to begin.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker</strong>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Covid-Article-Infographic.jpg" alt="Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker" width="800" height="762" />

<p style="text-align: left;">The concept of herd immunity is still a distance away, as it either requires about 70% of the population to get infected and develop immunity towards the virus or most of the population needs to be vaccinated. By not following social distancing and taking corrective actions to curb the spread in order to achieve herd immunity, may lead to overwhelming hospitals and cause more deaths (Johns Hopkins University). Going forward as economies attempt to re-open occurrence of COVID spikes is inevitable, applying caution and taking necessary actions to curb the spread would be the key.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Does recent stock market recovery point to a disconnect between economic realities?</strong>
COVID-19 led the global stock markets plunge from all-time high to report the worst losses in over a decade. Developed countries except USA, are still trading at ~15% lower from their levels last seen in January 2020. The USA stock markets has recouped almost all its losses as it had multiple rounds of rally following Fed’s intervention, hope of vaccine development, economic stimulus and economy re-opening. A large section believed that the worst is behind us and that the COVID-19 has already peaked, opening the path for resumption of normal life.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">GCC markets on the other hand had to deal with twin crisis of COVID-19 and oil price crash. COVID-19 led fall in demand for oil and price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia resulted in the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude to trade at negative $37 per barrel on 20th April 2020. With an agreement reached at a later stage between Russia and Saudi Arabia for production cuts, the oil has bounced back to certain extent. Recovery in oil prices and re-opening of economies in a phased manner led to recovery in the GCC stock markets, however Dubai, Bahrain and Kuwait are still lagging with YTD returns of worse than -15%.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Given the impact that the lockdown measures had on businesses, many sectors are expected to report declining profitability and have announced culling of dividends. In this scenario, the disconnect looks to widen with every bounce of recovery in the stock markets. Overall, although the situation looks to be improving, caution needs to be practised, as experts warn against the second wave of coronavirus, which could spill more troubles for the economies and markets in the near future.</p>

<blockquote><strong>Conclusion</strong>
Economies reeling under the COVID crisis needs to take cues from Internationally, acclaimed success stories in terms of lockdown exit options. Among them are countries like South Korea and Taiwan. Some of the common themes emerging from these models include –
- Ramping up testing and deploying technology to better understand local spread or epidemiology, meticulous contact tracing and testing, and collating data to provide tailored insights to communities.
- Greater use of location-specific or cluster-oriented measures instead of blanket lockdowns.
- Methodically following legacy measures such as social distancing, restrictions on mass gatherings, etc., while enforcing sanitation (e.g., use of facemasks in public spaces).

With respect to the GCC, a phased opening may be suitable. A preparatory phase can commence with lockdown de-escalation with minor easing of people movement restrictions, including permitting personal daily walks and physical exercises with prescribed time slots for residents to leave their homes. Then, some businesses can be allowed to reopen, but with appointments only, with people aged over 65 as part of <strong>‘vulnerability shielding’.</strong></blockquote>[:ar]<p style="text-align: left;">As 2020 began with new hopes, little did the world know about an emerging threat coming out of the most populous country on Earth, a virus which spread like a wildfire in no time.

<p style="text-align: left;">Qatar also fares well in containing the fatality rate, which has been relatively higher for UAE, but the 7 day moving average of daily deaths per million population indicates that Deaths in UAE has already peaked and is steadily declining. On the other hand, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia suffer with reasonably lower number of days to double and high fatality rate.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Policy responses to COVID-19 (IMF)</strong>
The pandemic led to social and economic disruption across the globe. Many countries took measures like lockdown and curfews which led to panic buying, supply shortages and postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political, and cultural events. Even schools, universities, and colleges were closed. Businesses suffered due to non-operation and lack of revenues. Economies across the globe were virtually put on a standstill. These measures led to job losses and bankruptcies. The USA not happy with the WHO’s role in handling the pandemic halted funding.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">GCC had to deal with dual challenge of COVID-19 and Oil price crash. Suspension of inbound commercial flights, closing schools and universities, banning public celebrations and gathering, suspension of nonessential work in governmental entities were common across the region.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Post lockdown and curfews, the economic conditions deteriorated across nations, with people struggling to meet ends for living. This prompted re-opening of the economies with certain restrictions. But the damage was already done and to make up for the losses, Governments were forced to introduce economic measures. In terms of policy response, stimulus packages were announced across the board. The US lowered its Federal Fund rates by 150 basis points to 0 - 0.25bp and announced stimulus package of USD3.6 trillion, out which about half of the stimulus are loans to businesses and governments. In the Euro area, the European Central Bank (ECB) has announced robust monetary policy and supervisory measures. Across European Union, in order to contain the fallout of economic activity, the Governments implemented various fiscal measures (<a href="https://www.bruegel.org/publications/datasets/covid-national-dataset/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BRUEGEL</a>)</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>How soon to Re-open or return to normal?</strong>
Many nations are still grappling with the pandemic, while few have set examples for others to follow. Countries like China, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea, were quite effective in controlling the spread and are currently re-opening their economies. Vietnam also stands out for not reporting a single COVID casualty to date. In GCC UAE is leading from the front, as the number of confirmed cases reported is on a fast declining trajectory, and re-opening measures are being adopted commensurately. Kuwait has also entered into its second phase of return to normal life, wherein public and private sectors are allowed to resume work with less than 30% workforce, work in shopping malls, financial sector, construction sector, retail shops, parks, and pick-ups from restaurants and cafes are allowed from 30th June 2020. Saudi Arabia moved with caution towards its final stages of de-escalation as all economic and commercial activities have restarted and about 75% of public employees have resumed office.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There has been instances of re-occurrence in countries like South Korea, New Zealand, China, and Singapore. This reminds that the COVID-19 is here to stay for some more time. To expedite the return to normalcy the world is working on a record pace to come up with a vaccine. According to the data compiled by The New York Times, there are more than 125 preclinical trials underway and 3 trials have reached the phase 3. However, an approval is yet pending for mass immunisation to begin.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker</strong>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Covid-Article-Infographic.jpg" alt="Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker" width="800" height="762" />

<p style="text-align: left;">The concept of herd immunity is still a distance away, as it either requires about 70% of the population to get infected and develop immunity towards the virus or most of the population needs to be vaccinated. By not following social distancing and taking corrective actions to curb the spread in order to achieve herd immunity, may lead to overwhelming hospitals and cause more deaths (Johns Hopkins University). Going forward as economies attempt to re-open occurrence of COVID spikes is inevitable, applying caution and taking necessary actions to curb the spread would be the key.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Does recent stock market recovery point to a disconnect between economic realities?</strong>
COVID-19 led the global stock markets plunge from all-time high to report the worst losses in over a decade. Developed countries except USA, are still trading at ~15% lower from their levels last seen in January 2020. The USA stock markets has recouped almost all its losses as it had multiple rounds of rally following Fed’s intervention, hope of vaccine development, economic stimulus and economy re-opening. A large section believed that the worst is behind us and that the COVID-19 has already peaked, opening the path for resumption of normal life.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">GCC markets on the other hand had to deal with twin crisis of COVID-19 and oil price crash. COVID-19 led fall in demand for oil and price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia resulted in the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude to trade at negative $37 per barrel on 20th April 2020. With an agreement reached at a later stage between Russia and Saudi Arabia for production cuts, the oil has bounced back to certain extent. Recovery in oil prices and re-opening of economies in a phased manner led to recovery in the GCC stock markets, however Dubai, Bahrain and Kuwait are still lagging with YTD returns of worse than -15%.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Given the impact that the lockdown measures had on businesses, many sectors are expected to report declining profitability and have announced culling of dividends. In this scenario, the disconnect looks to widen with every bounce of recovery in the stock markets. Overall, although the situation looks to be improving, caution needs to be practised, as experts warn against the second wave of coronavirus, which could spill more troubles for the economies and markets in the near future.</p>

<blockquote><strong>Conclusion</strong>
Economies reeling under the COVID crisis needs to take cues from Internationally, acclaimed success stories in terms of lockdown exit options. Among them are countries like South Korea and Taiwan. Some of the common themes emerging from these models include –
- Ramping up testing and deploying technology to better understand local spread or epidemiology, meticulous contact tracing and testing, and collating data to provide tailored insights to communities.
- Greater use of location-specific or cluster-oriented measures instead of blanket lockdowns.
- Methodically following legacy measures such as social distancing, restrictions on mass gatherings, etc., while enforcing sanitation (e.g., use of facemasks in public spaces).

With respect to the GCC, a phased opening may be suitable. A preparatory phase can commence with lockdown de-escalation with minor easing of people movement restrictions, including permitting personal daily walks and physical exercises with prescribed time slots for residents to leave their homes. Then, some businesses can be allowed to reopen, but with appointments only, with people aged over 65 as part of <strong>‘vulnerability shielding’.</strong></blockquote>[:]]]></Content>

		<Title>[:en]COVID-19: GCC has mostly resorted to monetary measures[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">The COVID-19 led health and economic crisis has pushed many governments around the world to respond with a wide armor of fiscal and monetary actions that far exceed the measures taken in the past when the Global Financial Crisis happened in 2009. The measures were announced in a quick and concerted manner across the developed countries, emerging countries, and less developed countries. GCC countries also acted with alacrity in providing stimulus measures:</p>

<ul class="rdetails_list">
 	<li style="text-align: left;">to meet the COVID-19 Impact that hit them with lower global Oil prices,</li>
 	<li style="text-align: left;">economic output fall in various sectors of the non-oil economy consequent to lockdowns imposed on citizen movements and production and service facilities to limit the spread of the virus; and</li>
 	<li style="text-align: left;">lower trade resulting from COVID-19 impact on the economies of their trade partners.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Types of stimulus measures provided by economies world over</strong>
The economic stimulus measures across the globe comprised of monetary policy measures like interest rate cuts, Central Bank liquidity support, Central Bank swap lines, and Central Bank asset purchase programs of both Government securities as well as corporate bond purchases by the United States. Financial policy stimulus measures were easing banks’ capital buffers, capital adequacy ratios, liquidity requirements, risk weights for some asset categories and provisioning requirements. Stimulus actions also included direct cash transfers to citizens in lower income categories and financial reliefs for borrowers in the form of postponement/ moratorium for instalments and interest, restructuring of loans and credit guarantees support. Lastly, the measures included administrative/ regulatory measures like extending deadlines for compliances and submissions of tax and other government payments, waiver of various types of government and bank fees etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Size of COVID-19 stimulus measures across the World</strong>
The total global monetary and fiscal measures to fight COVID-19 Impact are estimated at USD 20.4 trillion comprising Central Bank liquidity injection of USD 10.4 trillion and government fiscal stimulus of USD 10.0 trillion. These stimulus measures provided by major countries are as shown in the table below:</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>GCC countries mainly provided monetary stimulus restrained by budgetary deficits</strong>
The GCC countries are impacted internally by economic lockdown to counter COVID-19 as well as by the external impact from COVID-19 influence global economies that led to sharp fall in oil Prices. Consequently, the GCC economies are expected to face large budgetary deficits in 2020. However, this may not be new to GCC countries, which faced a similar crisis though of somewhat lesser proportion in 2009 and 2016 when oil prices plummeted. To stave off a hit to their non-oil sectors to the extent manageable they announced a string of measures in the form of fiscal stimulus, monetary stimulus, cash supports, and regulatory measures targeted at the non-oil sectors.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Bulk of GCC countries stimulus is through monetary measures</strong>
The GCC countries have provided large monetary stimulus packages in the form of Central Bank interest rate cuts by almost all the countries and liquidity support to its banks in the form of reduction in liquidity ratios, capital adequacy ratios and risk weights for some category of assets like MSMEs and higher lending ratios to their important non-oil sectors like real estate.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Saudi Arabian Monetary agency (SAMA) provided USD 13.3 billion support to banks for funding the private sector particularly SMEs. In addition, SAMA is supporting banks to defer loan instalments by three months. Central Bank of UAE has provided monetary stimulus of USD 70 billion (17.4 % of GDP) to the banks and credit guarantees and allowed deferral of loan instalments until end 2020. Qatar Central Bank is providing support for extending loan instalment deferral to borrowers for six months. Central Bank of Kuwait has provided Monetary stimulus in the form of lower Liquidity ratio and lower Capital Adequacy Ratio to release funds (estimated at around USD 16 billion) to fund deferral of loan instalments for individuals and for affected borrowers for six months, subsidized funding for SMEs and extend additional loans to borrowers. Central Bank of Oman has extended Liquidity support of USD 20.3 billion (27.3% of GDP) to the banks which will fund the deferral of loan instalments for borrowers for six months and extend additional lending to borrowers. Central Bank of Bahrain has extended Liquidity measures of USD 9.8 billion (28.7% of GDP) to meet funding for deferral of loan instalments for borrowers for six months and provide new loans.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Other stimulus measures provided by GCC countries</strong>
Saudi Arabia provided other measures like wage benefits to companies, utility subsidies, and suspension of some government taxes and fees. UAE also announced electrical and water subsidies, among others. Kuwait set up a USD 31 million fund to combat COVID-19. Qatar is providing exemption of rent payments and utility payments and salaries to quarantined migrant labor. Oman has waived port and airfreight charges and rent payments in industrial zones. Bahrain waived electricity and water bills for Bahraini individuals and companies, social benefits to low income Bahraini families and payments to unemployed Bahrainis in the private sector.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Overall, their strained budgetary position may explain GCC countries’ comparatively much smaller size of COVID-19 fiscal stimulus measures.</p>[:]]]></Content>

		<Title>[:en]COVID-19 may force GCC companies to cut dividend payout[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">Dividend payments have been an important tool to get investors to buy shares of companies as dividends provide a return on investment even during periods when the markets are down. GCC Companies listed on stock exchanges have provided consistent dividends in recent years. Due to Covid-19, many GCC Companies may be forced to cut dividend payouts due to fall in earnings and need to preserve cash. We examine the impact on dividends due to the pandemic and its ramifications for the stock market.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Dividend Payouts have been high for GCC stock markets.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Exhibit 1: Dividend payout ratios and yields of GCC Stock market indices</strong>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Among-Many-Dividends-can-be-one-of-the-Causalities-in-the-GCC-Exhibit-1.jpg" alt="Results of Social Media Poll – Returns expectation for Saudi Arabia 2020-2024" width="800" height="762" /><span style="color: #696969; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;">Source: Refinitiv; Note: Dividend Payout Ratio is the ratio of dividends paid and net income</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As seen from the exhibit above, companies listed on GCC stock indices tend to have high dividend payout ratios at more than 50% for many GCC indices. One of the reasons is that GCC governments hold a significant stake in these companies and dividend payments contribute to government revenues. High dividend payouts have been crucial to get GCC and foreign investors to invest in the GCC stock markets. Therefore, any news of dividend cuts could lead to a selloff in the markets.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Speculation of dividend cuts triggered a selloff in Kuwaiti Banks</strong>
Kuwaiti Banks listed on the Boursa Kuwait fell between 5-10% on June 10 following news reports that implied that the Kuwaiti Banking Association (KBA) had asked their members not to pay cash dividends for FY2020. The Central Bank of Kuwait had previously announced Covid-19 combatting measures as part of its Regulatory Stimulus Package, including reduction of the Capital Adequacy Ratio floor by 2.5% and more relaxed liquidity requirements. If a bank makes use of these concessions, according to Basel III rules it will have to forego paying cash dividends. Speculation on whether Kuwaiti banks would opt for the concessions and the need to forgo paying dividends led to a selloff. The banks later clarified that a final decision regarding the 2020 dividend will be made at the year-end, based on financial performance, the extent to whether the bank has made use of the above central bank concessions, the recommendation of the Board of Directors and the wishes of the shareholders. The Capital Markets Authority then cancelled the trades made on June 10 since the KBA was not authorized to issue the communication. Still, the incident shows the importance of dividends to investors.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Earnings impact is likely to constraint dividend paying capability</strong>
The IMF has estimated that all GCC Countries would see contraction in GDP for 2020. Measures to contain the spread of coronavirus and the ensuing lockdown and curfew measures is bound to impact the earnings of companies. Based on our analysis, a 20 to 30 percent fall in income levels, would severely impact the dividend paying capability of firms in Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Qatar and Oman. While those in Kuwait and Bahrain would be impacted as well. Companies in Dubai due to their low pay out ratios could weather the fall in earnings and could maintain the dividends.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>GCC Sectors most likely to cut dividends</strong>
Banks and Financial stocks constitute a significant portion of GCC Indices with financials comprising 52% of S&P GCC Composite index. Due to Covid-19 and the need to conserve liquidity, many central banks have already placed restrictions on 2019 dividend distributions. And the IMF has also called for banks to not pay cash dividends to preserve capital in the banking system and also prevent weaker institutions from being stigmatised. In light of this, dividend cuts are to be expected for GCC banks though a final decision will be probably be taken on a bank-to-bank basis based on the extent of increase in bad loans leading to reduction in capital ratios. The possibility of dividend cuts also explains why even the strongest Banks and Financial institutions have seen big falls in share prices.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Exhibit 3: Sector wise Dividend payout ratios and Yields for Kuwait </strong>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Among-Many-Dividends-can-be-one-of-the-Causalities-in-the-GCC-Exhibit-3.jpg" alt="Results of Social Media Poll – Returns expectation for Saudi Arabia 2020-2024" width="800" height="762" /><span style="color: #696969; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;">Source: Refinitiv</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Kuwaiti Companies in Basic Materials sector have a dividend payout ratio above 100% indicating that they have been paying dividends using cash from their reserves in addition to the cash from profits. Other sectors like Oil & Gas, Basic materials & Industrials together constitute 25% of S&P GCC Composite. Covid-19 and the oil price crash will result in significant earnings fall for these sectors and certain cuts in dividends. This leaves defensive stocks as the most likely to keep their dividend payout rates. The crisis might even result in these sectors reporting more profits and increase in dividends. However, since they comprise a small part of GCC stock markets, the impact is likely to be minimal.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Conclusion</strong>
As the second quarter ends and GCC companies start reporting their results, a clearer picture on dividends is likely to emerge. As seen from the example of Basic materials sector in Kuwait, dividend policy was not necessarily dependant on profits and more on satisfying shareholders. However, due to the liquidity crunch caused by Covid-19, companies with adequate cash balances and banks with healthier capital ratios are likely to maintain dividends, which will give them an advantage compared to the market as a whole.</p>[:]]]></Content>

		<Title>[:en]COVID-19 brings to the fore GCC’s Fiscal Vulnerability[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">Revenue from oil forms significant portion of overall revenue for GCC countries, with 20-year(2000-2019) average at 74%. This dependence on oil as revenue source has long been a pain point for GCC’s fiscal position, surfacing during periods of low oil prices and receding during periods of high oil price.In the backdrop of fall in oil prices due to COVID-19, building a sustainable fiscal policy in GCC has resumed higher importance.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Ascend to Prosperity</strong>
Referred to as black gold, oil has propelled GCC economies to prosperity. Oil prices have been on the rise from 2000 to 2008supported by rise in globalization and high growth in countries like India and China.After a blip in prices due to global financial crisis in the 2009, economic recovery on the demand side and geopolitical tensions stressing thesupply side sustained high oil prices until 2014.This period has been quite favourable for the GCC countries in terms of building up assets and flourishing as welfare states.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Figure 1: Growth in total foreign assets of GCC countries</strong>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Growth-in-total-foreign-assets-of-GCC-countries.jpg" alt="Growth in total foreign assets of GCC countries" width="800" height="762" /><span style="color: #696969; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;">Source: IIF</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Fiscal Vulnerability</strong>
While the reserves of GCC countries continued to increase in line with revenues, so did the government’s expenditure bills. Over the period 2000-2013, while total revenue for all of GCC increased at CAGR of 12.9%, total expenditure increased at a CAGR of 13.1%. The expenditure as percentage of GDP in GCC is higher than the EMs and other oil importers(IMF -2017). GCC’s fiscal policy was also skewed towards current expenditure, particularly wages and subsidies. This pattern of expenditure made the GCC economies vulnerable in two ways – first, the expenses were based on oil prices, an unstable revenue source; second, less focus on capital expenditure implied minimal economic diversification and continued reliance on oil.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Figure 2: Expenditure break up of GCC countries(2010-2020f)</strong>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Expenditure-break-up-of-GCC-countries2010-2020f.jpg" alt="Expenditure break up of GCC countries(2010-2020f)" width="800" height="762" /><span style="color: #696969; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;">Source: IIF</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On the back of increase in shale oil supply and slowdown in economies like China, oil prices started to fall in 2014 and reached their trough in 2016. With fall in revenues and elevated expenditure levels, all GCC countries, except Kuwait, posted fiscal deficit from 2015-2017. Kuwait had managed to return to surplus in 2016, from fiscal deficit in 2015, by reducing current expenditure.There was considerable increase in government debt for the GCC countries by 2016. While some countries across the world do run on deficit budgets, vulnerability of GCCs’ fiscal position arises from its lack of stable revenue base and singular dependence on oil revenues.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Periods of rising oil prices from 2000-13, did provide an opportunity to diversify into a non-oil economy and increase job opportunities. Though efforts had been made to improve non-oil economy such asnational development plans enabling diversification through infrastructure development and improving ease of doing business to promote private sector growth, much more had been required to have fully capitalised on the period of high revenue.
After the 2016 crash, though prices recovered, they did not touch pre-crash levels. But government expenditure continued to remain high. For example, in Kuwait,it is difficult to rein inexpenses on wages and subsidies that form a major portion of total expenditure. This has left the economies much weaker to face COVID-19 and resultant fall in prices, than they were before the 2014-16 crash.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Challenges due to COVID-19</strong>
COVID-19 hashighlighted the vulnerabilities in the fiscal position of GCC countries.</p>

<ul class="rdetails_list">
 	<li style="text-align: left;">COVID-19 has brought out a dual crisis. On the one hand, there is increased expenditure on measures to contain spread of the virus and on fiscal stimulus to provide support to livelihoods and businesses affected by the lockdown. On the other, revenues have been affected by the fall in oil prices on the back of lockdown measures to contain spread of COVID-19.</li>
 	<li style="text-align: left;">Uncertainty over duration of COVID-19 also contributes to uncertainty over the fiscal health of the GCC countries and makes their fiscal planning difficult.</li>
 	<li style="text-align: left;">Moving away from oil would require significant investments in the non-oil sector. As revenues fall due to low oil prices, the inclination and the ability in making such investments is curtailed. For example, in 2014-16, significant cuts were made in capital expenditure.</li>
 	<li style="text-align: left;">Additionally, in the face of COVID-19, non-oil sectors have also slumped and might take time to recover despite investments. For example, tourism was one of the thrust areas amongst non-oil sectors. But with travel restrictions,the sector has been severely impacted.</li>
 	<li style="text-align: left;">With the current period of low oil prices coinciding with a global recession, fiscal consolidation has to be balanced against growth and employment considerations.With livelihoods of people already affected by COVID-19, implementing cuts to wages and subsidies might not be viewed favourably.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The way forward</strong>
The future of oil has become more uncertain in the face of COVID-19. Changes brought about by COVID-19 in terms of reduced globalisation as supply chains are being localised,less travelling due work from home and video-conferencing and shift towards cleaner energy sources might impact demand for oil.There are also forecasts of high, though unsustainable, oil prices. This is based on the cyclical nature of the industry, wherein oil production cuts during period of low prices cause deficit, thereby pushing up prices of the commodity.
However, there is wide consensus that global oil demand is set to decline in the long term, re-iterating need forfiscal reforms.Expenditure cuts by Kuwait, Oman etc. and tripling of value added tax by Saudi Arabia are some of the recent measures undertaken by the countries to shore up finances.Other measures that could be implemented are,
<strong>1. Reducing current Expenditure</strong>
a. Targeted subsidy programs to the truly needy, while being effective would also reduce burden on state finances. The subsidies and transfers could also be anchored to oil revenue until a more stable revenue system like taxation is implemented.
b. Reforms to reduce burden of the wages bills on budget by reducing premium on public sector wages, restructuring of public sector, encouraging and facilitating private sector employment etc.
<strong>2. Sustained implementation of consolidation measures is important.</strong> 
While the countries had implemented expenditure cuts during oil price crash of 2014-16, the reduction was sustained only by Qatar. This is observed particularly in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, where the current expenditure in 2019 is estimated to be up by 23.5% and 6.6% from their 2014 levels.
<strong>3. Diversifying into non-oil economy driven by private sector</strong>
a. Capital expenditure has seen significant decline since 2014, except in Kuwait and Qatar. This reduction in capital spending has more pronounced negative impact on growth. Hence, investments could be channelled intorevenue-generating non-oil sectors.
b. A drawdown from GCC countries’ considerable reserves toprop up the economy could be considered.
c. Public Private Partnerships and Foreign Direct Investments could aid in private sector growth.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While periods of high oil prices provide less incentive to diversify, periods of low oil prices provide less room to do so. Exiting this vicious cycle would ensure sustainable growth to prosperity in GCC. The current times reinforce the urgency of reforms and could aid in hastening their implementation.</p>[:]]]></Content>

		<Title>[:en]How has liquidity in Saudi Tadawul fared during COVID-19?[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">Liquidity is one of the key indicators of a stock market and is a fundamental requirement for market efficiency. In recent years, Saudi Arabia’s equity market has implemented reforms, such as relaxation of foreign ownership and has achieved milestones such as inclusion in key indices including the MSCI Emerging Market Indices. With the listing of Saudi Aramco, it has also become one of the top 10 markets globally, by market capitalization. Given the market’s importance in GCC and globally, the impact of COVID-19 on its liquidity has been analysed in this article.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With the economy still reeling under the impact of COVID-19, the equities market has continued to rally from their March 2020 lows. While the Tadawul Index had fallen by about 29% year-to-date in March, it was up by 21.2% on 30th of June, supported by stimulus measures and easing of lockdowns.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">During periods of stability, the liquidity remains fairly constant. During times of stress, the stock market could either be characterised by high or low liquidity(IMF). Under the impact of COVID-19, since March, liquidity both in terms of value traded and turnover ratio has increased year on year, except for May. The decline in liquidity in May could be due to the austerity measures such as tripling of VAT and suspension of cost of living allowance announced during the month.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to improve liquidity in the economy could have contributed to the increased liquidity in the stock market. The decline in yields in bond markets might have also caused equities to be in favour, spurring ‘buy-at-lows’ sentiment among investors. The increase in liquidity is driven mostly by retail participation. Liquidity, in terms of value traded, in sectors such as software services, energy, consumer services and consumer durables have increased year-on-year during Apr-Jun 2020. Sectors such as banks, media and entertainment and utilities have seen decline in liquidity.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Foreign flows have dropped in 2020 compared to 2019. It could be due to base effect of higher inflows in around mid-2019 as Saudi Arabia was included in the MSCI Emerging Market Indices in May 2019. The onset of COVID-19 and the fall in oil prices due to disagreement between Saudi Arabia and Russia on OPEC+ deal had caused a fund outflow of USD 700 mn in March 2020. However, with buoyancy back in markets on the back of stimulus measures and with easing of lockdowns and OPEC+ production cuts supporting oil prices, foreign flows have recovered.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">According to the Saudi Capital Market Authority, the first half of 2020 has seen a year-on-year increase of 25% in number of IPO requests, a 50% increase in the requests for flotation for a market growth and 200% rise in capital increase requests for listed companies, compared to the first half of 2019. Despite COVID-19’s negative impact on the real economy and uncertainty over the recovery, the equity market has recovered from March lows and is showing an increasing trend in liquidity. The sustainability of the trend is in question as risks such as a slower recovery, a second wave of COVID-19, persist. However, if the trend does continue, liquidity is likely to sustain at reasonable levels.</p>

		<Title>[:en]Defensive sectors in GCC-A great bet in today’s times[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">The 2020 stock market crash due to Covid-19 has been fast and short, if the markets do not fall to the lows of March 2020 again. The Oil price crash and social distancing measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 has impacted sectors in the GCC in different ways.This can be observed in the current level of GCC Sector Indices. We make a comparison of the current levels of GCC sector indices with that of 52-week high and 52-week lowto check which sectorsare good bets in these uncertain times.</p>

[caption id="attachment_4789" align="alignnone" width="800"]<a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/kuwait-luxury-retail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="wp-image-4789" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kuwait-Luxury-Retail_Blog_Ad.jpg" alt="Kuwait Luxury Retail" width="800" height="200" /></a> Ad: Marmore Research Report[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Exhibit 1: GCC Sector Indices along with their 52 week High and 52 week low</strong>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Defensive-sectors-in-GCC-A-great-bet-in-today’s-times-fig1.jpg" alt="GCC Sector Indices along with their 52 week High and 52 week low" width="800" height="762" />

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Real estate, Banks & Financials and Energy indices have seen huge falls</strong>
As a region with a primarily oil-based economy, GCC equity markets have been affected by the Oil price crash. This has resulted in a huge fall for the GCC Energy index which has fallen 17.2% for the year till date (YTD). However, the lockdowns, interest payment deferrals and travel restrictions instituted by the GCC nations to contain the spread of COVID-19 have affected the Real estate (down 22.4% YTD) and Financials (down 19.7% YTD) indices by even greater levels. Since these sectors constitute a significant percentage of the S&P GCC Composite, the whole index has been affected.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Are Defensive Sectors a great bet during these times?</strong>
The downturn has increased the need for fund managers and investors to look at defensive stocks. Defensive stocks are those which perform well even during periods of crisis. Defensive stocks generally provide stable earnings inspite of the underlying economic conditions. Their businesses also tend to provide products or services that are in demand even during recessions. Examples of such sectors are consumer staples, consumer discretionary and Utilities. We can observe that the GCC Non-Cyclicals index trades at very close to the 52 week high and has also gained 33% YTD as against the S&P GCC composite index which has fallen 15.2% YTD. This indicates that defensives are a great investment bet in uncertain times.</p>

<blockquote><a href="https://www.databook.marmoremena.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong> Did You Know? </strong>

<p style="text-align: left;">Other sectors which can be considered to be defensives like telecom have also outperformed the S&P GCC composite index with the GCC telecom index only being down 1.2% for the year and trading very close to the 52 week high. With increased internet data usage due to people being confined to their homes during the lockdown, telecom companies are expected to benefit from the crisis. In the long run also, with e-learning and work from home expected to increase, telecom sector is also expected to outperform the market.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Another index to significantly outperform the S&P GCC Composite is the GCC Healthcare index which has fallen by 3.2% YTD. The Covid-19 pandemic has seen an increased focus on the healthcare sector in the near term. The long term prospects for the sector also look good as GCC Governments are likely to increase healthcare spendingeven after the pandemic ends.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Defensive sectors constitute a relatively small portion of the S&P GCC composite index</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Exhibit 2: Sectoral Breakdown of S&P GCC Composite index</strong>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Defensive-sectors-in-GCC-A-great-bet-in-today’s-times-fig2.jpg" alt="Sectoral Breakdown of S&P GCC Composite index" width="800" height="762" />
<span style="color: #696969; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;">Source: S&P Indices</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, the weightage for Defensive sectors is low at 17.6% in the S&P GCC Composite with Communication Services (9.6%), Consumer Staples(3%), Consumer Discretionary(2.3%), Utilities (1.7%) and Healthcare(1%). The Covid-19 crisis and outperformance of these sectors could result in these sectors getting a higher weightage which can further result in further out-performance in the future. This could also encourage un-listed companies in these sectors to consider IPOs as they observe their listed peers outperform the market. The market too needs an adequate number of defensive stocks as they can offer support during downturns and prevent investors,particularly institutional investors from leaving the markets entirely.</p>

		<Title>[:en]Estimating Corporate CapEx in Saudi Arabia[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]COVID-19 has been a double whammy for the Saudi Arabian economy. First, the lockdown and curfew measures has affected the economic activity. Second, because of global lockdown, oil prices fell with the demand for oil falling sharply. Therefore, the output of Saudi corporate sector is also expected to be very much low for the year 2020 if not beyond.

<strong>Average Fixed Capital Assets held by Saudi Listed Companies(2015-2019)</strong>
Saudi listed companies held fixed capital assets measured by the average outstanding investment in plant property & equipment (PPE) of USD 670 billion during the period 2015-2019. A bulk of this was accounted by Saudi Aramco to the extent of USD 216 billion (2016-19).

<strong>Figure-1: Fixed Capital Assets (USD billion) held by Saudi Listed Corporates (2015-19 average)</strong>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Fixed-Capital-Assets-held-by-Saudi-Listed-Corporates.jpg" alt="Fixed Capital Assets (USD billion) held by Saudi Listed Corporates" width="800" height="762" />
<span style="color: #696969; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;">Source: Reuters, Marmore Analysis</span></p>

<strong>Average Productivity of Fixed Capital Assets during (2015-2019)</strong>
To measure the utilization of the assets,the average EBITDA to PPE ratio for the historical period of 2015-2019 was computed, which can be interpreted as the productivity of the fixed assets. The average EBITDA to PPE ratio for the listed companies was 0.35 with the ratio for Saudi Aramco the largest company being the highest at 0.90. Chemicals (that includes SABIC)the next largest sector had a very low ratio of 0.11, and Electric Utilities the next by size had a ratio of only 0.04 while Telecommunications was better at 0.15. Oil & Gas (excl. Aramco) comprising of refinery products also had a very low ratio of 0.05 due to the losses being incurred by some oil refineries. The ratios for the remaining sectors can be seen from Figure 2.

[caption id="attachment_4789" align="alignnone" width="800"]<a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/equity-market-return-expectations-for-saudi-arabia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="wp-image-4789" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CME-Saudi_800x420_Learn-more.jpg" alt="Equity Market Return Expectations for Saudi Arabia, 2020 – 2024" width="800" height="200" /></a> Ad: Marmore Research Report[/caption]

The high ratio for Saudi Aramco shows the low oil production cost for the firm and the low ratio for Electric Utilities shows the long life of these assets, which leads to lower yearly ROA and low profits for the sector due to below market electricity prices in the Kingdom. Telecommunications being a profitable local business the sector’s ratio was better than the ratio for chemicals which is a highly competitive global business. Shipping business again being a very competitive long-life asset business generates low yearly ROA and hence the ratio was very low.

<strong>Average Utilization of Fixed Capital Assets during (2020CY)</strong>
The average utilization of the assets generated by the different sectors is estimated by computing the potential EBITDA that should be generated in 2020CY using historical EBITDA to PPE ratio and comparing it with the estimated EBITDA by sector according to Mamore’s Saudi Economic forecast model for 2020CY factoring in COVID Impact, lower oil production and lower oil prices. The computations show that the overall utilization of assets (average for the companies studied) is expected to be as low as 54% for the year 2020CY. The utilization is most severely affected for Saudi Aramco (48%), rest of the Oil & Gas (51%), and Chemicals (66%). On the other hand, Telecommunications is little affected (91%) and Electric Utilities are expected to be unaffected (101%). The utilization percentages for other sectors are shown in Figure-3.

As Aramco is impacted by both lower oil demand and prices both internationally as well as domestically and hence it shows below average utilization. As COVID-19 is not expected to have impacted them much, Telecommunications and Electric Utilities are expected to show marginally lower or better fixed asset utilization in 2020. Chemicals sector is expected to be better than Oil & Gas, but it will still show lower asset utilization due to lower demand and lower margins on sales. Other sectors with below average asset utilization are expected to be other Oil & Gas sector, Oil & Gas equipment and related sectors, construction, pharmaceuticals (due to expected output loss as it is based on overall manufacturing sector output loss), and other sectors.

<strong>What is expected about Fixed Asset Additions by Saudi Listed Companies for 2021CY</strong>
The underutilization of fixed assets by Saudi Listed companies in 2020CY is expected to impact the capital expenditure outlays for 2020CY as well as that for 2021. It is expected that despite the better economic prospects for 2021 with hopefully no second wave resulting in additional lockdowns and recovery of economic output, the need for higher fixed assets can be expected to arise in 2021. However, the lower profits in 2020CY is expected to constrain companies from taking up large capital expenditures in 2020CY despite the optimism of demand in 2021. 

No doubt, the overhang of lower utilization of assets added in 2019 but not utilized in 2020 due to COVID-19 will also deter fixed asset additions in 2020. Some companies that are not fully leveraged can borrow to invest if 2021 prospects brighten. Others facing borrowing constraints and lower cash generation might have to reduce capital expenditures unless they raise equity to meet the shortfall. However,overall, not all companies will be able to invest in fixed assets comparable to that done in 2019. Therefore, the lower capital expenditure programs in 2020 can be expected to impact companies from capitalizing fully any demand upsurge in 2021 due to pent up demand consequent to the COVID-19 caused demand disruption in 2020. Which are the companies that will benefit consequently, and which are the ones that must yield to loosing market shares locally or internationally is the moot question.

		<Title>[:en]Will COVID-19 increase the Cost of Capital in the GCC?[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">Cost of Capital represents the opportunity cost of all financial capital, primarily debt and equity, invested in an enterprise. ‘Opportunity cost’ also referred to as ‘hurdle cost’ or ‘discount rate’, is of primary importance in valuation and helps investors in arriving at the correct price of a company’s stock. Given the importance of this metric in creating value for shareholders, it is essential to compare the cost of capital for the GCC countries over the years.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Key Points to be noted</strong></p>

<ul class="rdetails_list" style="text-align: left;">
 	<li style="text-align: left;">Cost of Capital depends on the risk free rate (RFR) of the country. The RFR is usually taken as the yield of 10-year treasury bonds issued by the particular country.</li>
 	<li style="text-align: left;">Cost of Capital also depends on the equity risk premium (ERP) which is the premium expected by the market for investing in equities since equities are riskier than bonds.</li>
 	<li style="text-align: left;">COVID-19 has resulted in risk free rates coming down and equity risk premiums going up as investors eschew risk and seek the safety of government bonds.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Weighted Average Cost of Capital in the GCC over the years</b>

The progression of the WACC for GCC countries from H1 2017 to H1 2020 is shown in the exhibit below.

<p style="text-align: left;">Since H1 2017, the WACC has witnessed a decline for Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Qatar and Kuwait with the WACC for H1 2020 being the lowest. The opposite trend is observed for Bahrain and Oman with WACC continuously increasing each year. Both countries had been affected by low oil prices since 2014 and COVID-19 has worsened the situation. The WACC for Dubai while seeing a mild decline in H1 2020 has been within a tight range for the past four years.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Equity Risk Premium</strong>
The easy way to calculate ERP is to find the difference between historic long-term return of equity index and the risk-free investment, such as government bonds. However, this methodology has its drawbacks especially for emerging and frontier countries like the GCC region. Due to this we use alternative methods like Sovereign rating, CDS Spreads and Implied ERP to estimate the ERP for GCC countries.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For Sovereign rating method, the ERP of GCC countries are arrived at by adding the U.S market’s equity risk premium (ERP) of 6.01% and the default spread based on their credit rating. In the CDS Spreads method, the ERP is obtained by adding the CDS spread of a country’s bond to the US ERP of 6.01%. In the Implied equity risk premium approach we assume that stocks are correctly priced and by estimating the internal rate of return (IRR) and subtracting out the risk free rate from IRR should yield an implied equity risk premium.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The average ERP for all GCC countries had increased in H1 2020 from that of H1 2019 mainly due to a higher implied ERP on account of lowered GDP growth estimates leading to a fall in stock index values in all GCC countries since the outbreak of COVID-19 in January. Also, the increase in US ERP from 5.3% in 2019 to 6.01% in 2020 contributed to the increase. The increase in ERP has been much higher for Bahrain and Oman due to successive downgrades increasing the ERP calculated through the Ratings method and CDS Spreads methods also.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>WACC computed using the three methods (H1 2020)</strong>
For GCC countries except for Bahrain and Oman, the WACC for H1 2020 decreased due to fall in risk free rate (RFR)as a result of monetary easing and their credit ratings remaining unchanged. The decrease in the RFR was more than the increase in the ERP for those countries. Oman and Bahrain, due to credit rating downgrades saw high risk free rates of 6.7% and 5.5% which failed to compensate for the increase in ERP and consequently the WACC increased for them.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Conclusion</strong>
The COVID-19 crisis has negatively impacted GCC countries with fiscal woes like Bahrain and Oman with their cost of capital increasing since the outbreak. The other GCC Countries, with investment-grade credit ratings, have seen their risk free rate decrease, which has reduced the weighted average cost of capital in those countries, despite the fall in equity markets in H1 2020 increasing the equity risk premium. The gradual relaxation of lockdown restrictions and loose monetary policies have seen equity markets worldwide making a sustained recovery in Q3 2020 and the GCC stock markets were no exception. Currently (as on October 7), Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul Index is down only 0.4% YTD. This stock market recovery would result in reduction of the implied ERP. However, the Cost of capital in H1 2021 for GCC would depend on the extent of the wider economic recovery in terms of GDP growth, control of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the equity markets continuing their recovery.</p>

		<Title>[:en]Online Education for School Children in the GCC[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">As children and parents in the GCC get a taste of remote schooling due to the impact of COVID-19, there are multiple themes emerging. It is a given that learner cohorts are very different, which means that felicity with computers vary significantly. Remote learning, especially for young children, is a complex affair due to the influx of technologies,various software, and communication capabilities of stakeholders involved.

The GCC education sector’s response to COVID-19 quarantine needs to be judged objectively. It is natural that concerns around grading and national tests will raise significant challenges. Also, a deeply fundamental concern is that some parents or guardians may not be in a position to support their wards in their daily classes and learning effectively. This could breed academic inequalities.

Teachers scrambled to find methods to continue teaching effectively in a situation wherein no physical presence is possible. Obviously, not all teachers will be tech-savvy. Increased screen time for children is another major concern.However, due to technology, ‘personalized learning’ as a concept could raise, as real-time data (like regular submission of assignments) can all now get catalogued.

There is the need to understand how students can tap the potential of online remote learning solutions, so that appropriate guidance can be developed and disseminated. Teachers will be under continuous pressure to think creatively about their own roles as enablers of student learning and to evaluate multiple ideas for implementation (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development). To really understand the experiences and the impact on students and parents in the GCC, a roadmap is required.

<blockquote><a href="https://www.databook.marmoremena.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong> Did You Know? </strong>

Technology-integration for supporting educational requirements will be uneven across the GCC. In fact, divergences will persist in terms of availability of essential digital infrastructure and fundamental digital competences. In fact, a wide-ranging consultation process can help gather the views of multiple stakeholders, so that a common vision can be drafted.

Televisions have also gained an important role. For e.g., at the start of the virtual schools in Saudi Arabia in March 2020, about 20 broadcasting channels were dedicated to offer academic school lessons from 8:00 am to 12:30 pm, with alternative feeds available on YouTube too (Asharq Al-Awsat).

As part of advance preparation before introducing virtual schooling in March 2020, the UAE Ministry of Education conducted a one-week remote professional training for over 25,000 government school teachers and administrators, apart from 9,200 private school teachers and principals(UAE).New roles are coming into play as well. For e.g., Bahrain School, one of the earliest private schools in Bahrain, deployed an Educational Technologist (ET) who worked closely with subject matter experts to create the technological platforms customized to the needs of the students and teachers (Bahrain News Agency).

Experts point out that technology works best when teachers are equipped with digital capability and enjoy adequate training. GCC schools will need a vision to galvanize their offerings in terms of embedding innovative practices. The GCC’s education system is part of a digitally enabled ecosystem where a sound strategy will be the first step in driving better student engagement and academic attainment in a virtual environment.</p>

		<Title>[:en]COVID-19 derails traditional Kuwait retailers[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">Kuwait’s retail sector is small in absolute terms when compared to regional peers like the UAE or Saudi Arabia. However, Kuwait has one of the highest concentrations of international retailers in the GCC, with luxury segment proving to be a major draw. The value of Kuwait’s retail market was KD 3.5bn or 9.1% of non-oil GDP, as of February 2018 (Oxford Business Group). Consumer preference towards international brands and better retail shopping experiences were exhibiting an upward trend until COVID-19 turned the fortunes of retail markets upside down. Although long term indicators suggest an eventual recovery followed by growth, the near-term impact might put a lot of retailers out of business. Kuwait enjoys the benefits of being one of the highest per capita income countries in the world and approximately has 45% of population in the 20 to 39 age brackets, and these young consumers have a high inclination towards retail spending malls, and in the purchase of international brands.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Short term impact of COVID-19</strong>
COVID-19 has forced the government to enforce strict social distancing measures. These measures have not only affected the current state of things but also have deeper implications for the future. The Lockdown affected all retail operations except grocery and pharmacy. All malls and outlets were shut down. Luxury and Franchise based retailers like Alshaya saw sales decrease by 95% overnight. The government which began relaxing restrictions in phases from June 1 onwards, allowed malls and retail outlets to reopen from August 1. However even once re-opened, luxury and franchise based retailers are unlikely to return to original sales as customers would be reluctant to spend as before due to the economic slowdown. In addition, the enforced shift in customer preference towards online purchases is expected to familiarize new customers, who are likely to stick to online modes of purchases.</p>


[caption id="attachment_4789" align="alignnone" width="800"]<a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/kuwait-luxury-retail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="wp-image-4789" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kuwait-Luxury-Retail_Blog_Ad.jpg" alt="Kuwait Luxury Retail" width="800" height="200" /></a> Ad: Marmore Research Report[/caption]
<p style="text-align: left;">Based on a back of the envelope calculations by Marmore Kuwait’s per capita household expenditure is expected to fall by 34% in 2020CY compared to the previous year. Retail sales are also expected to mirror the trend. The impact on retail sales of various products is summarised below:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/COVID-19-derails-traditional-Kuwait-retailers.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="762" />
<span style="color: #696969; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;">Source: Marmore Analysis</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Labour availability has also become a key challenge for the retail sector as many migrants have moved back to their home countries. Kuwait heavily relies on expats for labour and many of them could be retrenched to cut employee costs. However, hiring them back when malls reopen again would be a difficult task if the expats do not return from their home countries. Additionally, Kuwait’s cabinet has approved the bill to add quotas to limit the maximum number of expats from a single country. As certain nationalities like Indians are much more prevalent than others, dislocation of labour will cause near term disruptions that will extend the pain for the retail sector.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Even after normalcy resumes, customers would be unwilling to spend as they did pre-crisis once things come back to normal due to the economic impact of the pandemic. The general slowdown of discretionary spending will be a pain point for retailers to contend with for the next few years. Retailers of essential goods would be in a much comfortable position compared to luxury and discretionary product retailers. Retailers with robust infrastructure to fulfil online orders and pure e-commerce players could be longer-term beneficiaries, placing a greater emphasis on the shift towards a flexible multi-channel retail model.</p>

<blockquote><a href="https://www.databook.marmoremena.com/kuwait" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong> Did You Know? </strong> <span style="color: #800000;"> Kuwait has the highest reserves among GCC countries, relative to its GDP at 542%. </span> <a href="https://www.databook.marmoremena.com/kuwait" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">  - <strong>Learn more </strong></span></a></blockquote>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Long term trends</strong>
Retail industry will be among the last few sectors to recover in Kuwait as a pick-up in discretionary spending is expected to take time to regain pre-COVID-19 levels. Kuwait’s retail demand is generally split between popular community centers, with focus on food and beverage concepts, as well as larger scale regional shopping centers, which have demonstrated high occupancy rates and stable leasing rates. Footfalls in these large-scale retail centres will take a hit due to a fall in tourism, increasing preference of customers to purchase online, lower income levels and the outward movement of expats. Food and other essential goods will continue to see a steady flow, and could regain normalcy sooner.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Average mall occupancy levels across existing stock before COVID-19 remained strong at 93%,indicating an opportunity for retailer as well as customer-led demand growth moving forward. Due to the pandemic’s effects, the reopening of stores has been cautious. Kuwait government released a strategy for reopening malls in 2020 that includes strict checking and social distancing norms. These norms are expected to stay until a cure is found. Considering these factors, recovery to pre-COVID-19 levels seem unlikely in 2020. However, e-commerce purchases could witness a rise during the period. Large scale retailers who have the necessary infrastructure and delivery channels to sell and deliver products online are likely to be less affected than the smaller players who do not have such facilities. Support provided to SMEs by Banks and the government will provide relief to retailers. In the long-term, further measures are expected to support recovery. Adelay in introduction of a 5% value-added tax (VAT) will be a welcome relief for retailers and consumers as it could potentially be a deterrent for consumer spending.</p>


<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Challenges </strong>
Kuwait retail sector remains challenging primarily due to COVID-19. The progress achieved so far have stunted due to the changes brought forth due to the pandemic. In addition, factors like government regulations, import delays, and limitations to the availability of commercial retail and warehousing space have also mounted significant challenges in the recent past. Zoning laws in the country are also strict, something which further squeezes the accessibility of retail space. This often impacts smaller firms the most, making it harder for them to increase market share. Moreover, Kuwait has introduced a rather stringent set of rules and policies for its expatriate population so as to address the rising concern among the local population which can have a negative impact on the retail sector. Expatriates are increasingly exposed to layoffs, thousands of expatriate contracts being cancelled over the past year. Although there was an increase in total arrivals, the growth was associated with the implementation of new infrastructure and development projects, with the recruitment of blue-collar workers in support of employment figures.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Outlook</strong>
Favourable demographics, rise in population and a strong growth trajectory in tourism, and high per capita income are expected to favour Kuwait’s retail sector in the long-term. However, the landscape will witness a material shift in the near term due to COVID-19. Retailers need to absorb the short term pain and modify their business models to reach out to online customers as well. Brick and mortar retailers still have scope as several customers in selective segments like apparel, furniture still give preference to factors like look and feel. However, they will also have to diversify their distribution channels to support e-commerce. Competition from hypermarkets is expected to increase over the years to come as consumers increase demand for foreign brands and lifestyle alternatives. As more and more consumers turn towards online shopping, retailers will need to focus more towards these platforms with increased efforts to integrate them into their customer experience models to avoid losing out on a wide customer base.</p>

		<Title>[:en]Has Coronavirus cases peaked in the World and GCC[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]The outbreak of novel Coronavirus across the globe, which affected lives of millions of people continues to take its toll on the global economies. With more than 7-8 months into the crisis the virus is still omnipresent. It forced countries to adopt control measures like lockdown, curfew, social distancing, masks etc. As a result of which many countries have been successful in curbing the rate of spread and have also moved past the peak in terms of maximum confirmed cases reported. 

<strong>How should one define peak?</strong>
Calculating the peak may become a very cumbersome task requiring statistical analysis, rather a look into the numbers alone could also help us understand the trends. The most important metric in this regard is the number of reported cases on a daily frequency. The cases reported usually follows a bell curve pattern, in which the count begins to increase to reach a peak before it begins to decline. It is also important to check if the recovery rates are improving, as a situation wherein recovery rate begins to drop could indicate that a possibility of a resurgence exists. 

<strong>7 months into the crisis how have countries fared?</strong>
Many countries appear to have past their peak. The below chart helps understand about the peak attained by respective countries. The USA being the worst affected economy attained its peak on 16th July, wherein a country like India is which is also reopening its economy and businesses is moving within a range very close to the current identified peak. Singapore on the other hand has managed the situation quite well, although after the initial success, it also had its share of issues with the case hike particularly reported in labour camps.

Most of the countries have seen a substantial improvement in the recovery rates compared to the peak period. Notable examples are Singapore which moved from 10% recovery to 96.1% recovery rate and South Korea which moved from mere 0.6% to 80.5%. Russia, South Africa, Chile have also shown good improvements. Countries which have crossed 80%+ recovery rates are better positioned to manage future spikes if any, as higher recovery rate entails less burden on the healthcare infrastructure. Better healthcare in turn is instrumental in curbing death rates, as critical patients are able to get the necessary aid on time.

<strong>Has GCC countries reached their peaks?</strong>
GCC countries were quick to react to COVID-19 threat and had imposed very strict restrictions on mobility. Certainly this has helped the region navigate through a difficult phase and begin to re-open the economy. Depending on the measures taken at varying timelines each country has reached a peak at different time points.

Among GCC Countries Oman and Qatar are currently reporting cases which are lower by more than the 80% mark, signalling the worst may be over. Saudi Arabia has also seen good improvement over the period. Bahrain, UAE and Kuwait are also reporting lower cases than the peak, but the drop is not as significant as in the case of other countries in the GCC region.. Kuwait in particular has been reporting flat numbers, with very mild variation.

<strong>Recovery trends for the GCC countries:</strong>
Except Kuwait most of the GCC Countries were above 45% of recovery rate at the time of peak. This improved substantially in the current period as all the GCC countries are having phenomenal recovery rates of above 85%. This clearly indicates that for future spikes GCC countries are well prepared to respond.

In summary GCC Countries looks to have weathered the current storm.. However, with Dubai opening up for tourists, Kuwait entering its 4th phase of reopening and similar opening up of economies might pose a challenge to manage.

<strong>Does reaching the peak mean the worst is over?</strong>
Not necessarily, Australia, Japan and South Korea have all seen the emergence of the so called ‘second wave’.

Even China has been very aggressively attempting to contain the emergence of the second wave as it resorts to extensive testing and subsequent measures in any new cluster posing a threat of re-emergence. Re-opening of economies to sustain livelihood has also brought back the risk of a second wave. Development of vaccine or herd immunity are the only two viable options to weather this challenge. There are very good progress being made on the vaccine development front but the wait is still on for a long term solution.

		<Title>[:en]Saudi Arabia Banking Sector – The worst might not be over yet[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">COVID-19 pandemic has pressurized banking asset quality and increased the demand for credit. As signs of normalcy returns, banks face the challenging task of managing the asset quality while expanding balance sheets. The strength of a country’s banking sector is often reliant on its underlying economic conditions. As is the case for Saudi Arabia, which has the second largest banking industry in the GCC by total assets, with roughly 29% of the region’s total banking assets. According to estimates from Al Rajhi Bank, Saudi Arabia’s economy is expected to contract by 6.8% in 2020, affected by low oil demand and pandemic related lockdown measures. Sectors such as energy, logistics, transport, aviation, retail and manufacturing are likely to be among the worst affected. Banks having large exposure to these stressed sectors are expected to witness deterioration in asset quality, which would increase provisioning and ultimately affecting their bottom line. We have covered Saudi Arabia’s banking sector in greater detail in our recently published report ‘<a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/saudi-arabia-banking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Saudi Arabia Banking: Caught in the COVID-19 Grip</a>', which includes the forecasts for 2020 after considering the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on domestic banks.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Bank credit in Saudi Arabia witnessed an uptick at the end of 2019, increasing by 7.6% and trended upwards in the start of 2020 due to the pickup in real estate loans related to the government’s housing program. Disbursement of credit has fallen since the lockdown measures were put in place, with credit uptake expected to stay below pre-COVID-19 levels in the near future. Deposits witnessed a robust year-on-year growth of 18.2% in 2019 due to the increase in public sector deposits, which were largely from the proceeds of Saudi Aramco’s stake sale. Deposit growth is likely to slow down in the remainder of 2020.</p>

[caption id="attachment_4789" align="alignnone" width="800"]<a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/saudi-power/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignleft wp-image-3805 size-large" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Saudi-Power-Sector_800x150.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="105" /></a> Ad: Marmore Research Report[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;">Saudi Government and the Central bank have been using fiscal and monetary tools to soften the economic impact of COVID-19. Relief has been provided to borrowers in the form of deferment of loan repayments, due to which the impact on non-performing loans were masked in the second quarter earnings result in 2020. NPL ratio of Saudi Banks have been low in the past few years and stood at 1.9% at the end of 2019. A spike in bad loans is expected once the deferment relaxations are removed, showing a much clearer picture of the banking sector in terms of asset quality. A key risk that could emerge would be the interplay of receding stimulus measures and the potential asset quality deterioration. Liquidity remains intact with the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) declining slightly in 2019. Deposits remain the primary source of funding for Saudi banks. Deposits are mostly in local currency and make up more than 90% of total funding in Saudi banks. This proportion is the highest among other GCC countries, providing a strong cushion from a liquidity perspective.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Aggregate revenue of listed Saudi banks grew by 6.5% in 2019, with interest rate cuts not having a negative impact on interest income. However, shrinking net interest margins, sluggish credit growth, increase in bad loans and higher provisioning are expected to affect profitability of banks in 2020. Accounting for slippages and the necessity for higher provisioning due to the anticipated increase in bad loans, net income for the full year 2020 is expected to fall sharply. In the first half of 2020, aggregate net income of listed Saudi banks fell by 41% on a year-on-year basis.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Business models of banks would also undergo a transformation owing to the change in customer behavior. The transition towards digitalization of banking services will gain further traction in the coming years as customers start getting accustomed to digital modes of banking during the pandemic time where direct interactions between personnel is discouraged. Banks are likely to invest heavily in technology during the downturn to gain a competitive edge over technologically advanced fintech players who are looking to gain market share at the expense of banks. Partnerships between fintech companies and banks is also likely to take place, with each of them trying to capitalize on the other’s strengths. There could be further consolidation of the banking sector through mergers and acquisitions in the near term to create stronger entities that are more resistant to economic shocks. Overall, Saudi Arabia’s banking sector faces a stern test during the rest of the year, with the worst yet to come.</p>

		<Title>[:en]Boursa Kuwait’s stock surges on its trading debut – Has privatization been a success?[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">Boursa Kuwait Securities Company has surged more than 10 times since it debuted on the Kuwait Premier Market index on September 14th when it became only the third stock exchange in the MENA region to be listed after the Dubai Financial Market and Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Share prices rose as high as 1,210 fils and closed the day at 1,055 fils after being priced at 100 fils during the IPO last year.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As part of the IPO, 50% of the company’s shares were sold to Kuwaiti nationals. This followed the 44% stake sale to a consortium of domestic and international investors in February 2019. The remaining 6% will be owned by the Public Institution for Social Security.
The successful listing will provide a boost to the privatization drive of the Kuwait Government as it looks to increase non-oil revenues. The significant gains accrued by private Kuwaiti investors in the listing will help generate more interest in subsequent privatization of other Kuwaiti state-owned enterprises. The listing of Boursa Kuwait follows the listing of the Kuwaiti utility ‘Shamal Az-Zour Al-Oula Power and Water Company’ (Aznoula) in the premier market in August which became the first private-public partnership project to be listed in Kuwait.</p>

<blockquote><a href="https://www.databook.marmoremena.com/kuwait" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong> Did You Know? </strong> 
<span style="color: #800000;">

<p style="text-align: left;">These listings are a part of a wider divestment programme by the government that will see 40 state assets privatized over the next 20-30 years. In 2016, the government had announced that 60% of public sector companies would be privatized, with the private sector allowed to acquire shares of up to USD 9billion in those companies.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, past privatization plans have often stalled in Kuwait such as the unsuccessful sale of Kuwait Airways in 2013. One of the reasons for the failure was the high cost of existing employment arrangements as Kuwaiti parliamentarians sought to protect jobs in the future privatized entities.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is likely to be an issue in subsequent privatizations as the new management would want to streamline costs including employee expenses. Boursa Kuwait stock likely benefited due to it being a more tech-oriented company without significant labor costs. Other Kuwaiti state owned enterprises with high employee costs may not see the same traction with investors. So the successful listing of Boursa Kuwait may be too soon to judge the success of the privatization drive, though this is undoubtedly a good start.</p>

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">Tourism has been one of the focus areas of GCC countries’ diversification agenda and aviation sector in the region has been an attendant beneficiary. Closure of borders and travel restrictions were one of the first measures taken by countries around the world to curtail the spread of COVID-19. These measures had brought the aviation industry to standstill.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">According to IATA, revenue of airlines in GCC region is expected to decline by 56% in 2020 and while the passenger numbers are expected to drop by 54%. The number of flights in Middle East region had reached their lowest point in April 2020, dropping by 92% relative to early January 2020. As of late July, the number of flights were 70% lower than January 2020, indicating roadblocks in recovery.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Persisting travel restrictions particularly in international travel, limited capacity flights, quarantine requirements, hesitation of passengers to travel due to COVID-19 fears would continue to weigh down the industry. The threat of second wave of COVID-19 and subsequent lockdown restrictions remain.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Airlines are resorting to various measures such as reducing workforce numbers, offering unpaid leaves to staff, focusing on cargo transportation etc. to tide over the crisis. For example, Kuwait Airways and Emirates Airlines have trimmed their workforce by 25% and 15% respectively . Etihad Airways is offering COVID-19 insurance for its passengers to boost demand. Government measures to support the industry include capital injection in Qatar Airways and Emirates Airlines by their respective governments and Saudi Arabia’s fee waiver for slot-coordinated airports.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Airlines and airports would need to adhere to strict safety procedures that would help restore consumer confidence. Tech enabled processes such as self-service check-in and contactless health screening are likely to become integral part of the check-in process. In parallel, ensuring liquidity through cash preservation and reducing fixed costs are essential for airlines to tide over these tough times.</p>

		<Title>[:en]Flurry of Bond issuances - How are GCC countries placed?[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">The year 2020 has seen bond issuances totaling USD 42billion so far by GCC governments as they try to raise funds in the market to plug record deficits due to the oil price crash and the COVID-19 crisis.
GCC Sovereign yields have come down since the market selloff in March at the height of the crisis. As on October 6, 10-year yields for Kuwait Government bonds stands at 1.48% (a fall from 2.37%, 2020-start) while that of Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and Qatar stand at 1.95%, 1.82% and 1.92% respectively.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Some GCC nations have been successful in raising debt even during the turmoil. Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia were able to successfully issue debt in April even when yields where higher than they are right now. They are well placed to issue new debt when the need arises.

However, Kuwait has not been able to issue new debt due to the public debt law not being passed by the parliament. After a debut Eurobond issuance in 2017, Kuwait’s public-debt law lapsed, rendering the government unable to issue new bonds.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Bahrain and Oman, the GCC members with below-investment grade ratings have also seen their 10-year yields decrease since March despite multiple downgrades by rating agencies. Oman’s yield on its 10-year USD denominated bond came down from 12% on March 19 to 7.06% on October 6. Bahrain’s yields decreased from 7.3% on May 11 to 5.9% on October 6.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Following Bahrain's successful USD 1billion sukuk issue and USD 1billion in 12-year bond at 5.45% yield this month, Oman is planning to come up with a USD 3/4billion issuance. Expectation of support from other GCC members have meant that Bahrain and Oman have seen lower yields compared to other countries with similar sovereign ratings and are consequently better placed to issue more debt.</p>

		<Title>[:en]Secular trends underline long-term growth for Islamic asset management[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">This article was first published in Islamic Finance news Volume 17 Issue 41 dated the 14th October 2020</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">S&P global ratings expects Islamic finance industry (USD 2.4trillion) to witness subdued growth in low single digits for 2020/21 after registering strong growth of 11.4% the previous year, on the back of robust issuance and strong performance of Sukuk. We expect Islamic funds, which accounts for 4% of the overall Islamic finance industry, to fare better than industry as the demand for shariah compliant assets are on rise following their outperformance over conventional peers and favorable tailwinds such as development of new products, and increased regulatory support.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Islamic Asset Management Landscape: An Overview</strong>
Islamic asset management industry as evidenced by Islamic funds currently stands at approx. USD 100billion that is spread over 1,700+ funds including equity mutual funds, money market/trade finance, sukuk, and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). However, the Assets under Management (AuM) remain concentrated within the markets of Iran, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia accounting for more than three-fourths of the total AuM.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The stock markets have performed poorly and the economic outlook for core Islamic markets such as Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and Southeast Asian countries remains worrisome. However, expanding investor base, outperformance over conventional funds, increasing investor preference for Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) funds and Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) funds, introduction of new products and regulatory support could support the development of Islamic asset management industry.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Shariah funds outperform conventional peers during COVID-19</strong>
Performance of most funds, shariah and conventional, took a hit in March 2020 as markets worldwide plunged. Global economic activity came to a sudden halt following imposition of strict lockdowns and closing of international borders, to prevent movement of people in a bid to contain the spread of COVID-19, throughout the world. However, shariah funds were able to outperform their conventional peers, as they lack exposure to conventional banking, and entertainment industry (alcohol, gambling, tobacco, and cinema) – businesses that took a big hit due to the lockdowns. Consequently, overweighting sectors such as technology and defensive sectors including telecom and healthcare have led shariah funds to outperform conventional funds. For instance, Islamic Global Equity Fund has returned 20.6% for the year, as of September-end while its conventional counterpart Global Equity fund has managed to return only 5.4% for the year (Data shown for HSBC Fund).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Improved and better performance of shariah funds could perpetuate fresh inflows in the short-run and entice new set of investors, not limited to those seeking shariah-compliant solutions. The trend could be evident among retail investors who typically act by buying into the best performing funds. This presents an opportunity for retail Islamic asset managers to attain scale that is most sought after in the fund management business.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Incentivizing retail participation in Sukuk</strong>
Recent sovereign sukuk issuances from the GCC countries witnessed enthused response from international investors, including pension funds and insurance funds. However, retail participation have remained minimal due to various challenges including complex sukuk structures, larger issue size and difficulty in acquiring them in primary/secondary market. Minimizing issue size, enhancing disclosures to improve transparency and increasing the range of sukuk that could be offered for retail investors could incentivize their participation. Having wide-ranging options in fixed income helps in portfolio diversification and shall boost returns to meet investor objectives.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Islamic ETFs: An Emerging Opportunity</strong>
ETFs being passive in nature act as low cost, easy-to-access investment option. In conventional landscape, they have grown to be the leading choice of investment vehicle for retail investors. However, ETFs remain a small proportion – amounting to less than 10% of overall AuM in the Islamic fund landscape offering immense potential for growth. The largest single country Islamic ETF was launched in 2018, Al Rayan Qatar ETF with assets of USD 120million – to capitalize on foreigners interest post the upgradation of Qatar market into MSCI Emerging Market Index. Similar such initiatives could be a source of opportunity for Islamic asset managers to widen their product offering globally.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Considering a flurry of sukuk issuance, both from sovereign and corporates especially in the GCC region, establishing ETF vehicles for sukuk could make it easier for retail participation. In August 2019, Al-Bilad Investment Company established an open-ended ETF that seeks to track the performance of Saudi Sovereign Sukuk Index.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Riding the ESG wave for better positioning and reach</strong>
Islamic investments apply negative filters on business activities that are haram (prohibited) by shariah principles. These include ‘sin’ businesses such as conventional lending (banking and financial institutions), entertainment industries (gambling, alcohol, tobacco, music, and cinema), arms and defense companies. They also apply financial screens and prohibit investments in firms that have high debt and those that receive interest income.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Investors are increasingly paying attention to incorporate ESG component in their portfolios. Shariah compliant investments naturally overlap with ESG and SRI requirements. This could allow Islamic asset managers to tap a wider investor base outside of traditional target markets.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To conclude, Islamic retail asset management offers immense opportunities in terms of product development, expansion into new markets, and widened investor base. We believe that the favorable tail winds and regulatory support, along with stronger thrust on social nature of the Islamic industry could extend the growth story for years to come.</p>

		<Title><![CDATA[[:en]Steep cut in project spending could depress Kuwait's oil output[:]]]></Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">Oil majors around the world are scaling back their investment plans on the back of drastic fall in oil prices driven by lockdowns to curb COVID-19 and the current stagnation in prices. Kuwait had also announced plans to slash capital spending in its oil sector by around KD 700million from KD 3.7billion (USD 12.2billion) to KD 3billion (USD 9.9billion) during the 2020-2021 fiscal year due to a sharp rise in the country's budget deficits. State operator, Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) plans to decrease its five-year capital spending by 25% to KD 19.8billion (USD 65billion).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The means to cut spending included cancellation or postponement of projects and plans to merge KPC’s subsidiaries. The projects cancelled so far include a USD 1.5billion utility-scale solar power plant and a USD 400million oil project at the northern Ratqa field.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the context of approval of KPC’s financing plan by Council of Ministers, Kuwait’s Public Debt Management Committee had suggested three different scenarios to rationalise capital spending.</p>

<ul class="rdetails_list" style="text-align: left;">
 	<li>KD 20billion, over a span of 16 years</li>
 	<li>KD 18billion, over 15 years</li>
 	<li>KD 14billion, over 20 years</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">This would trim KPC’s capital spending to nearly KD 4billion (USD 13.2billion) during the five year spending period. This compares with KPC’s base estimate of capital spending at KD 27.7billion for a five-year spending period with bonds comprising of 50% of the total financing plan.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The reduction in spending as proposed by the Debt Management Committee could reportedly result in current crude oil production of 2.8 million bpd, which is estimated to be worth KD 11billion, dropping to 1.8 million bpd at the end of the five-year plan. Consequently, it could lead to loss of expected returns from projects due to cancellation of contracts and in turn result in decline in state’s oil revenues by KD 20.4billion during the period of the five-year plan. While cost-cutting measures are widely resorted to by oil majors for tiding over the current times, a steep cut in capital spending might affect future production and revenue.</p>

		<Title>[:en]IMF forecasts steeper fall in GCC countries’ 2020 GDP[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">As the world charts its recovery from COVID-19’s impact amidst the resurgence of cases in some countries and lingering threat of spike in others, the countries’ recovery path and economic outlook are being closely watched.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">IMF in its recent World Economic Outlook (October 2020) has revised GDP forecasts for GCC countries downwards from its April forecast, citing deeper-than-expected impact of lockdowns on mobility and weak global growth.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For GCC as a whole, IMF expects GDP to contract by 6% in 2020. Non-oil GDP is expected to contract by 5.7% mainly due to collapse of service sector caused by a decline in domestic and external demand. Oil GDP is expected to contract by 6.2% on the back of production cuts based on OPEC+ agreements caused by sluggish oil demand.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The revision has been steepest for Oman and Kuwait. Kuwait’s lockdown measures to curb the spread of the pandemic has been one of the longest continuous stretches in the world, impacting spending and investment activity (World Bank).</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">GCC region is expected to grow by 2.3% in 2021 with all countries other than Oman expected to return to growth in 2021. However, the estimate hinges on the path of the pandemic. Oil prices in 2021 are expected to be stagnant in the range of USD 40-50 per barrel. Fiscal break even oil price for all GCC countries except Qatar is estimated to be higher than this range. Oil exports from GCC for 2021 is also expected to be below 2019 levels. Except UAE, all GCC countries are also expected to post negative fiscal balance in 2020 and 2021. The countries have been resorting to measures such as spending cuts, borrowing (except Kuwait), and hike in VAT (Saudi Arabia) etc. to counter the fall in oil revenue. Economic diversification by boosting non-oil sector, continued coronavirus safety measures, targeted implementation of pandemic related policies with streamlined procedures would play a key role in strengthening the recovery of GCC economies.</p>

		<Title>[:en]MSCI includes Kuwait stocks in their Emerging Markets indices[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI), the world’s largest index provider, reclassified Kuwait to <strong>‘Emerging Markets’</strong> status from <strong>‘Frontier Markets’</strong>. 

The inclusion to the Emerging Market Index took place on Nov. 30, 2020 after market close, while the deletion of Kuwaiti securities from the Frontier Markets 100 index will be phased over five successive index reviews. The implementation was originally slated to take place in May 2020 but was delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Seven Kuwaiti Stocks have been added to the MSCI Emerging Markets Index at an aggregate weight of 0.58%. The list of stocks are listed below:

<strong>Exhibit 1: Kuwait Stocks to be included in MSCI Emerging Markets Index</strong>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kuwait-Stocks-to-be-included-in-MSCI-Emerging-Markets-Index-Marmore-Article.jpg" alt="Kuwait Stocks to be included in MSCI Emerging Markets Index" width="800" height="762" />
<span style="color: #696969; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;">Source: Refinitiv; Data as of November 29, 2020</span>

According to Reuters, the move is expected to bring in at least USD 2billion in passive investment flows into Kuwait equity markets. Assets worth approximately USD 1.8 trillion track the MSCI Emerging Markets (EM) index and such passive investors would be mandated to invest in Kuwaiti stocks based on their weightage. 

MSCI had granted conditional approval for the inclusion of Kuwait in the EM index as part of MSCI’s 2019 Annual Market Classification Review held on June 25, 2019, paving the way for increased participation from foreign investors in Kuwait’s capital market and driving significant capital inflows to the country. 

As a part of the inclusion, Kuwaiti had instituted reforms like removal of foreign ownership restrictions for listed banks, change in the settlement cycle to T+3 for foreign and local investors. etc. As the Kuwaiti capital markets move more towards international standards, the outlook of foreign investors towards the country could also become positive. Greater inflows into the markets and the economy would encourage other domestic companies to list their companies on the stock exchange.

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">This article was first published in <a href="https://www.islamicfinancenews.com/islamic-retail-asset-management-2.html?access-key=5ef698cd9fe650923ea331c15af3b160" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Islamic Finance News dated the 22nd December 2020</a></p>

<blockquote>We live in times where consumers are increasingly aware of their choices and demand that values and purpose are embedded into products that they consume. In financial context, today’s generation seem less driven by the narrow definition of investing to generate returns and consider social and environmental impact of the companies they invest in to be an important part of investment decision-making.</blockquote>

Millennials view their investments as a way to express their social and environment values (US Trust survey on wealthy millennials). The structural shift that the investment industry is undergoing has profound implications for the Islamic asset management. Consequently, purpose driven investment solutions that promote responsible behaviour - an inherent part of Islamic finance, could soon find itself in the mainstream.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Sharia-compliant investments abide by Islamic tenets against usury and uncertainty. It forbids irresponsible profiteering at the expense of others, shuns businesses that harms environment and damages our society. For instance, interest or excessive interest that leads to slavery is prohibited in Islamic finance. It also prohibits investments where the payout is uncertain such as gambling or speculation. Investment in businesses such as those that deal with weapons/arms manufacturing, alcohol and brewing, tobacco, or pork-related products are avoided. Islamic principles thus strives to create a sustainable and socially responsible financial system that largely appeals to the millennial investing attitude.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">As younger demographic cohorts, push values-based investing to the forefront ‘Islamic funds’ along with ‘Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing’ have emerged as the fastest growing segments within the financial industry.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">However, not all is rosy and the industry is faced with multiple challenges. Islamic assets remain concentrated, with the markets of Iran, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia accounting for more than three-fourths of the total assets. There is a prevailing notion among investors that screening for businesses that adhere to Islamic principles would lead to additional layer of costs in terms of research and certification.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>2020 - A review</strong>
<strong>Sharia-compliant funds outperform conventional peers</strong>
Global funds, as measured by their benchmark indices performance, recouped most of their losses and entered positive territory in Q3, 2020. However, across region sharia-compliant benchmarks have outperformed their conventional peers. For instance, performance of Dow Jones Islamic Market (DJIM) World Index stood at 14.3% (YTD, as of Q3 2020) while its conventional peer gained 0.9% for the same period.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Table: Market performance up to Q3, 2020</strong>
<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6367" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Market-performance-up-to-Q3-2020-Marmore-Research.jpg" alt="Market performance up to Q3, 2020" width="840" height="322" />
<span style="color: #696969; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;">Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices; Index performance based on total returns in USD</span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The outperformance of sharia-compliant funds could be explained by differing sector allocations. Islamic funds lack exposure to conventional banking, and entertainment industry (alcohol, gambling, tobacco, and cinema) – businesses that took a big hit due to the lockdowns. Information Technology sector, driven by FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) stocks that contributed to most of the positive performance has an overweight allocation in Sharia indices compared with the conventional peers. While financials that performed poorly among various sectors remains underweight in sharia index.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">On the product side, we witnessed the launch of first actively managed sharia-compliant Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) – the Almalia Sanlam Active Sharia Global Equity ETF in September 2020. The ETF currently listed in London market has Royal Bank of Canada as the lead market maker. Introduction of actively managed sharia-compliant ETF would provide more choice to investors.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>2021 Preview </strong>
Despite the strong performance, scalability of business has remained a sore point for Islamic asset management. In the upcoming year, the robust outperformance of sharia funds could perpetuate fresh inflows and entice new set of investors - not limited to those seeking sharia-compliant. The trend could be evident among retail investors who typically act by buying into the best performing funds. The opportunity could be capitalized by retail Islamic asset managers, aided by appropriate marketing efforts to attain economies of scale that is most sought after in the fund management business.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Presently, ETFs remain a small proportion – amounting to less than 10% of overall AuM in the Islamic fund landscape. Considering a flurry of sukuk issuance, both from sovereign and corporates especially in the GCC region, establishing ETF vehicles for sukuk could make it easier for retail participation. ETF segment offers immense potential for growth and we could see further products.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Conclusion</strong>
To conclude, potential opportunities are plenty for Islamic retail asset management in terms of product development and widening investor base. Favorable tail winds in the form of strong outperformance and enhanced focus on socially responsible investing has thrusted Islamic asset management into limelight. The industry should thwart the existing challenges and position itself favorably and scale up.</p>[:]]]></Content>

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Global stocks staged a quick recovery from the March lows</strong>
The year began with global stock markets reaching new highs in February. However, global markets saw massive falls in March as the COVID-19 outbreak became a global pandemic. At its lowest point in March, the S&P 500 saw a drawdown of 34% from the record highs seen just a month earlier in February. However, the index recovered the losses and reached new highs by October in a mere time span of seven months.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">In contrast, during the 2007-2009 recession, the S&P 500 fell from then record high of 1,565 in October 2007 to 677 in February 2009 (drawdown of 57%). The markets took a long time to find a bottom level and the following recovery was also slow. It took nearly five and half years for S&P 500 to regain the lost ground.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Unprecedented Monetary Easing by Central Banks & Fiscal Stimulus by governments</strong>
However this time, swift action by central banks and governments around the world and medical breakthroughs helped in the dramatic turnaround. The U.S. Federal Reserve, Bank of England, Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank have collectively spent USD 5.6trillion this year on quantitative easing, according to Bloomberg Economics. Central Banks have used tools like interest rate cuts and massive purchases of public and private debt to pump money into the financial system. These actions have stabilized financial markets and supported economic growth.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The U.S Federal Reserve announced an emergency rate cut of 50 bps on March 3 and another 100bps rate cut on March 15 reducing rates close to zero. The Bank of England announced an unscheduled rate cut of 65 bps on March 11.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Besides monetary measures, global governments also implemented massive fiscal measures. The U.S Government passed two COVID-19 bills totaling USD 2.9trillion in expenditure. The EU announced USD 640billion in direct spending to combat the pandemic’s effects. While, Japan has spent USD 1.06trillion in fiscal stimulus.</p>

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">GCC stocks staged a strong recovery towards the end of the year after seeing a sharp fall in March and April due to oil prices crashing and fears of sharp economic slowdown due to Covid-19. The benchmark S&P GCC Composite index recovered from the lows and ended the year with a fall of just 1.7%.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">GCC markets rose in November after pharmaceutical firms Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca announced favorable news on COVID-19 vaccine development. Subsequently, several governments including many GCC countries approved the vaccines. These developments raised investor hopes of a quick recovery in global economic growth in 2021 and helped stock markets recover their losses.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The gains continued in December despite news of a new strain of the coronavirus being detected in the U.K. Saudi Tadawul index and Qatar regained all prior losses during the year and ended 2020 up 3.6% and 0.1%, respectively for the year. Kuwait, Abu Dhabi, Bahrain, Dubai and Oman stocks ended the year with losses of 11.7%, 0.6%, 7.5%, 9.9% and 8.1% respectively.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Among Saudi Blue chips, Al-Rajhi Bank was the biggest gainer in 2020 making gains of 13.3%. Other GCC Blue chips with big yearly gains include UAE’s Abu Dhabi National Energy Company (TAQA), which rose 170% this year, Qatar’s Ezdan Holding that rose 191%. Among Kuwait premier stocks, Human Soft Holding Company was the top gainer with a yearly gain of 24%.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Defensive Stocks, Healthcare emerged as big winners in 2020</strong>
Defensive stocks in the GCC significantly outperformed the benchmark S&P GCC Composite index by nearly 50% this year. Defensive stocks are those, which perform well during periods of crisis. Their businesses tend to provide products or services that are in demand even during downturns. Examples of such sectors are consumer staples, consumer discretionary and utilities.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Exhibit 2: Performance of GCC Sectors in 2020</strong>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Performance-of-GCC-Sectors-in-2020-Marmore-Infograph-Jan-2021.jpg" alt="Performance of GCC Sectors in 2020" width="800" height="762" />
<span style="color: #696969; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;">Source: Refinitiv; Data as of December 31, 2020</span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The GCC Non-Cyclicals index that consists mainly of consumer-oriented stocks, has gained 50% in 2020. The resilient business model and expectations of robust future growth due to increased spending underpinned by growing population are further reasons for the sector’s outperformance.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Another index to significantly outperform the benchmark is the GCC Healthcare index that is up 37% in 2020. The pandemic has seen an increased investor focus on the healthcare sector in the near term. GCC Healthcare stocks have benefited from the global rally in pharmaceutical stocks as governments around the world are expected to spend billions on acquiring vaccines in the next few years. This along with increasing hospitalizations due to COVID-19 has seen healthcare and pharma stocks outperform the S&P GCC composite index. The long-term prospects for the sector also look good, as the GCC governments are likely to increase healthcare spending even after the pandemic ends.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Improving Geopolitical situation in the MENA region likely to help in the economic recovery</strong>
One of the year’s important developments in the political front with economic implications were the Abraham accords which refers to the normalization agreements between Israel and UAE first and then between Israel and Bahrain, both of which was brokered by the U.S. The agreements marked the first normalization of relations between an Arab country and Israel since that of Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The agreement is expected to strengthen economic ties between the respective nations. Abu Dhabi Investment Office (ADIO) has said that it plans to open a network of foreign offices, beginning with its first one in Tel Aviv, Israel. The areas of possible collaboration between the two countries include advanced technology and R&D across sectors such as agri-tech, biomedicine and advanced manufacturing.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Another important development was the beginning of talks between Qatar and Saudi Arabia towards ending the diplomatic conflict between Qatar and Saudi Arabia, UAE and Bahrain. The talks are being mediated by Kuwait with a major role played by the Foreign Minister Sheikh Ahmed Nasser Al Mohammad Al Sabah. Consequently, Qatar and Dubai stocks rallied in December with Qatar’s QE index rising 1.7% and Dubai’s DFM general index rising 3%.</p>

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]Oil markets were hit hard by Covid-19 pandemic and suffered losses of 21.5% in 2020. US Oil prices even went negative for a brief period in April. However, the markets initially staged a ‘relief rally’ from the lows in April/May as Oil producing countries together announced cuts in productions. Oil prices then began a period of ‘cyclical consolidation’ with prices around the USD 40/barrel mark until November. Then began the stage of ‘structural repricing’ aided by various factors. Vaccine announcements, oil market deficits, continued stimulus and weakness in USD have aided the rally in oil prices to around USD 50/barrel by the end of 2020.

As countries continue to open up their economies and administer COVID-19 vaccines, oil prices are expected to rise again and reach period of ‘structural repricing’ in which prices reach levels of USD 60/barrel and beyond by the end of 2021.

<strong>Oil Demand/Supply Projections for 2021</strong>
Global consumption of petroleum and liquid fuels will average 92.4 million b/d for all of 2020, which is down by 8.8 million b/d from 2019, before increasing by 5.8 million b/d in 2021. The EIA expects oil demand to fall by 8.8 million barrels per day this year from 2019 levels.
Global oil demand will recover more slowly than expected next year mainly because of lower expectations of jet fuel & transportation demand next year. OPEC+ group initially planned to raise production by 2.0 million barrels per day (b/d) in January 2021 but will instead raise production by 0.5 million b/d.

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<strong>Technology stocks benefit from the pandemic and significantly outperform the benchmark index</strong>
The top tech companies in the world were among the big winners with the pandemic accelerating the adoption of technology.  Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google, Facebook and Microsoft stocks saw huge gains this year as demand for e-commerce, online advertising and cloud computing during the pandemic led to soaring revenues. 

Social distancing guidelines resulted in many employees working from home. The biggest winner due to this shift was Zoom Video Communications, the video conferencing company that saw its stock price increase by more than 5 times in 2020.  
  
Tesla Inc. was the biggest gainer percentage wise, as its share price soared nearly 8 times this year. Investors are betting on its autonomous and driverless technology and its early mover advantage in electric vehicles. Tech IPOs also did spectacularly with 65 companies going public including Airbnb, Doordash and the cloud company Snowflake.

<strong>Cryptocurrencies have emerged as a mainstream investment option in 2020</strong>
Cryptocurrencies staged a stunning comeback in 2020. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies appeared back in investors’ radar, as massive monetary easing by central banks to revive economic growth stoked inflation fears and led to loss of confidence in fiat currencies. 
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are now seen as a hedge against inflation even by mainstream institutional investors. Pension funds and insurers like Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance have taken positions in cryptocurrencies. 

Payment giants like Paypal, Visa and Square allowed users to buy and sell crypto-currencies. Bitcoin ended the year at an all-time closing high of USD 28,992 on Dec 31, a rise of 304%.

		<Title>[:en]Central Bank of Kuwait Allows Banks to Distribute 2020 Dividends[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK) has been at the forefront and took various measures to limit the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Kuwait economy and the banking sector. Some of the key measures taken by the central bank include reduction in discount rate to a historically low level of 1.50% from 2.75% and maximization of lending capacity of banks to provide financing by allowing use of capital conservation buffers (2.5% of capital) for capital adequacy ratio.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In 2020, some countries had imposed restrictions on dividend distributions by banks, citing the need capital preservation by banks. CBK had stated that while global accounting rules require dividend payouts to be stopped as regulators ease capital requirements to boost liquidity, the banks could distribute dividends if they did not benefit from the eased capital adequacy requirements. The central bank had added that it would be a breach international banking rules if bank pay out dividends even as they benefit from the lower requirements.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Recent financial data of banking institutions following the publication of quarterly results has revealed that the banks did not utilize their capital conservations buffers in 2020. This has enabled CBK to announce that Kuwaiti banks may distribute cash dividends for 2020, based on their 2020 financial performance and operations. However, the decision on dividend payouts have differed among banks.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">CBK’s decision to allow banks to distribute dividends indicates that banks are resilient and have adequate capital and necessary liquidity to recover from the COVID-19 impact. This has been viewed positively by the markets, and due to the high weightage of banking stocks in Kuwait’s All Share Index, the banking index and the Kuwait All Share Index reacted favourably. For the month ending January, the banking index gained 3.4%. Kuwait Finance House and NBK increased by 6.6% and 3.9% for the month.</p>

		<Title>[:en]Revenue squeeze could spur Gulf bond issuance to new highs in 2021[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]International debt sales by sovereigns and corporates in the Gulf region topped a record USD 100billion issuance in 2020 as governments raised capital to cover their widening deficits and corporates latched upon the opportunity to strengthen their balance sheets amid low interest rates. Central banks opened up the liquidity taps to support the economy and investor frenzy for positive yielding instruments drove international debt issuance from the gulf region to record highs. 

<strong>Exhibit: GCC borrowings topped USD 100billion in 2020 – A record high</strong>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GCC-borrowings-topped-USD-100billion-in-2020-–-A-record-high-Marmore-Artilce.jpg" alt="GCC borrowings topped USD 100billion in 2020 – A record high" width="800" height="762" />
<span style="color: #696969; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;">Source: Bloomberg; Note: Includes both Sovereign and Corporate issuances.</span></p>

The economic repercussions of the impact of novel Coronavirus and the subsequent breakdown of OPEC+ supply cut agreement is unprecedented for the gulf economies. The sudden freeze in economic activity globally due to various measures such as travel restrictions (curbs on flights, public transportations and taxis), closing of schools, universities, shopping malls, commercials establishments, and curfew imposition to prevent the spread of virus created a demand shock. Transportation sector that accounts for approx. 50 percent of global oil demand by end-use category remains affected by such measures that was implemented in various degrees across countries. Subsequently, oil markets faced with excess supply, and reduced demand tumbled to low price levels. Expectations for oil price recovery in 2021 remains modest and revenue shortfalls could persist. S&P ratings firm expects the situation to normalize only by 2023.

<strong>Exhibit: Deficits to persist for GCC countries in 2021</strong>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Deficits-to-persist-for-GCC-countries-in-2021-Marmore-Article.jpg" alt="Deficits to persist for GCC countries in 2021" width="800" height="762" />
<span style="color: #696969; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;">Source: IMF, October 2020</span></p>

To balance the wide deficits and ensure continued spending amid fall in revenues, the governments could either dip into their accumulated fiscal reserves or issue additional debt. As the interest rates are at record lows and with many GCC countries having low debt compared to their emerging market peers, GCC sovereigns along with the regional corporates have tapped international debt markets for capital. As a result, the cumulative borrowings topped USD 100billion in 2020 – a record high for the GCC region.

<strong>Issuance to continue in 2021 as low oil prices squeezes government budget</strong>
In the first 26days of 2021, governments and companies worldwide raised USD 112.6billion of international bonds. The value raised is shy of all-time monthly record of USD 112.8billion set in January 2003 (Bond Radar data, Retrieved from FT). Two key factors have been in play for the ongoing bond rush. First, the coronavirus pandemic has dented the public finances and increased the borrowing needs for governments worldwide. Second, the rise in U.S. 10-year benchmark treasury yields above 1% has prompted issuers to lock-in rates at record bottom levels that may not last for long.

For 2021, GCC governments have revised their budgets and expenditures in various degrees. Saudi Arabia has stated that it would spend an estimated SAR 990billion (USD 264bn) in 2021, 7% less than that of 2020. Similarly, Kuwait in its recent budget for FY 2022 (April 01, 2021- March 31, 2022) expects its deficit to be at KD 14billion (USD 46bn), which is 52% higher than the forecast made in the original budget for the fiscal year 2021. Oil production is expected to be lower at 2.4million barrels per day (mbpd) for Kuwait in FY 2022 as against 2.5mbpd in FY 2021 due to compliance with OPEC+ agreements. 

In January 2021, Saudi Arabian government raised USD 5.5billion in dual-tranche bond sale with tenors of 12 and 40 years. Overall, it aims to increase its debt by SAR 83billion (USD 22billion) in 2021. Dubai tapped the international debt market after six years in September 2020. We could expect further issuance from the Emirate to shore up its finances.

In the case of Kuwait, parliamentary authorisation to issue or refinance debt expired in 2017. With reserves in General Reserve Fund (GRF) fast depleting, Kuwait is expected to secure approval for borrowing. Consequently, Kuwait could hit the international debt markets in 2021. For Bahrain and Oman, debt is crucial for their survival amid dwindling reserves and they would continue with issuance in 2021.  Bahrain raised USD 2billion in the third week of January 2021 amid uncertainty over help from its neighbours who have their own financial woes to deal with.

Corporates in the GCC region are not far behind. Financials and Government Related Entities (GREs) continue to be active and are shoring up capital to strengthen their balance sheets. National Commercial Bank (NCB) that is set to merge with Samba Financial Group sold USD 1.25billion tier-I sukuk at the lowest-yield, aided by strong investor demand, in the Gulf region. Aramco that raised USD 8billion in November 2020 in part to honour the dividend payments (USD 75billion per annum) could continue to do so in 2021, as well. Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) recently received a credit rating and could come up with debt issue this year.

		<Title>[:en]Kuwaiti banks – Earnings report 2020[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">All major Kuwaiti banks reported their financial results for the fourth quarter of 2020 and that of the whole year. As expected, all the banks reported a reduction in net profits for 2020 compared to that of 2019 mainly due to the increase in provisions and impairment charges for bad loans caused by COVID-19’s disruption to the economy.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Kuwaiti Banks continue to clean up their balance sheets</strong>
With the exception of Commercial Bank of Kuwait, all banks saw an increase in provisions for 2020 compared to 2019. Loan loss provisions charged on the banks’ income statements reached about KD 852 million in 2020. The NPL ratio, which is the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans increased from 1.5% in 2019 to 2% in 2020, according to the Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK). As result, the Provision Coverage Ratio (PCR) that is the ratio of provisions to non-performing loans stood at 222% for 2020, falling from 271% in 2019 as NPLs rose faster than provisions. PCR despite coming down is still at a high level because Kuwaiti banks have been proactively providing provisions in the past few years.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Dividends slashed for 2020</strong>
The CBK had allowed banks to distribute cash dividends for FY2020, as they had not utilized their capital conservation buffers. However, only 4 Kuwaiti banks announced cash dividends for 2020 and all of them announced lower dividends compared to 2019. Most banks have maintained their bonus shares distribution.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Despite CBK giving the go ahead to pay dividends, many banks did not do so, in order to strengthen the balance sheet and improve liquidity. The decline in aggregate net profits by 53% in 2020 and the increase in provisions have also been a factor in lower dividend payments. However, the rebound in oil prices and the eventual normalising of the economy due to vaccinations may see a reduction in bad loans in 2021. This and the relatively strong balance sheets of Kuwaiti banks may see a return to normal dividend payments by banks in 2021, if earnings recovery materialises.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Downside risks for banks could be a downgrade of Kuwait’s sovereign ratings because of the failure to pass the debt law. Kuwait banks are closely linked to the government finances and are likely to see a downgrade if the sovereign rating is downgraded as it happened when Fitch ratings changed Kuwait’s outlook to ‘Negative’ last month. An increase in NPLs due to slower recovery in oil prices and a further rise in COVID-19 cases are other risks facing banks.</p>

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">GCC banks continue to tap the bond markets at a brisk pace in 2021 as they try to take advantage of low interest rates amid prospects of economic recovery. The impact of COVID-19 on earnings have spurred banks to raise capital through bonds to strengthen their balance sheets. Banks also needed to issue new bonds to pay off the ones maturing this year.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">UAE’s Emirates NBD bank had the first public debt issuance in GCC this year with a USD 750 million senior bond with five-year tenor. First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) has raised a combined USD 1.56 billion issuing bonds denominated in U.S. Dollars, Chinese Renminbi, Swiss Francs and Pound Sterling. It is planning to issue a euro denominated bond.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>GCC banks have been issuing new AT1 bonds </strong>
There have also been some AT1 (Additional Tier-1) bond issuance from GCC banks. Considered the riskiest debt that banks can offer, these are perpetual bonds that could be called (principal is repaid to bondholders) after a specified period by the issuing bank. Banks have been issuing AT1 bonds since the global financial crisis to raise capital and comply with Basel III Capital requirements. Even though banks have the option of continuing interest payments indefinitely, they generally exercise the call option at the first available ‘callable date’ to show their financial strength. For example, First Abu Dhabi Bank repaid USD 750 million to investors of its AT1 bonds that were callable in June 2020.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In January, Saudi Arabia's National Commercial Bank (NCB) had issued AT1 sukuk for USD 1.2bn at 3.5%, the lowest launch yield for issuances in GCC. The yield is also reportedly lower than the recent issuances by some higher rated global firms such as HSBC, UBS and Standard Chartered. This issuance comes even as the merger with Samba Financial group is in progress.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">In February 2021, National Bank of Kuwait (NBK) issued USD 700 million of new AT1 bonds at 3.625%, the second lowest yield in the GCC this year after NCB. This was to repay an older AT1 issuance which will be callable by April 21, 2021. Qatari banks too, have issued new AT1 bonds to repay maturing ones. Ahli Bank raised USD 300 million in AT1 bonds at 4% and Commercial Bank USD 500 million at 4.5%. Qatar National Bank, the country’s largest lender sold USD 1 billion in 5-year conventional bonds, at 95 bps over mid-swaps for general corporate purposes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Conclusion</strong>
While, the hunt for yield and abundant liquidity are likely to continue to drive investor interest in GCC bonds, the low interest rate environment would help issuers finance their businesses at sustainable levels and strengthen their operations and also to repay maturing debt.</p>

		<Title>[:en]Indian startups Eye a new “SPAC” opportunity[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">When US stock market sneezes, Emerging markets including India catches cold! However, this time around there is positive news for Indian tech startups in the form of Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPAC’s). Though SPAC’s are not a new concept, suddenly they seem to be in a rage in US for a variety of reasons. Before that, let us briefly look at what this is.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As the name implies, it is a special purpose vehicle formed and floated in the market with no underlying business to start with. Sponsors (the idea initiators basically) form and list this SPAC by raising funds from investors with the objective of finding a target company which typically happens to be a private company mostly in the tech space. Since the underlying SPAC does not start with any business operations, it is also naughtily referred to as “blank-cheque” companies. So long as the target is yet to be identified, it continues to be a blank cheque company. Since it has no underlying operations or valuations, it is priced at $10 and may trade with a small premium or discount around this value till the sponsors disclose the target details. However, if market participants sniff rumors about the target companies, then the share price may start appreciating rapidly during which time it attracts retail investors. If the subsequent disclosure about the target proves to be true, then everyone including the retail investors walk to the bank laughing. Else, better luck next time!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While this is a US phenomenon, it has also started attracting Indian investors. I tried explaining the workings of a SPAC through a live illustration.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SPAC-An-Indian-Illustration.jpg" alt="SPAC – An Indian Illustration" width="800" height="762" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">India has the third largest startup ecosystem in the world with over 40,000 startups and 38 unicorns (companies valued at a billion dollar or more). While the number of unicorns are not that high when benchmarked globally, the arrival of SPAC promises some good news for many tech startups to aspire the unicorn status.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The reason why SPAC’s have become overnight sensation is due to the onerous regulations surrounding the typical IPO process. Companies aspiring to go through the traditional IPO route has to fulfill profitability, financial and business disclosure requirements that can be considered stringent. This results in invasive due diligence along with high cost of listing. Due to this, the average time a startup stays private has increased from 4 years to 11 years, which can be a huge negative for initial investors (mostly venture capitalists and private equity firms) who desire for early profitable exits.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The untypical SPAC provides an easy and quick solution to all the travails of typical IPO and hence this new found enthusiasm for SPAC’s. The SPAC structure is highly investor friendly where investors can opt to receive their money back at the time when the deal is announced. This unique structure ensures faster IPO option for private companies with low-risk investments for investors with equity upside. In addition, the SPAC structure provides for better price discovery as compared to IPO route where price is usually determined through book-building process where investors can know the price only towards the end of the IPO calendar. No wonder, the US market has witnessed a deluge of SPAC’s, with more than 240 SPAC’s raising nearly $72 billion dollars yielding an average SPAC fund raising of approximately $320 million. It is estimated that around four SPAC’s are being formed on a daily basis. When sponsors float a SPAC and raise funds, it provides them with the dry powder necessary to identify and consummate targets.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Facing Flak</strong>
However, there are valid criticisms surrounding this sudden hype. Firstly, the 2-year deadline to identify and reverse merge a target can be a serious pain point for sponsors. As the clock ticks away, the bargaining power of sponsors dwindles leading to sub-par valuation outcomes. Secondly, in this race to find a decent target within two years, sponsors may land up with bad deals leading to negative outcomes for everyone including the sponsors leading to significant dilution. Thirdly, the mushrooming of SPAC’s can increase competition for good companies to take public. Fourthly, since SPAC’s are dominated by retail investors, their behavior for approving the demerger process through voting can prove onerous. In a typical IPO scenario, existing investors tend to be promoters and institutional investors who are easy to deal with when it comes to voting approvals. However, coordinating the same with thousands of retail investors is certainly not a walk in the park. It is said that many retail investors that buy SPAC’s from the open market are not even aware of the voting requirements.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Yet It’s advantage “SPAC”!</strong>
For now, the pros outweigh the cons for Indian tech startups who can aspire for faster outcomes through SPAC’s. From a regulatory point of view, the structure of Indian SPAC’s can attract a variety of legislations including but not limited to corporate law, FDI regulations, FEMA and Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS). Hence, this may involve extensive legal consultations.

In summary, SPAC’s provide a nice additional route to monetize valuation for Indian tech startups and hence it will be interesting to watch this space.</p>[:]]]></Content>

		<Title>[:en]FAQ’s: Break-even Oil price[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>1. What is Break even oil price? What does an increasing or decreasing BEOP mean?</strong>
Fiscal breakeven oil price (BEP) can be defined simply as the “oil price that balances an oil‐exporting country’s budget. Ever since the fall of Brent crude prices in mid – 2014, the GCC countries have envisioned various plans to reduce their dependence on oil revenues. The COVID-19 pandemic sent oil prices tumbling owing to a global lockdown and travel restrictions in place since March 2020. The pandemic has exposed GCC nations’ financial weakness and high exposure to volatility in oil prices.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Table: Fiscal Breakeven Oil price for various GCC countries</strong>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Break-even_Oil_price_Fig1.jpg" alt="Fiscal Breakeven Oil price for various GCC countries" width="800" height="762" />
<span style="color: #696969; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;">Source: IMF</span></p></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">According to Economist Intelligence Unit, Brent crude oil prices are expected to be USD 66 per barrel (pb) in 2021. Thereafter, from 2023 oil prices are expected to slide down owing to the fact that OPEC+ will not be able to hold production cuts for a longer horizon while demand is expected to remain muted globally. At this level, only Qatar and UAE will have comfortable budgets, while all other GCC countries will have to incur deep fiscal deficits. Debt burden of the GCC nations could surmount as a result, if economic diversification program does not succeed. Oil continues to contribute for more than 50% of the total revenue for GCC nations.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>2. How can GCC countries manage an increasing BEOP?</strong>
In order to reduce the over reliance on oil revenues, it is important for the GCC governments to diversify the economy. Typical to most GCC economic models, the government dominates the oil and financial sectors in the country. The oil revenue in the past has helped GCC governments to create large sovereign wealth funds. However, this economic model appears to be unsustainable in the medium to long term into the future. Hence, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar have chalked out their individual economic diversification programs. The UAE is considered to be one of frontrunners in achieving some of its targets – Dubai is one of the most diversified economy within the GCC. Financial services, tourism, IT and ITeS and technology are some sectors that are gaining traction in the UAE. For instance, UAE runs pilot projects on blockchain. While this is positive, other economies have struggled to reap tangible benefits in terms of economic diversification. This is also evident from the fact that most GCC countries rank poorly in terms of Ease of Doing Business that deters both domestic and foreign private investors from investing in GCC.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Table: Ease of doing business - Overall rankings</strong>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Break-even_Oil_price_Fig2.jpg" alt="Ease of doing business - Overall rankings" width="800" height="762" />
<span style="color: #696969; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;">Source: World Bank - Ease of doing business rankings </span></p></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">In terms of taxation, GCC countries only have 5% value added tax (VAT). It is unlikely for the GCC to impose new taxes such as income tax or increase corporate taxes as it will further dampen the position of the nation in terms of attractiveness to foreign investors. Hence, direct revenue diversification appears to be difficult.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>3. Which GCC countries are comfortably positioned and which ones are vulnerable?</strong>
While GCC states have made considerable progress in the last few years, barring UAE and Bahrain other countries still perform poorly. Implementing some progressive economic reforms such as large-scale privatization, reduction of government jobs to nationals and reducing benefits offered to citizens have faced resistance. This implies that progress in terms of improving the ‘Ease of Doing Business’ in the GCC states would be slow.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>4. Is the recent oil rally expected to cushion borrowing requirements of GCC countries?</strong>
Oil prices have rebounded and are now hovering around the pre-COVID peak levels. This is bound to improve realisations for the GCC countries resulting in lower borrowing requirements to meet budgeted expenditures. According to Moody’s higher oil prices will reduce the immediate government borrowing and external financing needs of GCC sovereigns, most significantly for Kuwait, Oman and Qatar. In another study from Goldman Sachs, the aggregate GCC net borrowing requirement over the next three years could fall from just over $270 billion with crude at $45 per barrel to under $10bn at $65 per barrel – all else remaining equal.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>5. How this metric can be used for stock market analysis?</strong>
With oil being the primary driver of financial well-being of GCC countries, S&P GCC Composite index has mimicked the movement in oil prices since 2014, indicating a correlation of 0.78 between oil prices and the GCC stock markets. In summary, the oil prices movement could be used to predict the direction of the stock market performance.</p>

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Interview with Mr. M.R.Raghu, CEO, Marmore MENA Intelligence</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>How big is GCC Asset Management industry and who are the major players?</strong>
The GCC Asset Management Industry manages around USD 59 billion in assets, spread across 223 funds across the region. The Saudi asset management industry leads the region managing 87% of the assets and having 57% of the funds domiciled in the country. Kuwait comes in at a distant second, having 5% of the total AUM domiciled in the county. Money market funds dominate the region followed by equities whereas assets like real estate, fixed income and other alternatives form a minor share. NCB Capital is the largest player in the region with AUM of around USD 15 billion followed by Riyad Capital with AUM of USD 14 billion. The industry’s top 7 players are based in Saudi Arabia having a cumulative AUM of USD 46 billion, representing 79% of the total GCC AUM. Kuwait Financial Centre, the parent company of Marmore MENA Intelligence, is the leading player in Kuwait, having a total AUM of USD 916 million.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>How asset managers should evolve new product opportunities for the GCC region?</strong>
In the current digital-savvy times, consumers, especially HNIs, are not dependent on relationship managers alone to get educated about various products. Asset Management Companies (AMCs) in the GCC have also begun adopting digital solutions to serve customers, which along with offering tailor-made solutions will prove to be decisive factors over the next couple of years. With a growing demand for alternative products (Real Estate, Commodities, PE, VC securitization etc.) in the region, AMCs should strive to provide related products in the current low-interest rate environment where returns on money market funds have been affected. Effective analysis of risk-return profiles and structuring diversification opportunities, thereby creating multi-asset solutions will also be key. The pandemic, which has forced GCC governments to tap debt markets has created a market with ample supply of government bonds and sukuks for potential investors. Attractive yields, along with a sound credit rating has also attracted investors attention which should be capitalized by AMCs. Asset managers in the region play the safe-game and offer mostly vanilla products that have been in the market for decades and the investments are held to maturity due to the lack of an active secondary trading market. Even large AMCs do not try to offer creative products that might attract the attention of the new generation investors.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>In your opinion, what are the key challenges for investment management firms in GCC?</strong>
Managed funds or discretionary portfolio management still continue to dominate the AUMs of AMCs in the region since HNIs continue to prefer the private banking route. However, the adoption of newer products and solutions would aid in reducing this mismatch. A long-standing issue for the industry is the prevalence of funds which are much smaller in size when compared to global peers. A predominant portion of existing funds are less than USD 50 million in size, due to which operating costs are high, thus eating up margins. A lack of effective distribution channels and over-dependence on AMC’s parent banks to market the funds continue to impact the industry. However, the adoption of digital solutions should help in alleviating this challenge to an extent.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>How is the landscape for discretionary portfolio management in the GCC?</strong>
Discretionary Portfolio Management (DPM) solutions are generally offered to HNIs and institutional investors which are tailored made to suit the investor’s risk-return objectives. Capital market reforms enacted by GCC stock market regulators have resulted in indices entering emerging market indices, along with an increase in the percentage of shares that QFIs can invest in, resulting in the introduction of more private funds. According to Marmore’s recent research on DPM in Saudi Arabia, the number of private funds in the kingdom has increased from 274 in 2015 to 403 as on Q3 2020, reflecting a growth of 47%. However, the AUM has remained flat in the same period, which could indicate that the newer DPM investors could be from a younger population base with lower net worth. The leading asset managers of DPM and private funds are the asset management arms of leading commercial banks. The demand for DPM is bound to increase as investors look to diversify, however, a culture and trust issue still exists in the region which would take time to evolve into the industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Can you elaborate on how Marmore supports asset managers in the GCC region?</strong>
Being the wholly owned subsidiary of the largest Asset Management Company in Kuwait, Marmore has a wealth of expertise in the industry backing it. Our repository of reports spanning a number of verticals such as economy, capital markets, sectors and policy has aided the asset management industry to get access to intelligent analysis that is hard to find in a less researched region.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With its ongoing research efforts, Marmore has also advised Asset Managers on new product launches. Overall Marmore provides end-to-end services to asset managers right from portfolio construction, risk assessment, back testing and buy/sell-side equity research. We have assisted various asset management companies to prepare buy-side equity research reports based on thorough evaluation of the target companies. We have also helped AMCs to prepare stock screeners based on various parameters, create a database of funds with in-depth details and prepare risk reports. We can also help brokerage firms to prepare sell-side equity valuation models and research reports for their clients. We can also provide dedicated offshore analysts to our clients on a full-time basis working with them exclusively. Our research report on equity risk premium is very popular among asset management companies.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Marmore assisted investment banks on various tasks such as preparing due diligence reports, preparing pitch books and provide tailor-made sector/industry research. Our quarterly report on M&A activities in the region are well received by investment banks.</p>[:ar]<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Interview with Mr. M.R.Raghu, CEO, Marmore MENA Intelligence</strong></p>

		<Title>[:en]How can GCC Banks reset for growth beyond COVID-19?[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Interview with Mr. M.R.Raghu, CEO, Marmore MENA Intelligence</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong> How GCC banks reset for growth beyond the COVID-19 crisis?</strong>
The performance of the GCC banking sector had already started to get impacted before the coronavirus pandemic on account of global economic issues, however, the whole situation got exacerbated rapidly on account of the pandemic. For instance, UAE listed banks’ cumulative net income in 2020 witnessed the first negative growth in over 5 years, falling by 42% over 2019 on account of higher loan loss provisions, which grew by 68% over 2019, and falling interest incomes (-13%) and non-interest incomes (-16%) over the last year. Consumers’ behaviour has undergone a transformation with the quick adoption of digital banking and e-commerce during the pandemic. This trend is likely to extend beyond the pandemic and well into the future given the ease of access. Adoption of digital technologies, e-commerce and fintech could spur the utilization of internet banking, mobile banking and mobile wallets rather than physical cash and credit cards. This would present banks with the opportunity to collaborate with existing e-commerce and fintech players to provide additional benefits to customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong> How could the banks profitably serve SMEs?</strong>
In the GCC, SMEs constitute close to 90% of the total companies’ base. The sector has the potential to generate 22 million employment opportunities by 2022 in the region. The strategic importance of SMEs is apparent in some GCC states, with the UAE relying on SMEs for 53% of the national GDP and 60% of the employment. Marmore estimates that SMEs constitute around 89% of the total enterprises in Kuwait while employing 38.5% of the total workforce. Access to credit is one of the major concerns faced by SMEs in the region. SMEs suffer a lack of credit lines, with banks unwilling to lend to smaller businesses at a time of squeezed liquidity. Banks could work on deploying a customized framework to assess and segment SME customers and look at aspects beyond size and revenue and consider other aspects such as business model, sector potential, stage of business operations etc. to develop a holistic understanding of the SME. This would aid banks to offer services beyond traditional products and broaden the range of offerings. Automation and digitalization of the entire lending process – from pre-qualification, credit rating evaluation, underwriting and credit decisions – would allow to speed up the lending activities and shortening time-to-money. Credit Guarantees, like the one offered by the Abu Dhabi government, could also help banks in reducing the risks associated with SME lending.  </p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong> Could Kuwait’s new Mortgage law infuse fresh life into home financing?</strong>
A new Mortgage Law has been proposed by the Central Bank of Kuwait which would allow local banks to provide mortgage loan to up to KD140,000 with the government bearing the interest for the first KD70,000 on behalf of the borrower. Under current circumstances, Kuwaiti newlyweds are eligible to receive housing loans from the government backed Kuwait Credit Bank to the tune of KD100,000 (split as KD70,000 cash and KD30,000 worth building materials at subsidized rates) with no interest. However, with housing prices in Kuwait among the highest in the world, coupled with low oil prices impacting Kuwait Credit Bank’s ability to finance such housing loans has opened up opportunities for local banks to fund such loans. The passage of the law could aid local banks to engage in a new sector with the risk partly being taken care of by the government. A larger loan size would also aid in creating more demand for real estate, potentially increasing the number of apartments for sale.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong> RoE has nearly halved for Kuwait banks since COVID-19. How could banks unearth value and boost their valuation? </strong>
Kuwaiti banks reported a 53% decline in cumulative net profits in 2020 over 2019 as per data provided by Refinitiv. This has been mainly due to the increase in provisions and impairment charges for bad loans caused by COVID-19’s disruption to the economy. As result, the aggregate Provision Coverage Ratio (PCR) for non-performing loans increased to 222% at the end of 2020, while the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans reached about 2%. Fitch Ratings, an international credit rating agency, revised the outlook for 11 Kuwaiti banks to Negative from Stable in Feb 2021. The rebound in oil prices and the eventual normalising of the economy due to vaccinations may see an improvement in bank’s performance in 2021. With relatively stronger balance sheets, and various measures adopted by the Central Bank in relaxing liquidity requirements could aid in banks getting back to normal with an improving economy. Adoption of digitization and partnering with fintech firms to avail digital services would also add value to customers. The banking sector could also witness consolidation to cut costs and address liquidity shortages in order to better safeguard itself from similar situations in the future.
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong> How has Marmore helped Banks in the region?  </strong>
Banking being the most important sector for any economy has been at the forefront of Marmore’s services. Since our inception, we have partnered with several Banks in the region and have provided unique services which caters to information/intelligence needs of these institutions. Some of the services and engagements with Banks includes providing timely sector research. These reports take a deep dive into different sectors and provide the required knowledge to Banks for decision making. We are very active on the consulting front as well, be it market intelligence requirements wherein we do a detailed competition mapping or a market penetration strategy to enter a new market, we continue to be preferred partners for Banks. We also support Banks with white labelled research, which is used to present the Bank’s opinion in the market. Marmore also helps banks by providing customized research on trends impacting the sector. For instance, Marmore produced an in-depth research on the adoption of Fintech in the region along with evaluating the ability of banks in adopting the recent advancements in Fintech. Marmore also produced a customized take on the status of SMEs in the region, analysing the current and possible future trends that could impact the SMEs and the potential impact on the banking sector.  We take pride in associating ourselves with big brands in this segment. </p>[:]]]></Content>

		<Title>[:en]The Archegos Lesson: Bring Risk Management to where it belongs[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">The biggest lesson from Archegos fiasco is that risk management function should not be a side-kick and should be manned by independent, non-partisan executives who will not bend come what may. While this can slow down the growth, at least the institution will survive to analyze. If not, the board meetings will only happen in corporate cemeteries!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While 99% of today’s news is centered around COVID-19 and its multiple waves across the world, on March 23, 2021 a hedge fund blow-up rattled US and global markets thanks to the little known name called Archegos s (a Greek word, which means “someone who leads the way”). Based in New York, Archegos family office is a hedge fund owned and managed by Bill Hwang, an US immigrant from South Korea. After working with Tiger management (of Robertson fame) Bill Hwang went on to found his own hedge fund to manage his wealth in 2013 with a capital of $200 mn. He managed a long-short portfolio (mainly long), which comprised technology stocks focused on Asian geography. The initial success of Archegos was mainly on star-studded technology names like Amazon, Linkedln, and Netflix. Emboldened by its success, Bill moved to take bets on lesser known technology names like ViacomCBS, Farfetch, Iqiyi, Vipstop, etc. Over time, his successful bets enabled him to grow his firm from $200 mn to $20 bn without the attendant limelight normally associated with such star managers. The fact that Bill remained a lowprofile little-known hedge fund manager speaks volumes about his modus operandi which I explain in the following paragraphs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Archegos built a portfolio of mainly Asian technology stocks through Total Return Swaps (TRS) with prime brokers. In this arrangement, the prime broker buys the designated stocks (called portfolio) and swaps the return of the portfolio with Archegos for a fee. Technically, the portfolio risk is assumed by Archegos while prime brokers make money through the fees but end up holding the stocks in their books. Additionally, the prime broker also lends money to Archegos to lever up the portfolio and earns interest on this leverage. Archegos dealt with several reputed prime brokers including Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, Nomura, Wells Fargo, Deutsche Bank and Mitsubishi.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Where things went wrong?</strong>
So, what went wrong? As they say, the party can last as long as the music is playing. In leveraged bets, everyone makes money when the underlying stock price keeps moving up. Technically in that situation, the portfolio value moves up where the investment bank will hand over the profit to Archegos in return for a fixed fee. The increasing value of the portfolio positions Archegos even more favourably now to borrow more and lever up even further. However, the real fun starts when the opposite happens. When the underlying stock price tanks, the exposed investment bank will now demand more collateral from Archegos. If not provided, then it will resort to margin call by selling the underlying stocks and reducing its exposure. This triggers a price fall.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In this particular case study of Archegos, the exposure to ViacomCBS turned sour. After experiencing a tripling in price of the stock, the company decided to tap the market for additional funding in the form of stocks and convertible bonds mainly to shore up liquidity and face intense competition. While the company thought that it is a smart move since it is raising equity at elevated valuation, the market thought otherwise. The stock price of ViacomCBS tanked 9% on March 23rd and 23% on March 24th. Since Archegos has a concentrated portfolio, it triggered panic among the lenders who rushed to sell the portfolio which further reduced the value of all the underlying stocks. Finally, some investment banks escaped with little losses, while Credit Suisse and Nomura were left licking $4.7 billion and $2 billion in losses respectively. Also, Archegos as a firm crumbled to the floor and what was a $20 billion liquid empire came to naughts in about 2 days.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6367" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Nursing-Losses.jpg" alt="Nursing Losses" width="840" height="322" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6367" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/The-Big-Banks-exposure-to-the-Archegos-crash.jpg" alt="The Big Banks exposure to the Archegos crash" width="840" height="322" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are several interesting risk management lessons from this Archegos saga.</p>

<ol class="rdetails_list" style="text-align: left;">
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol class="rdetails_list" style="text-align: left;">
 	<li style="text-align: left;">Use of Leverage: Hedge funds love to make money through leverage especially in times like these where rates are near zero. Leverage is a double-edged sword where it can amplify both profits and losses. Archegos started with a normal leverage of 2x and when it tasted success, kept increasing the leverage and before the blow up the leverage stood at a massive 5x. Well governed hedge funds and institutions will have internal checks and balances that will limit the leverage in anticipation of troubles. However, Archegos being a single man company, did not enjoy that luxury.</li>
 	<li style="text-align: left;">Use of Derivative Products: Archegos did not directly own the underlying stocks but instead owned them indirectly through the prime brokers through the swaps described earlier. In this method, it can escape regulatory scrutiny as regulators cannot find out the positions being built up by Archegos. Also, Archegos can work with several prime brokers at the same time. While each prime broker can have his exposure worked out, they will not have a composite view of Archegos total exposure to a particular stock.</li>
 	<li style="text-align: left;">Lending is a risky business: From the prime brokers point of view, lending is a juicy business as they are covered by the underlying stocks as collateral and can always demand more (margins) when needed. However, this works well for small changes in stock prices. However, for large and abrupt changes in stock price (especially on the down side) lending can be a serious business if proper due diligence is ignored while lending.</li>
 	<li style="text-align: left;">Concentrated portfolios can be dangerous: Archegos ran a highly concentrated portfolio both at a stock level and at sector level. Ignoring the benefits of portfolio diversification can cause serious problems in sudden market meltdowns. Running a concentrated portfolio that too on a levered basis will need very high levels of stock research and ability to withstand long periods of “against the wind” scenarios. In hedge funds run by a single person like Archegos, both these factors can be missing.</li>
 	<li style="text-align: left;">Swimming with Sharks: Prime brokers, in spite of their big names, end up dealing with firms like Archegos where risk management is thrown out of the window. Unless risk management is at the central of such investment bank’s business model, swimming with sharks will not be pleasant all the time and can end very badly. Most of the big prime brokers cited in this article embraced Archegos as a client in spite of SEC slapping fines on Bill when he was with Tiger. It is anybody’s guess how this was completely ignored in the risk management due diligence.</li>
 	<li style="text-align: left;">Don’t wait for the client to decide: Upto what point one can wait to trigger a margin call is a subjective question especially when dealing with stocks that has manageable interim volatility. When several prime brokers are involved in lending to the same client for the same stock, a steep fall in the underlying stock price will put them in a situation where if one pulls the trigger, the whole ship can fall. Before pulling the trigger, prime brokers normally consult the client to see if additional comfort can be obtained in the form of higher collateral or margin money. In most of such situations, the client instead of putting up with additional collateral, will try and argue about the correctness of his call and punctuate the need to maintain patience. This can be a recipe for disaster. The biggest risk management lesson here is not to wait for the client’s decision.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Risk management back in focus</strong>
Investment management business is fiercely competitive and the first casualty of this is the risk management. Risk management is a critical function for both the hedge funds and the lending institutions. In many institutions, the unfortunate truth is that risk management is seen more as an irksome middlemen function preventing the business from growing. Some institutions veer around this problem by assigning ex-business heads to lead the risk management function so that they can have a ‘friendly’ attitude to investing decisions like enrolling risky clients or endorsing risky transactions. Needless to say, risk management function should not be a side-kick and should be manned by independent, nonpartisan executives who will not bend come what may. While this can slow down the growth, at least the institution will survive to analyze. If not, the board meetings will only happen in corporate cemeteries! </p>[:]]]></Content>

		<Title>[:en]Importance of SMEs in GCC: Challenges amid COVID and way forward[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Interview with Mr. M.R.Raghu, CEO, Marmore MENA Intelligence</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Are SMEs very important for the GCC region? How have SMEs contributed to the region?</strong>
Small-to-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are vital to the economic development of the country as they foster innovation, entrepreneurship and create large-scale employment opportunities. The subject of SMEs touches upon many aspects of a nation’s economic network. By its very nature, SMEs can sprout up anywhere along the output value chain of a country, ranging from small shops to cutting edge research teams. In the GCC, SMEs constitute close to 90% (i.e. about 1.5 million SMEs) of the total companies’ base. The sector has the potential to generate 22 million employment opportunities by 2022 in the region. The strategic importance of SMEs is apparent in some GCC states, with the UAE relying on SMEs for 53% of the national GDP and 60% of the employment. SMEs account for over 99% of the private sector in Saudi Arabia, contributing to over 28% of the GDP in 2018 and 64% of the total employment. Qatar SMEs contributed to around 10% of the GDP, which is one of the lowest in the GCC. In Oman and Bahrain, SMEs contribute to around 15% and 28% of GDP respectively.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The pandemic impacted major economies across the world, how did GCC SMEs fare?</strong>
The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has weighed down the local and regional SME ecosystems. SMEs constituting part of sectors such as wholesale and retail trade, food and beverage, hospitality, tourism and travel have been especially hit hard due to the pandemic. Lockdowns and border closures had also led to a massive exodus of expatriates (both voluntary and due to layoffs) across the GCC economies, which has further caused a dent to SMEs in the region. With expatriates forming a large part of the population in the GCC, SMEs took a double hit from the consumption and employment perspectives. However, policy actions and stimulus measures provided by the respective governments and central banks have helped SMEs in the region to recover.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>How can GCC Governments support the SMEs in the region? What steps have already been taken?</strong>
SMEs generally have a high cash burn rate due to which they require constant funding. With the current situation impacting revenues, GCC governments should look at supporting them during this crisis. SMEs suffer a lack of credit lines, with banks unwilling to lend to smaller businesses at a time of squeezed liquidity. For instance, in Kuwait, estimated lending in the sector being around KD 1.3billion represents a 3.6% of overall credit outstanding, compared to around 30% for the OECD countries. Various measures such as tax holidays, soft-loans, rent waivers and even paying employee salaries in some cases have already been taken in this regard. The Central Bank of UAE (CBUAE) had recently issued regulations to support SMEs and promote best practices for Licensed Financial Institutions (LFIs) while engaging with SMEs. Emirates Development Bank (EDB) announced a USD8.2bn financing plan to support SMEs in the country. SME Dubai, the agency charged with boosting start-ups, has rolled out new initiatives to help companies seeking to ride out the pandemic, with offers of rent holidays and improved access to financing. Saudi Arabia, with aims to increase SMEs contribution to 35% of GDP by 2030, has facilitated further access to funding by encouraging financial institutions to allocate up to 20% of overall loans to them. Kuwait’s National Fund for SME Development (The SME Fund) and Kuwaiti banks have been advised to provide loans on concessional basis to SMEs. Bahrain announced a USD1.5 billion stimulus package targeting households and companies along with subsidizing electricity bills for SMEs. Oman implemented tax relief measures, a 3-months tax deferral in payments and exemption from fees and taxes for companies part of the most affected sectors.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>What are the new trends within the SME segment?</strong>
The GCC countries, especially UAE, have been investing in digital infrastructure over the past decade. The UAE government plans to develop smart cities, use blockchain technology for government transactions, undertake ambitious financial technology (fintech) projects and launch a Fourth Industrial Revolution Centre. The pandemic has accelerated the need for disruptions in the traditional forms of business and technology adoption. Fintech is one area where there is significant interest from startups, especially in UAE and Saudi Arabia. The pandemic situation and the subsequent cautiousness of shopping physically caused a dramatic shift in the consumption patterns with demand for online retail spiking. This spurt in online commerce has impacted the logistics sector with startups in third-party logistics space providing home-deliveries and a better last-mile delivery mechanism sprouting across the region. The adoption of technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), driverless vehicles, drones, artificial intelligence etc. are gaining traction and are expected to be the disruptors that can impact SMEs going forward.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>How can Marmore help SMEs? </strong>
Marmore’s published research division, having a database of over 800 reports across various business domains and sectors, have been a good source of information to SMEs in the region. These reports help in understanding the current trends impacting sectors along with providing a future outlook for the same. Marmore also helps SMEs by providing customized research which would involve primary research to get deeper insights on the sector. With funding being a major challenge for SMEs, Marmore helps SMEs to prepare detailed financial models along with providing a financial valuation of their businesses, prepare reports and pitchbooks that are used to obtain funding from banks, venture capitalists and private equity firms. Marmore also helps conduct feasibility studies for SMEs that are looking to enter new markets.</p>[:]]]></Content>

		<Title>[:en]Oil Price Move yet to lift Saudi Aramco’s Share Price[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">Saudi Aramco the blue chip of Saudi Arabia and the world’s largest oil company took a drop in its stride last year post Covid-19 as oil demand slumped and OPEC+ which is led by Saudi Arabia agreed to sharp cut in oil exports by 9.7mmbpd effective May 2020 from an October 2018 baseline (with Saudi output cut from 12.3 mmbpd in March 2020 to 8.5 mmbpd) to shore up and stabilize the oil prices in the international market. In line with this slump in oil prices Saudi Aramco stock price also fell to a low of USD 26.09 on March 15th, 2020 but recovered in the second half of 2020 to USD 36.95 on September 20th, 2020 with reduction of oil export cuts due to improvement in global economic conditions. Since then though COVID impact has been on the decline despite local lockdowns in several countries continue to exist and with the global economic recovery the oil market has been on a steady rise with oil prices recovering by 34% to reach levels of around USD 69 per barrel in the current year. However, Saudi Aramco share price continues to remain subdued at USD36 (ytd of 1.6%) and has not participated in the stock price rally that several Saudi blue chips witnessed due to improving economic conditions and aided further by the liquidity splurge globally in the stock markets. This raises the question of what are the factors holding back the stock price.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For the quarter ended March 31, 2021 net income was SAR78.6bn ($21bn), up 24 per cent year-on-year and higher than analysts’ average estimate of roughly $19bn. Free cash flow was $18.3bn. The company expects capital expenditure to be $35bn in 2021, a figure unchanged from its forecast in March. The management commentary is upbeat if we read: “There are more reasons to be optimistic that better days are coming,” CEO Amin Nasser said in a statement (Bloomberg May 5, 2021).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The upstream business, mainly consisting of oil and gas production, saw earnings before interest and tax rise 6.4 per cent to $40bn. While it was buoyed by higher energy prices, Saudi Arabia’s OPEC commitments meant Aramco reduced crude output during the quarter to an average of 8.6 million barrels a day which is stated to be the lowest in a decade.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Aramco’s consolidated downstream business, which now includes operations of SABIC in which the Company acquired 70% shareholding, swung to a profit as higher commodity prices boosted margins for refined products such as transport fuels and plastics. The downstream activities’ earnings before interest and tax were $4.4bn, compared with a loss of $5bn a year earlier. These activities, which Aramco wants to expand further, posted full-year losses in 2019 and 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, Aramco’s Downstream segment, consumed 43.8% (Q1 2020: 35.5%) of Aramco’s crude oil production.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Are the low output volumes of Upstream business and the poor historical performance of the downstream business the black sheep behind Saudi Aramco share price paralysis is the question?  Or will they turn to be the torch bearer of a recovery as global prices of downstream products improve with the global economic revival from the COVID pandemic also aided by higher volumes in Upstream business upon the proposed lifting of OPEC+ crude oil quotas.</p>

		<Title>[:en]UAE’s 100% foreign ownership will boost investor confidence, cut cost of operations[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">The UAE’s announcement of 100 per cent foreign ownership across the board effective June 1, is touted as game changing and a master stroke. This was the biggest demand from various business councils for decades. The current system requires 51 per cent local sponsorship along with majority representation in the board with the Chair being Emirati. In a country where more than 80 per cent of the population are expats and where the economy is fairly better diversified than their GCC counterparts, opening the ownership gates cannot be timed better.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Covid’s multiple waves are wrecking a havoc on global economies including the UAE whose GDP is expected to shrink by 6.6 per cent (IMF) with the widest budget deficit on record. It has also resulted in exodus of expats due to job losses which has resulted in the population numbers falling by 10 per cent with heavy economic consequences. Attracting expats and tourists back will need considerable investment led economic revival. While the UAE has been fairly successful in attracting FDI’s, they are mostly in the oil and gas sector followed by digital economy. Being a service economy and world’s tourism destination, the UAE can certainly do well to attract more FDI’s across several other sectors and this reform is exactly aimed at that. Also, Expo 2020 is round the corner and will need conducive business environment to make that happen effectively.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A business reform like 100 per cent foreign ownership across the board can really be the icing on the cake as it improves investor confidence and also reduce cost of operations, which is a key business requirement. With a visa-friendly regime now in place, the business environment is now at its compelling best.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On the flip side though, the business model of free zones will come under intense pressure where it used to be the only place where 100 per cent foreign ownership is allowed. There are over a dozen free trade zones in the UAE and they have been fairly successful compared to other free zones in GCC.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It will be interesting to see if other GCC countries, especially Saudi Arabia will follow suit. While the need to attract FDI can be important for all GCC countries, many of them have ring-fenced their local population in an attempt to improve employment opportunities for locals.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Response to Covid pandemic has been very different across the globe. Many advanced economies are directly putting money in the pockets of people in what is termed as fiscal stimulus. They are also getting generous help from the Central banks which has promised to keep interest rates low for a good amount of time in the future. However, emerging markets response has been mostly in the form of reforms as they lack the deep pockets to put money directly in the hands of citizens. Also, global economies have started looking inward post Covid. Bringing back the supply chain, global transportation and tourism will certainly take more time than anticipated. This will have significant impact on trade and FDI’s for many countries in the world. UAE has positioned itself as a global trade hub and hence trade runs as the central nerve. In that scenario, opening up the economy ahead of others through such reforms can be considered not only timely but sagacious in terms of opening the trade gates. UAE is certainly showing the way for the world.</p>

		<Title>[:en]Importance of Fintech amid COVID-19[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Interview with Mr. M.R.Raghu, CEO, Marmore MENA Intelligence</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Has the role of Fintech become more critical, given the pandemic? </strong>
With the subsequent waves of the COVID-19 in place, it might take longer than expected for the situation to get back to absolute normalcy. This puts a spotlight on the increasing need for digitisation with Fintech. COVID-19 has certainly fast tracked Fintech adoption, which is very much evident from the data points. According to Mastercard, in MEA region contactless payments has increased by 70% indicating surge in the use of Fintech apps during the COVID-19 global health crisis. In Bahrain use of BenefitPay, a smartphone payments app surged by over 1,000% during the pandemic, with the current registered users representing 28% of the total population. According to PWC, KSA eCommerce platforms Bin Dawood and Danube benefited from online shopping using smartphones with their average sales increasing by 200%, while in the UAE, Carrefour saw a 59% rise in new online customers, since the beginning of outbreak. Moving away from traditional means COVID-19 poses huge challenges for banks, highlighting need for fast paced technological adoption and innovation in sync with the Fintech sector.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>What would be an ideal ecosystem for the development of Fintech in GCC? </strong>
The key elements of the Fintech ecosystem are talent, government support, funding, and Physical infrastructure (shared spaces, ICT). A study as carried out by S&P Global states that the GCC countries are the most ready for Fintech adoption within Middle East and Africa region. In terms of talent (Human Capital), the region still lags behind countries with the same income level. World Bank study cites that a child born today in the GCC will attain only between 56% and 67% of his or her full health and learning potential and therefore potential productivity by age 18. Talent needs to be nurtured by providing adequate education and training, GCC needs to develop in-house talent pool and provide sufficient opportunities within Fintech space. On regulatory front, the GCC regulators are taking appropriate steps for example, Saudi Arabia aims to reach an e-payment target of 70 per cent by 2030. In January 2021, Saudi Arabia announced that SAMA would go live with its open banking initiative during the first half of 2022, which is expected to facilitate various Fintech services. Bahrain is very active in this regards, putting in place regulations to cover regulatory sandboxes, open banking, crypto-assets, and robo-advisory and payment services. Funding also has been facilitated by various Government initiatives like the DIFC in 2017 launched a $100 million fund to help establish, grow, and upscale start-up and growth stage fintech firms. Similarly, Bahrain Development Bank and the Economic Development Board of Bahrain have launched two separate funds of $100 million each to support Fintech. In terms of infrastructure the GCC region leads Middle East and Africa in terms of internet penetration and basic infrastructure which is reflected in higher ranking for World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Index, this provides the much needed infrastructure support for Fintech expansion.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>What are the latest development in the region within the Fintech space? </strong>
Some of the notable developments in the Fintech space were as follows:
<ul class="rdetails_list" style="text-align: left;">
 	<li>Western Union announced in November 2020, that it has agreed to buy a 15% minority stake in stc pay at an overall valuation of $1.3bn. stc pay is the first Fintech unicorn valued at more than $1bn in the Middle East, this transaction marks the development of the regional Fintech market, and brings its potential to the attention of international investors.</li>
 	<li>UAE based NOW Money secured $7 million funding to expand its business GCC</li>
 	<li>Recently, Saudi Arabia-based Tamara, a Buy Now, Pay Later service provider, confirmed that it has finalized a $110 million Series A funding.</li>
</ul></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Likewise, the GCC region is abuzz with news related to funding of Fintechs, which is a very healthy sign.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>What are the key risks associated with Fintech adoption that the region should be wary about?</strong>
Though Fintech brings a lot of convenience and benefits for the society at large, but one also needs to be aware of the potential risks and take appropriate actions to mitigate it. One of the most critical risk for Fintech would be to deal with the regulatory changes. Fintech will also have to consider differing regulations in multiple territories should they operate internationally. Cyber threats like theft and data breaches are also important risks that Fintech needs to tackle, as any slippage here could cost them dearly. In 2017, Equifax one of the three largest consumer credit reporting agency in USA, had a security breach wherein it lost personal details of 145 million Americans due to a website application vulnerability. In GCC, amid the pandemic the cyberattacks have gone up considerably for the region, particularly for UAE which saw an increase in cyberattacks by 250% in 2020. Technology failure is yet another major risk, as it can mean customers are unable to access services.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>How has Marmore contributed within this space? </strong>
Marmore has always been on the forefront in terms of highlighting the importance of Fintech in the region. We at Marmore understand both finance and technology very well and this blend provides us with the capabilities to deliver on varying client requirements.

		<Title>[:en]GCC retail sector in the post-covid world: Bound for a “K” shaped recovery[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">The pandemic has changed the lives of billions of global citizens. Businesses have been forced to adopt new ways of functioning. The post pandemic world is expected to be never like before and experts have christened it as the “new-normal”. The GCC retail sector is no exemption to this. Being one of the region’s important sector for the economy, the retail sector has witnessed one of its worst performance in 2020. GCC retail sector, unlike in other regions, is not just a source of shopping but is a source of entertainment.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While the overall consumer and retail sector has been adversely affected by the pandemic, it has been a mixed of bag of challenges with fewer opportunities for various stakeholders.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is evident that the COVID-19 pandemic is having an impact of varying degree and magnitude. Some sub-sectors are witnessing an uptick, while some sub-sectors are going through a slump. This is termed as a “K” shaped recovery for the GCC retail sector.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Luxury and Fashion retailing:</strong> Luxury and fashion retailing has been severely impacted by the Covid-19 crisis. For most players, sales were down by 20-50% immediately after the onset of the pandemic and is yet to revive. While malls are reopening slowly in the GCC, visits to malls are yet to reach pre-pandemic levels. Luxury retail – expensive electronics, gems and jewelry – is another sector that is hit hard by the pandemic. Lack of discretionary spending by GCC residents and a steep decline in tourists purchases have led to receding revenues for the segment.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Food and Beverage (F&B):</strong> Dining out –had the severe impact amongst the retail sector. Many restaurants remained closed for a prolonged period during the pandemic. Many companies in the GCC have adopted to food delivery to meet the changing consumer perceptions, but this is not enough to make up for their revenue losses.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Food and Beverages</strong> – mainly dine in restaurants are expected to have a long-lasting negative impact. Restaurants are at the heart of social life in big cities of the region and fine dining places are the most impacted by the shutdown. People are still hesitant to visit restaurants. Deep dip in tourist arrivals in the GCC region is another reason for the decline in revenues of the dine in restaurant businesses in the region. Many GCC retailers have witnessed bulk buying – stock keeping by consumers as a trend during the pandemic and thereafter. Working from home has led to an increase in the consumption.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>E-commerce/One line retailing is expected to be one of the major benefiters of the COVID-19 pandemic in the GCC.</strong> Many e-commerce platforms that cater to the grocery needs in GCC have witnessed ~ 50% increase in app downloads and orders. Carrefour has seen its online marketplace demand multiplied by 6. The pandemic situation and the subsequent cautiousness of shopping physically caused a dramatic shift in the consumption patterns with demand for online retail spiking. With high internet penetration rates and successful adoption of e-payment platforms, the e-commerce industry in the GCC is poised to grow rapidly in the future. AT Kearney predicted that GCC e-commerce would reach a value of over USD 21 billion by the end of 2020. By the end of 2020, the GCC e-commerce reached USD 24 billion – an additional USD 3 billion assisted by the COVID-19 pandemic. GCC’s e-commerce market was projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 14% in the lead up to 2022, and tail off into a 10% CAGR up until 2025. E-commerce growth in the GCC will have its negative impact on the brick and mortar stores partially, according to AT Kearney. The love for physical shopping and its other attractions such as aquarium, ice skating, fountains, various games etc. had been major draws for GCC’s malls for both locals and tourists for over two decades. However, trends are beginning to change with online retail getting a fillip on account of the coronavirus pandemic. Furthermore, deals and discounts offered by online retail players across the year rather than that offered by malls only during festive seasons and special occasions are an attraction to buyers. The e-commerce revolution is expected to have just begun in the region with more players entering the market and providing niche products.</p>

<span style="color: #696969; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;">Source: KPMG</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Any form of Brick and Mortar (B&M) store has been the most negatively affected segment in the GCC during the pandemic. That said, B&M players have started to embrace the online space too. The convergence of online and physical retail has led to a new format called ‘omni-channel retail’ where B&M players venture into the online format. Services such as ‘buy online – collect in store’ and other such related permutations have increased the options for purchasers. Global luxury retailer, Bloomingdale, recently launched its e-commerce platform in the middle east to offer deliveries in UAE, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Abu Dhabi’s Reem Mall has announced plans to develop the world’s first fully enabled offline-to-online shopping centre with connecting all of its 450 stores into an online platform and an aggregated customer app. Majid Al-Futtaim (UAE based real estate and retail conglomerate)has also accelerated the launch of its online platform along with expanding its network of fulfilment centres. Global giant, Carrefour (French multinational retail corporation), has also developed an e-commerce platform to challenge its online rivals.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The post pandemic retail industry in GCC is likely to undergo a paradigm shift with players in the conventional domain competing with e-commerce companies. The retail space will offer more scope for joint ventures and provide appetite for mergers and acquisitions among the traditional brick and mortar players and e-commerce companies. Nevertheless, once vaccinations gather pace and threat of the COVID-19 pandemic recedes, GCC residents are set to return to their mall visits, which also forms a part of recreation. A coexistence between brick and mortar and e-commerce is likely to happen in 2022-23 , with clear advantage set in favour of e-commerce and online retailing in the region.</p>[:]]]></Content>

		<Title><![CDATA[[:en]'COVID-19' a catalyst for EdTech industry in GCC region[:]]]></Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">The EdTech industry is transforming traditional learning methods by blending digital capabilities and the widespread penetration of digital devices within the general population. EdTech platforms have mushroomed to encompass adaptive learning, animated content, gamification, etc (Khaleej Times). The global EdTech market size was valued at USD 89.49 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach USD 106.04 billion in 2021. Which is expected to witness a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.9% from 2021 to 2028 to reach USD 377.85 billion by 2028 (Grand View Research).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is notable that the combined investments in 2018 and 2019 are greater than the total combined investment recorded from 1998 through 2017, a period of quarter century. Within the MENA region too, deals rose from four in 2016 to over 30 in 2019 (Ibid). There is much investment interest too in MENA. MENA EdTech startups raised over USD 30 million in PE and VC funding, for 2020, but that number is increasing rapidly year-on-year (Zawya).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Covid-19 pandemic has affected 91% of the student population worldwide, according to UNESCO, creating unpreceded disruption in global education sector (Arabian Business). Before the pandemic, ushering in tech into education was this added luxury, but now it has become a necessary part of student’s life. Presently, even the government is taking initiative, the UAE government launched its digital teaching platform, madrasa.org, through which it could offer free education to school-aged children, while the Saudi Ministry of Education is broadcasting lessons for all grades on TV and social media channels. Kuwait has followed a similar approach, using the Kuwait Educational channel to provide school students with lessons (Khaleej Times).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Furthermore, the UAE’s Ministry of Education is expected to expand its spend on e-learning initiatives by 60 percent to a worth of USD 7.1 billion by 2023. This is a significant rise considering in 2017 just USD 2 million was invested in EdTech start-ups across the entire MENA region (Arabian Business).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the current and post-pandemic world, EdTech industry will play a greater role; however, it needs huge investments in telecom and infrastructure, faster data connectivity and capacity building. Moreover, Covid-19 has enabled the education sector to realize the strong potential of digital learning (Ibid). Also, due to the challenges that schools are facing due to the lockdown in many parts of the world, EdTech companies have enabled tools and platforms like live doubt-clearing sessions, e-books, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">EdTech can also be used to strategize and tailor the syllabi, addressing the distinct learning interests or specialized learning requirements (Entrepreneur Media ). The potential of EdTech in the GCC is evidenced by Kuwait-based Baims. Founded in 2017, Baims started operations with customized tutoring modules based on university curricula (Wamda). It then expanded its capacities to include multiple colleges and universities in both Kuwait and Riyadh. The startup, reportedly, managed to break even within 24 hours. Another start-up Zedny, which was launched in mid-June 2020 with a USD 1.2 million pre-seed investment, offers Arabic online courses and video summaries of best sellers, applying AI to enhance the user experience. Noon Academy is one of the fastest growing Edu-Tech startup in the Middle East based in Saudi Arabia and Egypt, with over 2 million registered students. The startup raised one of Saudi Arabia's third biggest funding rounds in H1 2020, with a total of USD 13 million and now operates in 8 different countries.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A key enabler for EdTech is the fact that the devices are getting smarter and more efficient (Appinventiv). A web of interconnectivity using big data Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help in driving autonomous customer experiences (CX), adding a highly personalized dimension to EdTech market. Also, the integration of Blockchain Technology allows end-users to store and secure records of students and learners, thereby enabling educators to analyze the consumption patterns of the material offered to the learners(Grand View Research).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are several other emerging benefits of EdTech too. Some of them are (Ibid) –</p>

<ul class="rdetails_list" style="text-align: left;">
 	<li>Digital accessing of education could help ensure a border-less or international experience, helping in the emergence of B2C education distribution channels.</li>
 	<li>With learning material getting remotely accessible, EdTech could catalyze ‘education for all’.</li>
 	<li>Education could be customized to each student, enabling self-paced classes to become commonplace.</li>
 	<li>For those differently abled, innovating customized provisions becomes possible and easier, thus empowering access to quality education.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">Incidentally, EdTech is being seen as a tool for upskilling for a future-ready workforce too (CNBC). It is because education doesn’t just end after college in an era of strident tech disruptions, mandating continuous learning as important to protect jobs in the process. The ongoing pandemic health crisis has made sure that nothing will likely be the same as before the great lockdown (India Today). In education too, online platforms that were once seen as useful supplements to conventional education infrastructure will become deeply mainstream. Undoubtedly, this will change the fashion in which academic content is created, personally consumed and deployed across platforms.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As long as the governments and industries continue to stay open for partnerships and innovation in the EdTech space, we can look forward to education systems that are broader, richer, more sophisticated, and more inclusive. We have seen technology transform the global financial services and retail sectors, and the opportunity that exists for educating and empowering the GCC’s young leaders of tomorrow is even more exciting.</p>[:]]]></Content>

		<Title>[:en]Why business and market intelligence important for GCC corporates?[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Interview with Mr. M.R.Raghu, CEO, Marmore MENA Intelligence</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong> Do GCC companies actively seek market intelligence?</strong>
Private organizations in the GCC often find themselves in a situation where they need to make decisions of considerable importance with substantial consequences under uncertainty. In such scenarios, they seek out more information to enhance their understanding and take calculated risks. The foremost procurers and users of market intelligence, the private sector, obtains research for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from strategic, economic, industry, market to policy, investment etc. Apart from regularly subscribed research reports, private sector is also the main consumer of customized research for specific requirements to address their own business, operational or investment needs. Growth in services industry (financial service, telecom, trade & tourism) and increasing allocation in state budgets by the GCC governments for development of social infrastructure such as educational & training institutions, healthcare facilities has spurred the need for market intelligence by companies operating in these segments. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong> What makes businesses intelligence difficult to procure in GCC? </strong>
The GCC’s business intelligence industry faces a challenge of inadequate availability of updated statistics from national authorities, lack of data from industrial associations and limited disclosures by public companies, thereby limiting the degree of research and by extension its effectiveness. Data/information often comes with significant time lag and is quite often available only in native language. Poor disclosures by publicly listed companies in the GCC about their respective industry statistics in their annual reports have plagued the standard of industry research.  Knowledge economy experts point out the importance of the triple helix model of innovation, i.e., government-industry-university relationships and synergies, in terms of nurturing sustainable economic development. In the GCC, R&D spending, largely, has lagged global peers and is largely dependent on government spending. Technology is increasingly going to be a critical enabler of economic change and competitive advantage. However, in order to understand what a country can do best, R&D spending has to be smart, i.e., it has to be backed up by research that is reliable in identifying suitable industry clusters and innovation ecosystems.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong> In terms of business intelligence consulting, how can one differentiate between hard (like market share) and soft factors (like customer experience)?</strong>
In essence, a business intelligence consultant’s main role is to advise a company on improvements that could be made to its business or organizational effectiveness. Yet, the range of consulting work is extremely varied. Hard data, is defined as data in the form of numbers, graphs and are obtained from various sources such as companies, governments, statistical organizations, industry associations etc. On the other hand, soft data relates to consumer preferences and patterns and are usually derived from primary research conducted by the companies through market research consultants. As access to data continues to grow in the region with the advancements in digital technologies, businesses will need to incorporate both hard and soft data into their solutions for improved, real-time decision support as a way to differentiate their service offerings to ensure that the end consumers get the desired product/service. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong> Do some sectors lend itself to better intelligence scouting than others?</strong>
Considering the strategic importance of oil as an economic resource at a global level and the size of sector in GCC, it remains as the most researched and well understood sector in the region. However, other industries, such as retail, food & beverage, telecom, technology, financial services etc. that have gained prominence in the region over the past couple of decades, have increasingly started using market intelligence to better serve their end customers. For instance, the retail sector in the GCC, traditionally dominated by large shopping malls, have been hit hard due to the coronavirus pandemic along with the sudden spike in traction witnessed in online retail. Such a scenario would lend very well for business intelligence, with data being gleaned from various sources such as retail players, government statistics, end consumers (through primary and secondary research) and consultants. A similar scenario was witnessed in the financial services sector too, with financial technology (fintech) threatening to replace the traditional form of banking. Many banks in the region have turned to market intelligence firms to obtain research on end consumer needs and behaviours and have implemented changes to their business models accordingly. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong> How can Marmore help in providing business intelligence? </strong>
Marmore MENA Intelligence has been providing research services to various clients across the GCC region for well over a decade now. Marmore’s repository of over 800 reports across verticals such as economy, capital markets, sectors and policy have aided various organizations across the globe to get access to intelligent analysis that is hard to find in a less researched region. Marmore’s research, disseminated in various formats, plays a key role for a number of organizations in the GCC looking at various aspects such as new market (sector/geography) entry, product diversification, merger and acquisitions (M&A) etc. Our research reports and customized solutions specifically look into the business environment in detail for competition from other companies, regulatory rules and laws, industry trends, up-to-date technological developments and other facts relevant to the specific product or service. Global Investor, a magazine owned by Euromoney group awarded Marmore MENA Intelligence the title of ‘Research Provider of the Year 2018’. This is a testament to Marmore’s continuous market growth, research innovation and client service leadership. </p>[:]]]></Content>

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Interview with Mr. M. R. Raghu, CEO, Marmore MENA Intelligence</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>What is the market size of private firms in GCC?</strong>
Private firms encompass of any non-listed firms, these firms could be large family run businesses or small and medium enterprises. Private firms have great importance in terms of its contribution to the GDP for their respective economies and for employment generation. In the GCC, SMEs constitute close to 90% (i.e. about 1.5 million SMEs) of the total companies’ base. The sector has the potential to generate 22 million employment opportunities by 2022 in the region. As per a study by Crowe, SME market in the GCC could reach USD920bn in 2023. However, one needs to note that the region has a lot of successful family businesses as well with remarkably high market value.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>What are the various reasons for a private firm to hire consultants to value their businesses? </strong>
As businesses grow, they are often looking for funding to expand their business, this is when an organization approaches a financial institution for loans. Even start-ups are always hungry for funds, as they need corpus to penetrate markets, expand production and take business to the next level. Typical valuation requirements for start-ups stem for subsequent rounds of funding as well. Other requirements could be for mergers and acquisitions where in a company is evaluating options in the market for a possible takeover. Conducting a detailed valuation study addresses the above needs, it also enables a company to recognize a realistic valuation of their firm. Sometimes the conflicts between partners, default on payment obligations and winding up of a business also facilitates a detailed valuation study. Valuation studies are also required by private companies for stake sale.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>What are the key challenges in GCC Countries in terms of valuations? </strong>
GCC region is catching up in terms of more corporates tapping into equity and bond markets for funds. However, many of the large family businesses are not that active on this front. Hence finding relevant valuation comparable for these private companies is often a challenge. Other issue prevalent in the market is that for most of the mergers and acquisitions transactions in the private space valuations are not reported. Disclosure is another key pain point in the region. Corporate disclosures are not uniform, leading to partial disclosures or no information at all. This poses a significant challenge for consultants while attempting to value a company. The willingness to share information in public is low and hence the visibility. Another issue is in the way firms conduct accounting and reporting. Many firms even in the listed space are not reflecting the fair value of their holdings, which makes it even more difficult for financial analyst to value these firms.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>How is the landscape changing, and what more can be done? </strong>
The good news is that there are many local and international players in this space, and the race is further picking up and should lead to adequate competition. A general tendency within GCC firms is to engage only with the selected top International players, while this practice could be more expensive as these firms might be charging a lot of premium for their services, it is also a deterrent to the prospects of other international and local valuation firms. Healthy competition should be encouraged as this will eventually pave way for sustenance of these valuation firms and would also facilitate cost efficient solutions for the clients.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>How has Marmore helped private organizations with financial and valuation consulting? </strong>
Over the years Marmore has helped many clients with valuation services. For one of the clients, Marmore did a valuation exercise for a listed utility company. The issue at hand was that the management was reporting all of its assets and investments on historical book value basis, while the assets and investments had grown significantly over time and didn’t reflect the true value of the company. Furthermore, a subsidiary of the company was even larger than the company itself. Marmore was hired by an investor in the utility company for valuation. Careful evaluation of all the subsidiaries were carried out in terms of line of business each operates in and accordingly each of them were valued. Our valuation report brought out the hidden value of the company in assets and investments, and was presented to the management of the company to make necessary disclosures on the market value of these investments.

For another client we were engaged to value a non-listed company which recently closed a bulk deal. Marmore used its expertise and identified the right valuation of the company by using multiple valuation methods, the client used the valuation report to negotiate better terms with the company. A particular case deserves a special mention, wherein for a listed company, the Government made some significant changes to its revenue recognition model. This change had a long-term impact on the company’s performance and valuation, but given the complexity of the new laws, a proper valuation exercise could not be performed as the market participants sought waiting for more clarity from the management. Marmore stepped in and provided detailed analysis of the new laws and its impact on the company valuation and performance. Marmore’s effort was well appreciated by the client and made the investment call for the client more obvious.</p>[:ar]<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Interview with Mr. M. R.

Marmore stepped in and provided detailed analysis of the new laws and its impact on the company valuation and performance. Marmore’s effort was well appreciated by the client and made the investment call for the client more obvious.</p>[:]]]></Content>

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">This article was originally published in <a href="https://www.islamicfinancenews.com/fresh-listings-could-reinvigorate-islamic-equity-capital-markets.html?access-key=5ef698cd9fe650923ea331c15af3b160" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong><u>Islamic Finance news (IFN)</u></strong></a></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">GCC regional equity markets continue to scale new peaks buoyed by global rally and increasing oil prices. S&P GCC Composite Index, an index, has gained over 20% for the year. Liquidity glut sloshing around global markets has fuelled the rally. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, central banks worldwide eased money supply and increased the availability of credit at near zero interest rates to stem economic fallout.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, the capital has found its way into financial markets, stoking concerns of asset price inflation. Supportive factors such as roll out of vaccination programs and announcement of reform measures have aided the market momentum. The full economic impact of COVID-19 pandemic is yet to be reflected in corporate earnings, as the loan deferral programs have been extended several times to provide relief to SMEs, banks and stressed out sectors. Once the true picture emerges, market valuations that currently are at a premium may revert to historical averages.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Capital markets in the region should be enablers of capital raising. We have witnessed a vibrant and robust debt issuances especially Sukuks in 2020 in response to increasing deficits. However, we cannot say the same for equity issuances.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, with easy monetary policies unlikely to be reversed anytime soon and asset price inflation being the order of the day, it may be worthwhile to stem the spate of delisting and steer efforts towards increasing the supply of equity stock in the GCC region.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Spate of delisting</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Recently, Investcorp Holdings that manages more than US$35 billion volunteered to delist from Bahrain bourse in response to low trading volumes. Similarly, in Dubai Financial Market firms including Emaar Malls and DXB entertainment that operates theme parks and resorts wanted to go private. Earlier in Nasdaq Dubai, DP World went private and Emirate REIT was considering delisting from Nasdaq Dubai. Apparently, the operational costs of being listed, and its associated disclosure and transparency requirements are being commensurate enough with the advantages of being listed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, for an emerging region such as the GCC, which has huge infrastructural investment needs a buoyant and active capital market is critical where Islamic financing can play a key role. Active capital markets would be prime institution that could cost effectively allocate savings into investments as seen by sovereign Sukuk issuances even with poor credit rating like that of Oman. The current spate of delisting moves needs to be arrested and investor confidence revived. To this end, the lopsided structure of the current equity market that is dominated by banking companies needs to be tackled. Large private companies, state owned enterprises and new age start-ups could be encouraged to list to expand the market breadth.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Governments could take lead and divest stakes at prime valuations</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Disruption caused by COVID-19 led to a slump in new equity issuances (IPOs) in the GCC region. In 2020, the GCC region witnessed only seven IPOs that in aggregate raised US$1,776 million as against twelve issues that in aggregate raised US$33,033 million, a year earlier (EY Mena IPO Eye). With most GCC markets trading at high valuation multiples, governments could take the lead by selling their stakes in key state holding companies. In addition to raising capital to boost the state coffers, the move could provide an impetus to acceleration of privatization programs. Consequently, privatization of state assets could enhance thrust on value enhancement to the benefit of all stakeholders. GCC governments will be well advised to factor Islamic debt issuances as well in order to achieve capital structure balance for large PPP projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>New age companies could evince investors’ interest</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Shares in public entities belong primarily to old businesses that are capital intensive and they may not elicit the kind of response as the new-age businesses that are capital light and digitally driven. Every crisis presents an opportunity and the COVID-19 shakeout could propel certain start-ups/businesses to the forefront. Venture capital and private equity firms that hitherto had catered to the capital needs of start-ups in the region could make use of the current environment to take them public.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For long, despite being included in MSCI Emerging Market (EM) Index, the regional markets have remained under weight in investor’s portfolio. GCC countries in aggregate account for approximately five percent of weight in the MSCI EM index. However, this is quite low in comparison to that of countries such as China (37%), Taiwan (13.8%), South Korea (13.1%) and India (10.0%) (Weights based on iShares Emerging Market ETF). With the emergence of ESG investing, the energy sector is seeing diminished interest from global fund managers with the EM index allocating only 5.3% to the sector while the tech sector leads with 36%. In the context of GCC, Islamic products can be a superior substitute for ESG as it enjoys longer history of ethical investing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The region has its share of success in technology space. UAE-based Emerging Markets Property Group (EMPG) that operates the digital platforms such as zamee.com, bayut.com, mubawaba.ma, Kaidee, Lamudi and Dubizzle is a unicorn (worth over a billion USD). International players had earlier acquired the region’s successful start-ups such as Talabat, Careem and Souq. Addressing the poor representation of GCC companies in the listed technology space could enthuse new vigour in the regional capital markets including Islamic market.</p>[:]]]></Content>

		<Title>[:en]Economic recovery post COVID-19: How they stack up for GCC economies?[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">GCC economies were hit hard by the pandemic last year with the cumulative GDP of the region falling by 5% in 2020 over that of 2019. However, the IMF estimates all the GCC economies to show positive growth in 2021 with Saudi Arabia expected to grow 2.9%, UAE by 3.1%, Qatar by 2.4%, Kuwait by 0.7%, Oman</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>GDP Growth in % from 2020-2022</strong>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GDP-Growth-in-from-2020-2022-MMR-Article.jpg" alt="ETFs domiciled within GCC region" width="800" height="762" />
<span style="color: #696969; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;">Source: IMF 2021 MECA Regional Outlook</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Macro indicators have improved in the GCC</strong>
The improved projections are on back of a rebound in oil prices, strong Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) readings and rapid vaccine rollouts in most countries that will help domestic activity move back towards normality. Saudi Arabia’s Composite PMI has been above 50, the level that indicates expansion, for every month since July 2020. Similarly, UAE’s PMI has been above 50 for every month since Dec 2020. According to Moody’s, the Real GDP of Saudi Arabia is expected to reach pre-pandemic levels (Q4-2019) by Q1-2022, UAE by Q2-2022, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain by Q3-2022 and Kuwait the last to reach by Q3-2023.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Sovereign bond issuances have been on the rise</strong>
In 2020, reduced oil revenues had increased the fiscal deficit of all GCC nations which led to a slew of sovereign bond issuances. Sovereign issuances by GCC entities amounted to USD 66.3 billion in 2020, up 25% year-on-year from the USD 52.9 billion raised during 2019. Sovereign issuances this year have seen good interest from investors, with GCC members with poor credit ratings like Oman raising USD 3.2 billion in January and USD 1.75 billion in June. Better borrowing capacity gives room for more government spending on infrastructure development which can create jobs and boost growth.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Emergence of e-commerce industry</strong>
A positive story to emerge from the crisis which is likely to have lasting effects is the growth of the e-commerce industry in the region. According to Go-Gulf, a web development company in the UAE, e-commerce profits reached USD 20 billion in the GCC up 214% from 2019 and from USD 5 billion in 2015. Go-Gulf projects the e-commerce market for the entire MENA region to expand even beyond the pandemic and generate USD 48.6 billion in sales by the year 2022.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Conclusion</strong>
GCC economies are also in a good position to capitalize on the surge in travel demand when the rest of the world opens up. Events such as Expo 2020 in Dubai and the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, easing of regional tensions and spending by the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) will also support growth. The hard-hit tourism and real estate industries in the region are expected to benefit from the reopening though the threat of new virus variants causing a surge in infections remains.</p>

		<Title>[:en]MSCI Emerging Markets Index – How is the GCC placed?[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">With a total market capitalization of USD 8.3 trillion, the MSCI Emerging Markets (EM) Index has emerged as one of the most important global indices tracked by many ETFs and mutual funds. Inclusion in the index has become sought after not only due to the potential inflows from overseas funds, but also the credibility it gives to the included country’s capital markets.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Weightage of GCC nations in the MSCI EM index is quite low</strong>
Among the GCC, companies from UAE and Qatar were included in the index in 2014 while Saudi and Kuwaiti companies were included in 2019 and 2020. Saudi Arabia enjoys the highest weightage in the index at 2.8% with 36 companies, followed by Qatar at 0.67% with 12 companies, UAE at 0.59% with 9 companies and Kuwait at 0.52% with 6 companies respectively. However, the weightage allotted to the GCC is quite low in comparison to that of countries like China (35%), Taiwan (13.2%), South Korea (13.1%) and India (10.2%).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Weights of GCC nations in MSCI EM Index</strong>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Weights-of-GCC-nations-in-MSCI-EM-Index-MMR-Article-Fig1.jpg" alt="ETFs domiciled within GCC region" width="800" height="762" />
<span style="color: #696969; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;">Note: Weights based on iShares MSCI EM ETF</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Banking Sector dominates GCC representation in the MSCI EM index</strong>
At the company level, the GCC constituents with the most weightage is in the banking sector. Saudi Arabia’s Al-Rajhi Bank ranks highest with a weightage at 0.42%, followed by Saudi National Bank (erstwhile NCB) at 0.39%. Meanwhile, Saudi Aramco, one of the largest companies in the world with market cap of USD 1.9 trillion, has a relatively low weightage of 0.23%. An important reason could be the comparatively low free-float market cap of Aramco of USD 124 billion and fewer number of shares being available for trading on the exchanges.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Energy Sector has low weightage in the MSCI EM index</strong>
Other reasons for low representation of GCC companies particularly in the Energy sector is that many of them are majority owned by the governments and as in the case of Aramco, a major source of revenue for the government which may not always be in the best interest of minority shareholders like international funds.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Also, with the emergence of ESG investing, the Energy sector is itself seeing diminished interest from global fund managers with the EMSCI EM index allocating only 5.3% to the sector while the tech sector leads with 36%. Poor representation of GCC companies in the tech sector is another reason for the GCC lagging behind other emerging markets in the MSCI EM index.</p>

		<Title>[:en]COVID-19 accelerates Saudi Arabia’s push towards cashless society[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Event</strong>
Youth between the ages 16 and 22 in Saudi Arabia are using less cash compared to other age groups, indicating that the country’s transition towards a cashless society is on track.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Analysis</strong>
Saudi Arabia set a goal of gradually transforming into a cashless society by increasing the number of non-cash transactions to 70% by 2025 as part of its Saudi Vision 2030. Saudi Arabia has been taking huge strides in this regard during recent years, supported by the Government and the Central Bank. Initiatives such as mandating employers to assign employee wages directly to their bank, migrating payments during the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages towards cashless forms, SAMA’s introduction of its own Saudi payments infrastructure in 2018, establishment of a regulatory sandbox for upcoming Fintech companies have led to substantial improvement in moving towards cashless modes of payment. The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has further accelerated the rate of adoption of digital payments in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">POS (Point of Sales) to ATM (Automated Teller Machine) transaction value ratio, a popular indicator to gauge the adoption of cashless forms of payments, has increased from 35% in Q1 2019 to 80% in Q2 2021. Although the huge leap could be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, the levels are not expected to drop significantly as the cashless habits are likely to remain even after the pandemic. Another notable change has been the use of NFC (Near Field Communication) technology in POS transactions through mobile phones and plastic cards. In simpler terms, it means the usage of Tap-to-pay technology. The share of NFC transactions in total POS transactions has surged from 19% in Q1 2019 to 91% in Q2 2021. The ongoing social distancing norms, banks making the NFC technology available to more customers and mobile manufacturers enabling the technology in latest models have all contributed to the rise in use of Tap-to-pay technology in the country.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, a survey published by Fintech Saudi indicated that the majority of population still use cash once a week but the overall cash usage of the Saudi population is on the decline. Despite the decrease in cash transactions, 56% of individuals still use cash once a week and 26% still use cash every day. The survey also inferred that there is a strong correlation between age and use of cash every day. Only 18% of 16-22 year olds use cash every day, which increases to 46% for individuals who are 60 years and above. The above indicators suggest a widespread acceptance of cashless forms of payments while there is a simultaneous prevalence in the usage of cash. While the complete transition towards a cashless society would require time, Saudi Arabia is certainly on track to achieve its goals in this regard.</p>

		<Title>[:en]Following a year of distress, Saudi Arabia economy back on growth path[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">Saudi Arabia economic growth as evidenced by its real GDP grew by 1.5% in Q2 2021 as compared with the same period last year, registering its first quarterly economic expansion since the start of COVID-19 pandemic early last year. Economic growth in Saudi Arabia was led by 10% increase in the non-oil sector (Q2, 2021 yoy basis), according to data from the General Authority for Statistics. While the government sector saw 0.7% growth, the oil sector recorded a decline of 7%. On a sequential basis, GDP expanded by 1.1% (Q2 2021 vs Q1 2021). This was led by the oil sector which grew 2.5% and the non-oil sector adding 1.3%. The government sector contracted by 2.6% in Q2 compared to Q1.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The annual growth, particularly for real non-oil GDP, reflects the low base from last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The quarterly GDP growth in Q2 2021 points to a pick-up in activity, with the oil sector benefiting from higher production. The oil sector is expected to further benefit in the coming months after OPEC and its allies, referred to as OPEC+, agreed to restore production to pre-pandemic levels gradually starting from this month.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">With economic momentum expected to further pick up pace over the second half of this year, economists have upgraded their growth forecasts for Saudi Arabia. The London-based consultancy Capital Economics has pencilled in GDP growth of 4.8% this year and 6.3% in 2022. This is much stronger than forecasts made by other agencies. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects Saudi Arabia's economy to grow by 2.4% this year, after the KSA economy contracted 4.1% in 2020 due to the twin shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic and lower oil prices. Fitch ratings which raised Saudi Arabia’s outlook last month, expects Saudi Arabia GDP growth to average 3% from 2021-2023.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Saudi Arabia is trying to boost its non-oil sector through a multi trillion-dollar spending push that will require state companies to cut dividends they pay the government to boost capital spending. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, architect of the Saudi Vision 2030 programme, has said the state-backed Public Investment Fund (PIF) will pump at least 150 billion riyals (USD 40 billion) into the local economy each year through 2025 by divesting some of the many investments it has made around the world.</p>

		<Title>[:en]Saudi Arabia eases regulation to support SMEs and Entrepreneurs[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">Saudi Arabia will exempt small and medium enterprises (SMEs) from commerce fees register for three years as the country plans to boost the number of start-ups in the economy. Fees will start in the fourth and fifth year, but at a reduced rate of SAR 500 (USD 133) for entrepreneurs and SAR 200 for entrepreneurs with a capital of less than SAR 375,000 and whose employees do not exceed five in number. This initiative was taken to support and reduce the start-up costs for entrepreneurs and SMEs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Saudi Arabia has given significant support to SMEs since the onset of the pandemic</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Saudi Arabia extended a loan deferral program to help SMEs cope with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic by three months to the end of September. The program has allowed SMEs to defer SAR 167 billion (USD 45 billion) in payments since the pandemic began in March 2020. The program has since been extended several times to help support economic growth and employment in the private sector, and to maintain financial sector stability.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Additionally, Saudi Arabia’s Social Development Bank allocated SAR 9 billion (USD 2.4 billion) as aid to SMEs. The funds will be used to help 6,000 businesses with financing and a newly created portfolio will focus on companies in the healthcare sector. The Saudi Industrial Development Fund said it provided USD 4.5 billion in support last year, mostly to small businesses, as Saudi Arabia looked to prop up firms hit by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These support measures are part of an effort to increase the contribution of SMEs to the economy. Contribution of SMEs to the GDP has surged 45% since Vision 2030 was launched five years ago, according to official figures. During the period from 2016 until 2018, the SMEs’ contribution to the GDP increased from 20% to 29%.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Saudi Arabia has a goal to raise the contribution to 35% of GDP by 2030. Furthermore, the number of SMEs under the Vision 2030 grew from 447,000 five years ago to 614,000 in 2020. In addition, the SMEs’ share of bank loans rose from 2% to 8% in the 2016-2018 period, compared to a target of 11% by 2025. Besides the government has started accelerator programs like Taqqadam in collaboration with universities to encourage entrepreneurship, startups and SMEs. This multi-pronged approach of loans and targeted aid to SMEs can help SMEs recover from the impact of COVID-19 and adapt to the changing situation as the world emerges out of the pandemic.</p>

		<Title>[:en]Kuwait Luxury Retail – Evolving amid COVID-19[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">Kuwait boasts the presence of several major luxury brands such as Prada, Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Chaumet, Bottega Veneta etc. Ranking 13th in the world in terms of per capita GDP, its affluent and brand conscious population, young demography, and a growing population position Kuwait’s luxury retail market favorably. A dedicated luxury retail district in The Avenues, the largest mall in Kuwait, homegrown luxury brands like K7L and e-commerce players such as Chic Kuwait further highlight the uptake of luxury retail in Kuwait.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The luxury retail sector in Kuwait has not escaped COVID-19 unscathed. Luxury and franchise-based retailers such as Alshaya had seen sales decrease by 95% overnight. While possibility of subsequent waves of COVID-19 and measures such as vaccinated individuals only being allowed in the malls continue to affect the sector, vaccination of 70% of Kuwait’s population offers cause for optimism for the luxury industry in Kuwait for 2021 and beyond. Consumer spending is also expected to improve 4.1% y/y in 2021, after the contraction faced in 2020.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">COVID-19 has emphasized the advantage of an omni-channel retail model. Trafalgar, a luxury retailer founded in Kuwait in 1972, has launched its online shop named ‘Its Luxury’ in June 2020. The touch and feel aspect of instore shopping and the experience in itself, would sustain the brick and mortar stores in luxury retail as indicated by a recent survey on luxury retail in Kuwait, wherein 65% of the respondents preferred to shop instore for luxury items.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Additional trends that are likely to leave a mark are sustainability and quiet luxury that is understated and aesthetic. For example, Stella McCartney, a socially-responsible label that focuses on sustainability has recently set shop in Kuwait. The broad umbrella of segments that luxury retail could operate offers additional opportunities. In the backdrop of greater importance being placed on health, globally, high-end fitness equipment is reportedly gaining popularity.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While recovery in the sector could be slow, COVID-19 is bound to leave a mark on luxury retail through increase in online shopping and quicker adoption of tech trends such as personalized recommendations/smart trial rooms. Customer focus is likely to be on products’ value add and on owning fewer but better products. Given the basic buyer propensity in Kuwait to high-value goods, luxury retail would continue to thrive.</p>

		<Title>[:en]Foreign investment in Saudi stock market up by 150%[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">It is reported that the foreign investment in the Kingdom's stock market increased by more than 150 percent by the end of Q2 2021, compared to late 2018. Banking, basic materials, energy and communications attracted the most foreign investment. This can be attributed to the Saudi Arabia’s efforts to develop the financial market and expand the institutional investment base. The value of foreign investment in Saudi Stock Market was USD 73.6 billion in 2021Q2 comprising mainly of Qualified Foreign Investors (QFI) investment of USD 57.7 billion, Strategic Partners of USD 13.3 billion, foreign residents of USD 2.1 billion, SWAP Holders of USD 0.6 billion and negligible amount (USD 5 million) from foreign Discretionary Portfolios under Management (DPMs).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The government of Saudi Arabia decided to open its stock markets to foreign investors some years back in 2015. The government of Saudi Arabia took this action to deal with two major issues in relation to their national stock exchange. The hope that in allowing more participants, it will assist in reducing the excessive volatility that exists in the market. Also, to help with better corporate financial policies of companies that are traded in the exchange. Several mostly family owned businesses were short on transparency and the best business practices. An additional benefit to Saudi Arabia, was the infusion of the equivalent of billions of foreign investment to the domestic economy as part of the larger goals of Vision 2030 to strengthen resources for domestic investment opportunities in the Kingdom and free it from the impacts of oil price volatility.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Capital Market Authority through The Financial Sector Development Program, has made measures to raise the attractiveness of the Saudi financial market and enhance the entry of foreign investors directly or indirectly, starting by allowing foreign resident investors to invest in the Saudi stock market directly, allowing foreign investors to enter the Saudi stock market through swap agreements, allowing qualified foreign investors to invest in listed securities, allowing foreign strategic investors to own strategic stakes in listed companies, and allowing foreign investors to directly invest in debt instruments.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As per the relaxed norms The Saudi Stock Exchange, or Tadawul, permits established institutional foreign investors, not individual investors (except in the Parallel or Nomu market), to trade. A qualified foreign investor, for the purposes of the Saudi exchange, has at least $5 billion in assets under management and has been in business for at least five years. Investors who aren't billionaires can invest more modest amounts in Saudi Arabia through any of a handful of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that focus on the region. Saudi Stock Exchange is included in MSCI Index (2.59% weight), FTSE Russell (3.76% weight) and S & P Index (2.83% weight) since 2018.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In addition to restrictions on individual investors , there continues to be other limits to direct investment in Saudi companies such as (a) A foreign investor may own no more than 5% of the shares issued in any one company(b) All foreign investors (resident or non-resident) may collectively own no more than 49% percent of any company's shares and (c) All qualified foreign investors collectively are limited to 20% of a single company's shares and 10% of all of the shares of all of the companies listed on the exchange.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It therefore remains to be seen whether the authorities will introduce more relaxations to enable the Saudi Stock Market to become a true international market that can attract global flows in a big way.</p>

		<Title>[:en]Kuwaiti banks – Earnings report Q2’2021[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">All major Kuwaiti banks reported their financial results for the second quarter of 2021. The Kuwait banking sector reported a healthy growth in net income after taxes for Q2’21 compared to that of Q2’20, mainly due to the reduction in provisions and impairment charges for bad loans that were recorded in the prior quarters due to higher expected credit losses.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Due to historically low interest rates and increased provision for bad debts, profitability of the Kuwait banking sector was impacted negatively, with a 52.8% drop in net profits in 2020. All the banks reported a staggering positive growth with some of them witnessing a 2x increase in earnings in Q2’21 as compared to Q2’20. The banking sector, with a few exceptions, also marked a healthy quarter on quarter growth.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In 2020, a year where the impact of COVID-19 on business was relatively magnified, Kuwait banks in expectations of high credit losses, increased their provisions for bad loans. Not only did these provisions decrease in 2021, with economic recovery, but the banking sector witnessed a growth in operating revenue, operating income and investment income which helped in translating to higher net income.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Kuwait has recently eased on the restrictions with removal of its curfew, resulting in businesses and economy reviving and hitting normalcy again. The Governor of the Kuwait Central Bank cautioned against withdrawing stimulus measures too abruptly as this could lead to borrower’s defaults and hinderance to growth in the short-term. With monetary stimulus in place and businesses recovering, the banking sector could see a further growth in operating revenue in the coming quarters.</p>

		<Title><![CDATA[[:en]Oil revenues & private sector growth to speed up GCC economic recovery in 2022[:]]]></Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">As the world charts its recovery from COVID-19’s impact, businesses and trade around the world begin to hit normalcy, reviving the global demand for oil and consequently the global oil prices. As of August’21, price of IPE Brent is up nearly 41% year to date. OPEC+ is firm on its stance of cutting oil production until mid-2022, this is set to support global oil prices and provide renewed vigour for GCC economies. According to Institute of International Finance (IIF), the hydrocarbon real GDP growth rate in 2022 is expected to touch 5% with hydrocarbon revenue within the GCC region increasing from $221 bn to $326 bn in 2021.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In 2020, as Oil prices hit multi-year lows, the governments of the GCC countries stepped up on the diversification path via the private sector with special emphasis on the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The policy rates are deemed to remain accommodative, in a bid to enhance credit to the private sector, to enable full economic rebound. (<strong><a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/saudi-arabia-eases-regulation-to-support-smes-and-entrepreneurs/">Saudi Arabia eases regulation to support SMEs and Entrepreneurs</a></strong>)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The GCC governments have made investor friendly transformations in the legal and regulatory framework governing foreign investments. In a bid to increase the ease of doing business, UAE has allowed full foreign ownership of the onshore companies without the need for an Emirati shareholder or agent. Kingdom of Saudi Arabia issued record number of foreign investor licenses in Q1 of 2021, marking a 36.2% annual increase, with foreign investment in Saudi stock market up by 150% in Q2’21 as compared to 2018. Saudi Arabia is also witnessing a healthy growth in start-up funding, jumping from $8mn in 2016 to $150mn in 2020. (<strong>Foreign investment in Saudi stock market up by 150%</strong>)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The non-oil real GDP growth rate for GCC countries in 2021, with Oman as an exception, is estimated to touch 3% as per the World Economic Outlook report of the IMF. Despite positive outlook for both oil price and private sector, the risk of slow vaccination rollout, delta variant and new restrictions by the states in response to it, looms large on the GCC recovery.</p>

		<Title>[:en]Could Delta variant play spoilsport for Oil prices?[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">The Delta variant, which the WHO has called the most transmissible variant of the coronavirus, has caused a surge in covid-19 cases around the world. With a rise in cases, comes a rise in restrictions by the governments to curb the transmission. Travel restrictions in different parts of the world, is set to exert downward pressure on the global jet fuel demand.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">During the week ending 20th August, Brent crude oil price witnessed its biggest weekly loss this year of 8%, falling to $65.18 bbl, its lowest since April’21. This originates from investor fears over weakening global oil demand in the wake of various travel restrictions, which can potentially put the global economic recovery under pressure.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Among the nations that have put restrictions in place, the world’s largest importer of crude oil, China has imposed fresh restrictions and regulations including stricter disinfection at ports, which is not just causing congestion and down-time at the ports but also having an impact on global supply chain, especially in Asia, which is a key demand centre for oil. This uncertainty puts a cap on not just the oil prices but also prices of various other commodities. With the oil demand under pressure, the global oil supply is also steadily increasing, which puts all the more pressure on the oil price.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Despite the weak demand outlook for Asia, other parts of the world continue to open-up, with restrictions being eased on the back of efficient vaccine rollouts. U.S. Department of Transportation reported vehicles’ miles travelled on highways in the week of 1st August’21 are similar to the metrics of 2019.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On the supply side, Hurricane Ida swept the U.S. state of Louisiana, temporarily shutting down the refining operations and oil production in the Gulf of Mexico, and putting a constraint on supply, which resulted in driving up the oil prices. OPEC+ in the latest meeting on 1st September maintained its status quo of gradual oil output increase despite the pressure from the White House.</p>

		<Title>[:en]OPEC+ September 2021 meet: Maintaining Status Quo[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">Since the last OPEC+ meeting, conducted on July 18th, the global oil market has witnessed some significant events. There has been a surge in covid cases due to the new delta variant, causing government restrictions in key demand centers of the world, subsequently putting pressure on the global oil demand and prices. In the week ending 20th August, oil brent price witnessed its worst weekly drop of 8% landing at $65.18 bbl, its lowest since April’21.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On the supply end of the spectrum, OPEC+ noted the increasing global supply and the revised forecast for production which is adjusted upward for non-OPEC liquids production, US liquids production and the US liquids supply for 2021. However, the meeting also noted that hurricane IDA temporarily disrupted supply in the Gulf of Mexico, leading to a rebound in the oil prices, and is closely monitoring the situation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The meeting noted that the market fundamentals for growth have strengthened but also acknowledged the uncertainty that looms large due to rising cases of covid around the world. But optimism remains strong with positive signs of the robust vaccination plans around the world, with third wave beginning to stabilize in Africa and China succeeding in bringing its number of new locally transmitted cases to zero, as noted by the Secretary General, Mr. Mohammed Barkindo, in his address.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Keeping the above externalities in consideration, the OPEC+ in their latest meeting on 1st September decided to reaffirm its decision, taken in their last meeting, to adjust upward the monthly overall production by 0.4 mbpd. This comes despite adjusting its 2022 oil demand outlook upwards and the pressure from the White House to increase supply in order to meet the growing global oil demand. IPE Brent fell 1.9% the next day, closing at 71.6 $/bbl. The group also decided to extend the compensation period until the end of December 2021 as requested by some countries and requested those countries submit their compensation plans by 17 September 2021. The next meet, 21st OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting, is scheduled for 4th October 2021.</p>[:]]]></Content>

		<Title><![CDATA[[:en]Profits at UAE's major lenders reached USD 4 billion in H1 2021[:]]]></Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">Profits at the four largest UAE banks rose during the first half of 2021 after an improvement in the operating environment led to lower loan-loss provisions, rise in non-interest income and improvement in operating efficiency.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The combined net profit of four major banks, First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB), Emirates NBD (ENBD), Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), and Dubai Islamic Bank (DIB) reached USD 4 billion in H1 2021, up 17% from the same period last year. The four big banks dominate UAE banking accounting for 77% the country’s banking assets.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Rise in non-interest income makes up for lower interest rates</strong>
Lower interest rates pushed down net interest income. Net interest income for the four banks fell by 12% for the six months as lower interest rates drove a fall in asset yields. The decline was slightly offset by lower interest expenses as banks retired expensive deposits in an effort to reduce funding costs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Non-interest income surged. Income from investment securities, fee-based activities and market trading rose 17% year-on-year as economic activity in the UAE picked up and one-off fee waivers granted last year ended.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Operating efficiency improved further. The four banks focused on cost-efficiency and managed to reduce operating expenses for the period by 6% year-on-year when excluding the cost of integrating acquisitions, supporting their bottom-line profitability.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Easing loan loss provisions</strong>
Loan-loss provisions eased as bank provisioning fell by 38% in the first half of 2021, as the UAE economy recovered with GDP growth expected to reach 3.1% in 2021 as against 5.9% de-growth in 2020. While the full impact of the pandemic on banks' asset quality will not be clear until the central bank's Targeted Economic Support Scheme (TESS) is withdrawn, combined non-performing loans of the four banks have increased slightly to 6.2% as of June 2021 from 5.2% as of June 2020. At the same time, coverage moderately declined to still solid levels of 83%.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Profitability as measured by return on assets will remain below pre-pandemic levels this year. The aggregate return on assets of the four banks was 1.2% for H1 2021, up 10 basis points year-on-year, but lower than the 1.7% they achieved in 2019. Lower interest income, combined with precautionary provisioning will keep net profit below pre-pandemic levels over the coming quarters.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Capital buffers remain adequate. The banks have maintained Basel III Tier 1 capital at 15.9% of risk-weighted assets (RWAs) in aggregate. The sound capital adequacy ratios are the result of lower dividend payouts and muted growth in risk-weighted assets.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Share Price Performance</strong>
The improving profitability has been reflected in the rebound of the banks’ share prices this year with FAB surging by 34% for the year-till-date as of September 6, 2021 (YTD). Emirates NBD is up 34.9% YTD while Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank and Dubai Islamic Bank are up 22.9% and 10.4% YTD respectively.</p>

		<Title>[:en]Filling the gap in ESG framework: Saudi Arabia[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund has asked banks to help it develop an environmental, social and governance (ESG) framework, as per a recent article in Reuters. According to the article, development of ESG framework was likely a precursor for a multibillion dollar bond sale, which would be the Saudi wealth fund's first.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">ESG has been one of the hottest topics in the world of finance. There is ample demand from investors for ESG compliant instruments but due to lack of expertise and uniform reporting norms, companies and institutions are at their own free will with respect to their ESG disclosures. There seems to be a gap in standardising ESG reporting framework which governments and financial reporting boards across the world aim to fill.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Earlier this year, the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation announced its plans to develop a single, global ESG framework. Mirroring these global trends, in the MENA region, Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund has asked banks to help in the development of an ESG framework. The government of Oman had also recently announced its plans to develop an ESG framework.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been keen in implementing ESG related programmes. Few initiatives taken in the recent past include the following:</p>

<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul class="rdetails_list">
 	<li>In August 2020, the Saudi exchange announced its plans to launch an ESG index along with MSCI by end of 2021 or Q1 2021.</li>
 	<li>Saudi stock exchange and the Future Investment Initiative Institute signed a MoU to spread ESG awareness in the country, earlier this year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">ESG integration in Saudi Arabia remains at a nascent stage. The country, which is one of the largest producers of oil worldwide, plans to become carbon neutral and aims to generate 50% of its electricity from renewables by 2030. This initiative, being a crucial step towards long-term sustainable development, goes with other “green turns” in the region’s economy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In October 2020, a top performing emerging market bond fund avoided investments in Saudi Arabia as it scored low in the fund’s ESG ratings. On the other hand Saudi Arabia enjoyed the benefits from ESG-conscious investors when Saudi Electricity’s green sukuk issuance was oversubscribed five times. These reflect that ESG can no longer be ignored and companies/institutions must embrace it to avoid constrained growth and increased scrutiny.</p>[:]]]></Content>

		<Title>[:en]Changing consumer habits amid COVID-19 accelerates decline of Saudi Arabia bank branches[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">Bank branches operating in Saudi Arabia have reduced by 4.6% y/y in Q2 2021 to 1,969 branches (SAMA). The number of branches had been on a year-on-year declining trend since Q3 2020, with the current quarter posting the highest decline. The number of ATMs has also decreased by 9% y/y in Q2 2021. Operational considerations and uptake of digital banking, accelerated by COVID-19, seem to have contributed to the trend.
<strong>Total Bank Branches in Saudi Arabia</strong>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Total-Bank-Branches-in-Saudi-Arabia.jpg" alt="Total Bank Branches in Saudi Arabia" width="800" height="762" />
<span style="color: #696969; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;">Source: SAMA</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">According to SAMA’s bulletin, Saudi British Bank (SABB) branches had seen the most year-on-year reduction at 18.9% y/y as of Q2 2021, followed by Riyad Bank at 17.5% in Q2 2021. In terms of number of branches, Riyad Bank has closed 54 branches while SABB has closed 23 branches. The merger of SABB with Alawwal Bank was carried out in June 2019. Co-location of staff of the two banks is likely to have contributed to closure of SABB branches. As a strategy, the bank aims to minimize office footprint and costs of the combined branches. Digital Account Opening and online KYC are some features provided by the bank to migrate transactions from branch banking to digital medium. Riyad Bank also offers features such as digital account opening and online application for personal finance etc. Closure of branches amid the digital shift could also help banks ease cost pressures.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In terms of regions, Eastern Province, Makkah and Riyadh accounted for 87% of the bank closures. 29 branches were closed in Riyadh and 27 branches each in Eastern Province and Makkah were closed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, contrary to the broader trend, Saudi National Bank, the merged entity National Commercial Bank and Samba Financial Group has seen a 16.7% increase in branches, following the merger in April 2021. The bank plans to relocate 21 branches that are in proximity to each other and also plans to add 9 branches by the year end.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Credit growth has remained healthy with banks’ claims on private sector increasing by 15.7% y/y and consumer loans increasing by 17.4% y/y. Digital banking avenues have witnessed significant growth due to COVID-19 driven change in consumer habits. Value of point-of-sale transactions and e-commerce transactions by MADA cards have increased by 54% and 64% y/y respectively. Value of transactions in online bill payment system (SADAD) and interbank payment and settlement system (SARIE) have increased by 128% and 23% y/y respectively in Q2 2021. Saudi Arabia has also launched an instant payments system in April 2021, which recorded transactions worth SAR 69.6 bn. Usage of banking apps also seem to be rising. Finance app downloads in Saudi Arabia led by payments, banking and investment apps have increased by 73% y/y in Q1 2021.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Decline in number of branches, rise in adoption of digital avenues for banking, SAMA’s approval of digital banking license to STC Pay and real estate firm Abdulrahman Saad Al Rashid & Son seem to indicate the increase in pace of digitalization in Saudi banking sector.</p>

		<Title>[:en]Economic Impact of Dubai Expo 2020[:ar]Economic Impact of Dubai Expo 2020[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]Dubai Expo 2020 will have an impact on the economy through the infrastructure valued at more than USD 12 billion (versus USD 7.5 billion estimate in 2013) that is being spent to successfully build Expo 2020’s establishment. The event was postponed by a year to October 2021 in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Dubai Expo 2020 will be the first world expo to be held in the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia region. Expo 2020 will leverage the power of World Expos and the UAE’s unique position as a global focal point to bring together 191 countries and millions of visitors. One of the first events of this scale to take place since the start of the pandemic, the six-month experience brings together businesses of all sizes, international organizations and government entities from across the world, to come together to foster a more diversified and resilient global economy, inspire a vibrant business environment and drive sustainable growth. Expo 2020 is set to showcase Dubai's characteristic appeal for foreign investment, predominantly due to the pro-business government, independent financial regulator, global financial exchange, high number of HNWIs, dynamic business community, world-class telecommunications and infrastructure, the fact English is widely spoken, as well as the desirable geographical location and time zone.

The site for the venue of Dubai Expo 2020 is a 438-hectare plot strategically located between the two major emirates of the UAE, Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and next to the new Al Maktoum International Airport in Jebel Ali. The site will house the expo headquarters and is estimated to include 700,000 square meters of pavilions and other venue space, and 500,000 square meters of permanent structures. The host site is being provided with new roads, metro extension, buildings, hotels and facilities to accommodate tourists. The organizers of the EXPO 2020 event opened the Thematic Pavilion inclusive of public places (dining area, gift shop & play area) before its official date in October 2021 while the Sustainability Pavilion which focuses on addressing the immediate environmental issues is also to be opened soon. In line with EXPO 2020 vision to become one of the most sustainable World EXPO in history, UAE is focusing its efforts to Champion the Green development, which will be on preview at the Sustainability Pavilion with the objective of finding solutions to most pressing challenges such as climate change, education, digitalization and healthcare.

It was expected that 25 million visitors will be attending the Expo 2020 though the actual numbers taking into impact of the pandemic needs to be seen.  Out of the total visitors more than 17 million individuals were expected to be global travelers. With the immunizations, mass testing, adjusted social practices and its proposed A.I-assisted queue and crowd controls and roving paramedics, there is confidence that the event will be managed well. Dubai has been open for tourists since July 2020 and has managed to control the epidemic amid a highly effective vaccination campaign. Vaccination rates are among the highest globally: over 18 million doses have been administered to a population of 10 million. From October 2020, the Emirate opened to host multiple global conferences and sports events though at a smaller scale compared to the Expo and have other major events on the horizon like the Indian T20 IPL championship matches (mid-September 2021), T20 Cricket World Cup (mid -October) and Formula 1 (December 3rd -5th).

Dubai Expo 2020 is expected to include a significant contribution to the non-oil-based economy of Dubai and the wider UAE. Although the precise impact of Dubai Expo 2020 is difficult to predict, there is little doubt it is an event of significant importance to the UAE economy. According to analysts, the run up to Dubai Expo 2020 is likely to generate approximately US$23 billion in GDP. The construction and real estate sectors, were faced with a softened impact of the pandemic in H1 2020, possibly benefitted from the expansion in Dubai's hotel capacity that is required to accommodate the 25 million expected visitors. The hospitality sector that was hit by the pandemic can expect to witness recovery once the Expo commences. The residential real estate sales in Dubai improved significantly in H1 2021 possibly aided by the feel good factor.  

From more tourism to more retail to more transportation, the economic activity of Dubai is expected to get impacted positively by the event, thus resulting in the overall economic development and rebound from Covid-19 impact. MEED reports, anticipated 277,000 jobs opening in the making of Expo 2020, of which, 40% are in the tourism, travel and leisure sector. The construction sector accounts for the rest of the job percentage. From celebrity involvement to investments and advertisements, Expo 2020 is expected to have great involvement in boosting Dubai’s economy. International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that UAE GDP (Gross Domestic Product) at constant prices will see an overall growth of 3.1% in 2021 and 2.6% during the year 2022. Thus, the UAE economy is expected to recover this year and the economic activity will gradually pick up especially during the second half of the year when the EXPO 2020 event will be held.[:ar]Dubai Expo 2020 will have an impact on the economy through the infrastructure valued at more than USD 12 billion (versus USD 7.5 billion estimate in 2013) that is being spent to successfully build Expo 2020’s establishment.

		<Title>[:en]Private sector participation in Saudi Healthcare picks up pace[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">Saudi Arabia has recently undertaken initiatives to increase private sector participation in its healthcare sector and improve competency of its healthcare workforce. The country has also highlighted key segments of focus in the healthcare sector.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Saudi Arabia’s growing population with expected increase in average age and rising lifestyle related diseases are indicative of the uptrend in demand for healthcare in the country. As the Saudi Healthcare sector is predominantly operated by Ministry of Health (MoH), the demand could overload public healthcare system and strain government finances. In this context, Saudi Arabia targets to improve contribution of private sector in healthcare from 25% to 35% by 2030. It is planning to attract initial investment of USD 7.3bn into the sector from private investors. Recent key initiatives undertaken by MoH include,</p>

<ul class="rdetails_list" style="text-align: left;">
 	<li>Partnerships with private companies to build and operate hospitals, primary healthcare centers etc. with an initial investment over USD 3.7bn.</li>
 	<li>Plans to set up 74 primary health care centers with initial investments of about USD 266 mn.</li>
 	<li>Two medical cities are planned to be set up with a capacity of 1500 beds in Aseer and Al Jouf, with an initial investment of about USD 1.6 bn.</li>
 	<li>Agreements with international companies to provide dialysis services to 8,000 beneficiaries with a value of USD 2bn over a 5-year period.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">The segments of focus for the healthcare sector as outlined by KSA’s minister of health are e-health, air medical transport, nephrology care, mental health, and rehabilitation. The country has also signed MoUs with AstraZeneca, Pfizer to establish clinical research centres.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Saudi Arabia has low ratios of clinical staff to population levels (Saudi Healthcare Strategy 2017). Additionally, 55% of physicians are expatriates, highlighting the need for skill development among nationals. As part of its workforce development strategy, Saudi Arabia has launched the Makken Healthcare Model Program to develop competency of its healthcare workforce. The program includes partnership with international education institutions. According to the Minister for Health, it passes through 4 stages – the program, readiness of healthcare communities, trainer and the trainees.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Saudi healthcare sector is also seeing interest from private players. Gulf Islamic Investments plans to buy a stake in a Saudi healthcare company for USD 600 mn. Dubai-based Foundation Holdings Company plans to invest USD 67mn in the Saudi primary healthcare sector. It has already acquired a 51% stake in Saudi primary health chain Shifa Al Munthaza Polyclinic accounting for about half of the planned investment.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While Healthcare Transformation strategy was formulated as part of Vision 2030 realization program, boosted by COVID-19, pace of change in Saudi’s healthcare sector appears to be gaining traction with increasing involvement from various stakeholders.</p>

		<Title>[:en]Dubai World 2010 to China Evergrande Group 2021; Looking Beyond Leverage[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">From a bird’s eye view, the Evergrande debt crisis of 2021 and the Dubai world real estate crisis of 2010 would seem very close. In both the debacles, the supply outstripped the demand and leverage, being the double-edged sword, hampered the company finances with timely contractual obligations due in a period marked with high volatility and liquidity crunch. Evergrande group has debt worth USD 88.8 billion in 2021 relative to Dubai World’s debt of roughly USD 59 billion in 2010.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Although when the two situations are looked at from an eagles’ eye, there are key differences that could decide how the crises unfold differently.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The last two decades have seen China become the global manufacturing hub, with an exponential growth in new real estate projects being set up around the country. This exponential growth in China was fueled with leverage, now although the amount of debt in the country is comparable to the American and the European counterparts, it is the growth of leverage in the past decade that concerned the Chinese government last year. The debt to GDP ratio for China has grown more than 110 points, compared to 20-45 points in the US and UK since 2007.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">China in order to curb this growth in leverage came up with the “Three Red Lines” framework for real estate developers, according to which the developer’s financial ratios namely - liabilities to assets ratio, net debt-to-equity ratio and cash-to-short-term-debt ratio, will determine the growth in debt levels for the developer. Even if a developer meets all the ratio thresholds set by the government, the growth in debt levels is capped at 15%, and for those who do not meet any of the thresholds, will not be able to increase their debt above their June 2019 levels. Evergrande Group, unfortunately for its various stakeholders, falls in the latter category.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The rationale for the Chinese Government to target the real estate developers is two-fold, it is not just to curtail the huge leverage inherent in the industry but also to control the real estate sector from over-heating. In July 2020, property sales volumes were up 9.5% year on year with a 7.2% rise in the housing price index in the prior month, touching an 11-month high. The premiums in land auctions were also high at 15%-20%, comparable to the 2019 levels.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This brings a key difference in the two crises, the 2021 Evergrande crisis originates from the Government taking steps to avoid a bubble to the Dubai world real estate crisis where the Dubai World is on the receiving end of a bubble that bust.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the year 2000, Dubai decided to diversify its economy from an oil-reliant state to a tourism hub that we know today. Real estate became one of the biggest contributors to the Dubai economy at 22.6% of GDP with the construction of the tallest skyscraper and elaborate real estate projects. During 2004 to 2006, Dubai benefitted massively from the real estate boom. Dubai World was established in 2006, as an investment company with assets spread around the globe from stakes in Las Vegas casino company MGM Mirage to London-traded bank Standard Chartered Plc and luxury retailer Barneys New York. The same leverage that assisted Dubai to ride the real estate boom, became a major concern during the U.S financial crisis of 2008 with property values declining more than 50% in value from its peak in early 2000s. But, in contrast to Evergrande Group whose projects and properties are spread across China, Dubai Government had invested not only in the local real estate market but had a big stake in real estate markets in United states through a foreign investment arm of Emaar. When the real estate market in U.S bust, its impact was felt by nations around the world, but the correlation for Dubai was relatively greater due to risk exposure to both the sector and the country where the recession erupted.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Upon understanding the differences between pre and post bubble crisis and their differences in risk exposures, the last pillar of difference originates in the mitigation of the crises. The mitigation in any crisis falls down to the ownership structure of the company in consideration. Dubai World is owned 100% by the Government, whereas Evergrande Group is a listed company with its founder and chairman, Ka Yan Hui, holding more than 70% of the company. In the case of Dubai World, Abu Dhabi and Central Bank of UAE bailed out the state-run entity with a 10-billion-dollar payout taking care of both the short-term debt obligations and amount owed to trade creditors and contractors. Upon seeing the Government bailout, the other stakeholders including investors and creditors gained confidence and the company was able to restructure the remaining debt on its books.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The risk premium relative to a government owned entity is almost always higher, and the Evergrande Group underscores that increased risk premium. Evergrande’s cash crunch coupled with no support from the Government, is having the developer in a situation where it is paying bills to contractors and suppliers with unfinished apartments instead of actual money. With long term real estate projects in pipeline, Evergrande presold more than 1.4 million apartments valued at USD 200 billion. Some market participants believe that this is unlikely to cause a systemic risk, since Evergrande’s outstanding debt relative to banking assets in the country is still low but is heavily dependent on Government planned intervention. Other market participants believe that Beijing will let Evergrande fail and inflict losses on its shareholders and bondholders but will find a way to protect the population at large who have paid for the unfinished apartments.</p>[:]]]></Content>

		<Title>[:en]India/UAE Trade: $115 billion Bet[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">There are only few pockets of growth available post-Covid. India and UAE can count themselves among these pockets. Both countries have hitherto restricted their trade and investments to normal levels. However, in recent meetings the trade ministers of both countries have set up ambitious targets to take this engagement to next level. For example, the total trade (meaning exports +Imports) dropped by 30% in 2020 due to Covid and is now placed at $42 billion. The aim is to take this number to $115 billion in the next five years, which implies an annual growth rate of 22%. While this may seem ambitious, both countries should focus on their respective strengths to get there.
What should UAE tap into to achieve this target?</p>

<ul class="rdetails_list" style="text-align: left;">
 	<li>Improve its share of India’s oil imports</li>
 	<li>Growing tourists’ numbers from India (already exceed 1 million)</li>
 	<li>Vast network of successful Indian Businessmen based in UAE &</li>
 	<li>Growing Indian economy that has ambition to be a $5 trillion economy (from the present $3 trillion)</li>
 	<li>The huge 2.75 million Indian diaspora that lives in the Emirates.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">What should India tap into?</p>

<ul class="rdetails_list" style="text-align: left;">
 	<li>Growing UAE economy that is set to double in size in the next 10 years.</li>
 	<li>Attracting FDI from UAE through its huge SWF in several Indian sectors with a technology focus. SWF investments from GCC has been relatively modest in India in the past compared to say China.</li>
 	<li>Improving remittance from the 2.75 million diaspora to keep its current account balance strong.</li>
 	<li>Use its IT strengths to capture a pie of the large AI market expected to be created in UAE.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">Trade ministers of both UAE and India have stated that trade of goods and services between the two countries will be increased over the next five years, achieving a target of more than USD 115billion in bilateral trade. UAE has taken up active pursuit of trade negotiations with several countries to step up its foreign trade, a key requirement for achieving its economic goals in post COVID-19 era. India on the other side is pursuing an ambitious import export policy to step up its global trade in a big way as part of its economic push. The Emirates aims to double its economic size in the next 10 years. India has ambitions to become a USD 5trillion economy from its current economic size of USD 3trillion.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Both nations are trying to conclude a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) and hope to sign a free trade agreement in March 2022. A new strategic economic agreement is expected to increase bilateral trade in goods to USD 100billion within five years of the signed agreement. The remaining growth can be expected to be generated from trade in services. The agreement is aimed at increasing investments and job opportunities in both the countries, goals that are being actively pursued by the respective governments. Recently, UAE announced its plans to sign comprehensive economic partnership deals with eight countries to consolidate its position as a global gateway for investment and trade. The UAE would bilaterally pursue comprehensive economic accords with the eight countries on trade, foreign direct investment and sectors like tourism. UAE’s large Indian community of professionals, more than 2.75 million workers and several successful businessmen is expected to aid achieving the bilateral trade push. India plays an important role in UAE’s tourism industry as Indian tourists’ visit every year in large numbers - exceeded one million in H1 2019. UAE’s sovereign wealth fund has pumped in multibillion-dollar investments into India’s telecom and retail businesses through the private sector players boosting the trade relations between the two economies.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">According to available data, UAE was India’s third largest trading partner with about USD 59.8billion of bilateral trade in 2019 and its second-largest export destination after the U.S with exports valued at about USD 30billion. India is one of the preferred destinations for UAE’s crude supplies. Indian work force is one of the largest country contingents among all.</p>

		<Title>[:en]Fintech in Islamic finance: How Kuwaiti banks are pioneering the trend[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>This article was first published in</strong> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L9N1BqbkJk8FSDebs780eZM8pollPOS0/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>IFN Volume 18 Issue 40 dated the 6th October 2021</strong></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Technology continues to disrupt the traditional industries and Islamic banking is not an exception. Fintech, short for financial technology, is an omnibus term that basically includes any technology which helps the banks and other financial institutions deliver services and products to their customers faster and in a more efficient way. Today anything from cryptocurrency to e-payment services come under the ambit of fintech.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Islamic fintech is a segment of financial technology that adheres to the Shariah principles. It has the same values and ethics which form the basics of Islamic finance. There are approximately 30 fintech companies operating in Kuwait (Arab regional fintech guide realised in July 2021).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Though it is still in its nascent stage in Kuwait, there has been tremendous growth in the recent past. Driving force behind this might be Kuwait’s established financial sector, flourishing entrepreneurial ecosystem and its globally exposed population with a strong business acumen.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">High level of mobile penetration has also laid a strong foundation for innovative fintech. The pandemic provided additional impetus to the adoption of fintech by traditional banks. Lockdowns and fear of the virus spread accelerated trends like contactless payments.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Two sides of a coin</strong>
The main advantage of Islamic fintech is transparency, increased financial inclusion, cost effectiveness, easy accessibility and usage. On the flip side, some of the biggest shortcomings include security concerns, some products can be difficult for non tech savvy people to understand and use, shortage of personnel having knowledge over fintech and principles of Shariah and lack of proper regulations governing them.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Kuwait government has been taking numerous steps like establishment of regulatory sandboxes and forming a dedicated Fintech Unit to encourage the adoption of fintech. With the ongoing pandemic, celebrations had also become digital. Central Bank of Kuwait launched an app called “Eidity” enabling the public to send and receive Eidia electronically.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>If you can’t beat them, join them!</strong>
Kuwait Islamic banks have teamed up with financial technology companies to provide various digital services and products or for digitalisation of their banking processes. Traditional banks have the resources to fund fintechs and the relatively new companies will have the expertise and know-how lacking with traditional banks, hence a win-win situation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Islamic banks like Kuwait International Bank and Kuwait Finance House have partnered with tech companies like ProgressSoft, Mobiquity & Aion Digital to help them achieve their digital transformation goals.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Recent trends and innovative products launched by Islamic banks in Kuwait</strong>
Segments of Islamic fintech that Kuwaiti banks have shown interest include Deposits & Lending, Payments, Wealth Management, Insurance, Social Finance and Banking Operations. Open banking is another area which offers attractive benefits to Islamic finance. It is a secure banking model which enables third parties to access customers’ financial information with customers’ consent. Islamic financial institutions are also keen on establishing a fully digital bank.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">All major listed banks in Kuwait have enabled Samsung/Garmin/Fitbit pay feature. Kuwait Finance House, had launched an Electronic Forms Solution that fully transforms traditional banking forms into electronic ones.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Boubyan Bank has been introducing various digital services and products for its customers. The recent one being the launch of world’s first Islamic international digital bank “Nomo” in July this year. It is a fully licenced and regulated UK Islamic digital bank. Eligible Kuwait customers will be able to open their new UK account within minutes through the app.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On this note, Agility, a Kuwait based Logistics Company, has applied for a licence to open a digital bank. If the company is successful, it will be Kuwait’s first independent digital bank.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Outlook</strong>
As per the Global Islamic fintech report 2021, the market size of Islamic fintech in Kuwait, one of the fast maturing ecosystems, is expected to increase to US$7 billion in 2025 from US$2 billion in 2020, representing a growth rate of 25% (CAGR) much higher than the global growth rate of 21%.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Conclusion</strong>
The never ending pandemic, growing young Muslim population seem to add fuel to the growth of Islamic fintechs. Market participants have to be agile and update themselves with the changing trends. While some Islamic banks are lagging behind in terms of the digital products and services being offered, banks in Kuwait seem to be well ahead of the curve.</p>[:]]]></Content>

		<Title>[:en]What’s behind Kuwait’s increasing fiscal breakeven oil price?[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">For long, Kuwait’s fiscal breakeven oil price remained low and it had been a key strength for the economy. However, the situation is fast changing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Fiscal breakeven oil price can be defined simply as the oil price that balances an oil‐exporting country’s fiscal budget. Upon comparing a country’s fiscal breakeven oil price with the international oil price, one can gauge the fiscal health of the country. Lower fiscal breakeven oil price than the market price would lead to surplus and vice-versa.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Kuwait Fiscal breakeven oil price has steadily increased over the years</strong>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Kuwait-Fiscal-breakeven-oil-price-has-steadily-increased-over-the-years.jpg" alt="Kuwait Fiscal breakeven oil price has steadily increased over the years" width="800" height="762" />
<span style="color: #696969; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;">Source: Regional Economic Outlook Report, IMF</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Kuwait’s fiscal breakeven oil price (FBEP) that had been hovering below USD 50/bbl has steadily increased in the recent years, reaching USD 68.1/barrel in 2020, nearly a 24% increase relative to 2019. When compared to its GCC counterparts, UAE’s FBEP increased by 10.5% whereas Saudi Arabia and Qatar witnessed a fall in their breakeven price of 7.5% and 5.0%, respectively for the same period.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Further, according to the IMF estimates, UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar are set to see a drop in their breakeven prices in 2021 as compared to Kuwait, which is expected to witness a further increase in the breakeven price by roughly 2%.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In 2020, governments around the world experienced fiscal deficits due to expansionary fiscal policies to support economic trough coupled with slumping government revenues especially for oil exporting nations with oil prices bottoming on the back of disrupted global operations and weak demand.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Kuwait’s high dependency on oil is underscored with hydrocarbon revenues accounting for about 90% of total revenues (excludes investment income). The impact of oil price cyclicality on Kuwait’s fiscal balance is evident from the recent oil boom-bust cycle. Kuwait’s budget for the year ending 2021 marked the highest fiscal deficit the country has ever witnessed, KD 10.8billion, a 175% increase relative to the previous year. The expenditure pattern for Kuwait remains rigid with salaries and subsides accounting for 73% of total expenditure, while growth inducing capital expenditures accounted for a mere 9%.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">OPEC+ has capped the oil production for its members until 2022, consequentially also capping the government revenue for Kuwait. With the rigidities in expenditure persisting and a cap on oil production, the government expects the fiscal deficit to deepen to KD 12.1 billion for the year ending 2022.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Despite positive outlook for oil prices with the global economic recovery, there is a need for urgent reforms in the Kuwait economy, to put its finances on a more sustainable footing, as monetary tools are not sufficient to address structural challenges, as noted recently by the Kuwait central bank.</p>[:]]]></Content>

		<Title>[:en]The Middle East Is Looking to Dominate the Hydrogen Race[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">Climate control having become a top item on global agenda there is a rush to adopt non-fossil fuel sources like wind, solar and hydrogen. The development of wind and solar energy is progressing rapidly and the cost of power generation from these sources is falling rapidly. The renewable power sector growth is fueling ambitions for a hydrogen fuel economy for transportation, power generation, industry and residential heating purposes. Sources indicate that we may see hydrogen starting to become competitive with other fossil fuels during the 2025-30 period.</p>
Blue hydrogen produced from burning natural gas is not carbon free as it involves burning methane that produces carbon dioxide which is trapped up to 90 percent through carbon-capture technology where carbon is stored underground, which requires considerable capital costs, or it is reused as a feedstock for industrial applications, in which CO2 is still ultimately released into the atmosphere. Green hydrogen uses renewable energy to power the electrolysis that splits water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. Electrolysis requires energy. That this energy comes from lower-cost renewable sources is what makes this form of hydrogen “green. There is no carbon dioxide produced in electrolysis of water.
<p style="text-align: left;">Global demand for “green hydrogen”, produced with minimal carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, could reach about 530 million tons (Mt) by 2050, same as roughly 10.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent (around 37 percent of pre-pandemic global oil production). Green hydrogen export market could be worth USD 300 billion yearly by 2050, creating 400,000 jobs globally in renewable energy and hydrogen production.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The hydrogen transition won’t happen overnight because it’s expensive. Per unit of energy, hydrogen supply costs are 1.5 to 5 times those of natural gas. However, advances in electrolysis technology, decreasing costs of renewables, and increased economies of scale should significantly reduce its production cost and make it an economically viable solution. Lower-cost green hydrogen will lead to benefits in a range of industries and advance the goal of making countries and companies more environmentally sustainable. This will apply to current applications of green hydrogen and new ones. As a result, the demand for green hydrogen is projected to grow significantly by 2050. Blue hydrogen will be a key player to reach 2030 carbon reduction goal even though this method isn’t zero-carbon. The consumption of green hydrogen should be a long-term goal.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Green hydrogen represents a promising opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. They can produce green hydrogen to boost domestic industries and for export. Although countries such as China and the U.S. are seeking to invest in green hydrogen, their export prospects are limited by large domestic demand that will probably consume most of their production. By contrast, GCC countries can export much of their green hydrogen and still have ample, low-cost renewable energy. Saudi Arabia and UAE in the GCC have taken active steps to produce blue hydrogen initially. The competition to these GCC countries is from Australia, which is also one of the first to step into the race by taking up initial investments for hydrogen production with the Japanese and Korean markets that are creating hydrogen usage infrastructure as initial targets. The GCC countries also have South Asian countries as potential target markets. The question is who will dominate the hydrogen export market? The GCC countries have the potential to lead the race due to certain competitive advantages due to the following.</p>

<ul class="rdetails_list">
 	<li> UAE has a "combined competitive advantage" to produce blue and green hydrogen and is taking early-mover advantage in the global hydrogen business. ADNOC, has joined with Mubadala and holding company ADQ to form the Abu Dhabi Hydrogen Alliance. ADNOC, which has been mandated by the government to become a global 'hydrogen leader,' has a head start with a 1 Mtpa blue ammonia project already underway.</li>
 	<li> UAE could be among the lowest cost producers of blue hydrogen in the world, while its significant advantages extend also to green hydrogen. Among world regions, the Gulf countries enjoy excellent natural conditions for blue and green hydrogen production. Moreover, the country’s excellent large-scale infrastructure and shipping provide a strong basis for the production and export of hydrogen and hydrogen-derived products. Given the GCC location, and the relatively high cost of hydrogen transport (as compared to LNG, for example), UAE could find an export destination in the countries of South Asia.</li>
 	<li> GCC countries have considerable advantages in solar energy which is required for green hydrogen due to availability of abundant sunshine, large barren flat land for setting up renewable power capacity and water availability from their coast lines.</li>
 	<li> GCC countries have large access to capital and possess energy trade expertise and have low domestic power and hydrogen consumption leaving exportable surplus. The investments required to meet green hydrogen export demand in 2050 are around $2.1 trillion. Of this total, $1 trillion is needed to build the dedicated renewable energy capacity, $900 billion to set up the hydrogen conversion and export facilities, and $200 billion to develop the water electrolysis facilities.</li>
 	<li> Saudi Arabia has potential to become a leader in carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) and related technologies which are essential for blue hydrogen production.</li>
 	<li> Saudi Arabia’s megaproject NEOM, has the $5bn Helios Green Fuels project that could make it the first functioning ‘hydrogen valley’ for green hydrogen and ammonia production.</li>
 	<li> In the coming years other GCC countries may follow UAE and Saudi Arabia in their hydrogen production initiatives.</li>

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">Oil prices in October hovered over their highest since 2014, with demand pressures exceeding supply. Expectation of higher natural gas prices encouraging a switch to oil and continued relaxation of travel restrictions supported prices. Supply is also expected to be tighter with Saudi Arabia’s oil minister dismissing calls for a steeper increase in output. IEA expects current energy crunch to boost oil demand by 500,000 bpd. It estimates the resulting supply gap to be at 700,000 bpd until OPEC+ increases supply as planned in January 2022. The White House is set to remove travel restrictions for fully vaccinated foreign nationals from 8th November that is expected to raise the jet fuel demand.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Oil prices closed at a high of USD 84.4 per barrel at the end of the month. The rise in prices for crude oil witnessed a slowdown with positive inventory reports from the American Petroleum Institute, reporting 2.32-million-barrel crude oil stockpiles but bounced back and closed on a high with expectations of OPEC and its allies sticking to their production stance.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">OPEC’s meeting in October concluded with members maintaining status quo in supply policy, and increasing demand monthly as agreed in the prior meetings, despite pressures from the oil biggest consuming countries. OPEC has also trimmed the outlook for growth in world oil demand to 5.8 million barrels per day in 2021 compared to the earlier forecast of 5.96 million barrels. The U.S. EIA increased their Brent price forecasts to USD 71.38 and USD 71.91 per barrel for 2021 and 2022 from USD 68.1 and USD 66.4 respectively.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">In the third quarter, Green, social, sustainability and sustainability-linked (GSSS) bond issuance reached USD 217bn and is poised to reach USD 1tn for FY21 (vs USD 614bn issued in 2020) as per a recent Moody’s report. Companies look at funding alternatives for their ESG transition plans and banks want to increase their share of impact financing, leading to the recent increase in ESG linked loans.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The 26th UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) commenced on Oct 31st and might provide more clarity on various issues related with ESG. World leaders will try to decide on steeper emission cuts to curb rising temperatures around the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Closer to home, Saudi Arabia has recently announced its plans to have net zero emissions by 2060 with Aramco having a goal to reach it a decade early. This has been extensively criticised as they don’t include the emissions coming from the customers burning the fuels. Also, the KSA continues to invest in expanding its production capacity.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The oversubscription of loans issued by GIB &amp; Arab petroleum act as a testament to the growing demand for ESG instruments like SLLs (Sustainability Linked Loan). Qatar energy (previously Qatar petroleum) is also said to be working on an ESG framework to sell green bonds.</p>

		<Title>[:en]Bitcoin and Ethereum touch all-time high in October[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">October marked a record-breaking month for cryptocurrencies with Bitcoin touching its all-time high in October. With bitcoin price soaring, the market cap for bitcoin also breached the 1 trillion threshold. The second largest cryptocurrency – Ethereum, also touched its all-time high of USD 4,402 in October, on the back of upward crypto momentum and a recent technical upgrade to the Ethereum network. Ethereum based meme cryptocurrency – Shiba Inu soared 155% in the last week of October and 1,000% over the month, to become the eighth largest cryptocurrency in the world. The increase is said to be driven by huge volumes among retail investors.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Performance and Key Metrics</strong>

<p style="text-align: left;">The upwards momentum is said to be driven by the launch of the first U.S. bitcoin futures-based ETF – ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which closed 2.59% higher on its debut day, and became the fastest ETF to reach the USD 1billion AUM within two days of its launch. Although analysts reported that, the trading seemed to be influenced by High-Frequency Trading firms and small investors, indicating the lack of institutional investors’ participation via large block trades. After touching it’s high, Bitcoin marked a slight decline in the closing weeks due to profit booking by various participants.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Along with ProShares ETF, VanEck is set to launch a bitcoin ETF as well. The SEC also approved Valkyrie Investment’s Bitcoin futures ETF that started trading from 22 October. Valkyrie has plans to expand further by filling for a leveraged bitcoin futures ETF days later after its ETF started trading.</p>

		<Title>[:en]Blue Chip Laggards in GCC Equity Markets[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">The GCC Equity markets like the rest of the major world markets have been having a stellar run in 2021. Until November 21st the S &amp; P GCC Composite Index has generated Year-to-Date (YTD) return of 35.6%, which has not been seen for many years in these markets. Valuation-wise, GCC composite index trades at P/E ratio of 23.3 and the current index value is still at a discount of 47.4% compared to its historical peak value. The performance of the individual markets is as given below:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/performance-of-the-individual-markets_fig1.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="762" />
<span style="color: #696969; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;">Source: Refinitiv; Note: Data as of Nov 20, 2021 close</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">All the markets except for Qatar and Oman to a lesser extent have given high YTD returns. All the markets except Abu Dhabi and Kuwait are still much below their peak value. However, despite the overall Bull Run in these markets, some of the blue chips have not participated in the rally and remain surprising laggards. These include the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/blue-chips-which-not-participated-in-the-rally_fig2.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="762" />
<span style="color: #696969; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;">Source: Refinitiv; Note: Data as of Nov 20, 2021 close</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There could be different reasons for different blue chips concerning their below market performance during the year. In the case of Saudi Aramco, its value is near its all-time peak and its P/E Ratio is at the market average though it is a behemoth in the market both of which may be putting a cap to further appreciation in value that can be expected during the current period. In the case of Saudi Telecom Company its P/E Ratio is below that of the market, but it is to be noted that its business in 2020 fared well despite COVID-19 and the share price did not therefore fall significantly in 2020 like the broader index shares thus providing a relatively higher baseline for 2021.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Mobile Telecommunications Company, Kuwait has been a laggard but then its PE Ratio is at the same level as that for the Kuwaiti market and its business performance in 2021 was below that in 2020 due to lower revenues caused by currency devaluation that adversely affected Sudan and Iraq operations coupled with Covid-19 impact that continued for some of its operations, which may be possibly limiting immediate potential for further gains. Qatar Islamic Bank clocked high 15% returns in 2020 and is at a P/E Ratio close to that of the market but more importantly a possible explanation for its sub-market performance in 2021 may be its price being close to the peak price that will require a performance impetus to push its price higher. Masraf Al Rayan clocked high 21% returns in 2020, has lack luster growth in 2021 and has a P/E Ratio above that of the Qatar market indicating an already premium valuation for the company that possibly caps potential for large appreciation during 2021. All in all, some of the blue chips have remained market laggards in 2021, but it remains to be seen whether they will win market fancy in coming quarters.</p>[:]]]></Content>

		<Title>[:en]Oil declines in November on concerns of lower demand owing to COVID-19 variant[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]Oil prices declined steeply in November, marking its largest monthly decline since March 2020. The fall follows the multi-year high prices posted by the commodity in October. Concerns over lower demand on account of new COVID-19 variant, Omicron, and expectation of increase in supply due to release of Strategic Petroleum Reserves by the U.S pressured prices during the month.

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Performance of Oil</strong>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Performance-of-Oil_nov_21_Fig-1.jpg" alt="Performance of Oil" width="800" height="762" />

U.S plans to release about 50 million barrels of oil from its reserves. China, Japan, India, South Korea and U.K would also be releasing oil from their reserves in coordination with the U.S to contain oil prices and in turn inflation. According to IEA, this would be the fourth such coordinated move since the agency’s inception in 1974. 

European countries have tightened COVID-19 restrictions and imposed lockdowns on account of surge in cases. Identification of new COVID-19 variant in South Africa and concerns over its spread across countries weighed on oil prices. The commodity dropped as much as USD 10/bbl on Nov 27th, its largest daily drop since April 2020.

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Oil Demand and Supply</strong>

<span style="color: #696969; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;">Source: EIA</span></p>

OPEC has reduced its Q4 2021 demand forecast for oil by 330,000 bpd citing slower economic recovery due to higher energy prices. Morgan Stanley has revised downwards its Q1 2022 oil price forecast from USD 95/bbl to USD 82.5/bbl citing lower demand due to Omicron COVID-19 variant.

IEA has revised upwards its average Brent crude oil price assumption for 2022 by USD 2.60/bbl to USD79.40. However, it expects the recent rally in prices to ease off as three-year high price levels seen in October would incentivize global production. EIA expects oil prices to decline in 2022, with Brent crude averaging at USD 66/bbl in December 2022, on account of rising production from OPEC+ and U.S and slowdown in growth in oil demand.

Price of Natural Gas declined for the month on increasing production and expectation of a warmer winter. Approval of Nord Stream 2 pipeline which would carry natural gas from Russia to Germany was delayed by German regulator citing non-submission of necessary paperwork. EIA expects U.S natural gas production to reach record high in 2021, with LNG production expected to be at 9.81 bcfd in 2021 and 11.49 bcfd in 2022, up from 6.53 bcfd in 2020.

		<Title>[:en]GCC Fixed Income: Ratings outlook of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain upgraded to stable[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]Saudi Arabia and Bahrain saw outlook upgrades in November. Moody’s has revised Saudi Arabia’s outlook from negative to stable on expectation that country would reverse most of its 2020 debt increase while maintaining fiscal buffers. S&P has revised Bahrain's outlook to stable from negative, citing the fiscal reforms undertaken to strengthen its economy. Higher oil prices and support from other GCC members are also expected to help the country improve its fiscal position.

The countries had also issued bonds during the month. Saudi Arabia has sold USD 2bn of Islamic debt maturing in 9 1/2 years and USD 1.25bn of 30-year conventional bonds yielding 3.36%. According to Bloomberg, Saudi government and its sovereign wealth fund are preparing to launch green bonds in the coming months. Bahrain has raised USD 2bn with dual-tranche bond with USD 1bn in 7-1/2-year sukuk at 3.875% and USD 1bn in 12-1/2-year conventional bonds at 5.625%.

Gulf Insurance Group has raised KD 60 million in two tranches, one with a fixed coupon of 4.5% and another with a floating coupon of 2.75% over the Central Bank of Kuwait’s discount rate. Warba Bank has mandated Standard Chartered Bank for an offering of fixed periodic distribution amount USD-denominated Regulation S PNC5 Basel III compliant Tier 1 Capital Certificates. It has also invited holders of its outstanding RegS of USD 250mn Perpetual Tier 1 Capital Certificates to tender all of such Existing Capital Certificates for cash.

Ratings for UAE and Qatar were affirmed by Fitch and S&P respectively. Fitch affirmed UAE at 'AA-’ with stable outlook citing moderate consolidated public debt, strong net external asset position and high GDP per capita. S&P has affirmed Qatar’s ratings at ‘AA-/A-1+’ with stable outlook. While acknowledging that the rapid growth in external funding of Qatar’s banks present balance of payment risk, S&P considers the country’s substantial buffers to be a mitigation factor.

Moody's has affirmed ratings of 9 Saudi Banks and has changed their outlook to stable from negative on the back of the banks’ resilient performance. Fitch Ratings has affirmed the credit ratings of First Abu Dhabi Bank, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank, Dubai Islamic Bank and Mashreq Bank.

<p style="text-align: left;">All sectors, except Healthcare and Insurance, declined in November. Insurance was the top gainer, rising 7.6% followed by healthcare which recorded modest gains of 1.8%. Basic materials and Industrials sector indices registered the biggest decline, falling 10.4% and 7% respectively, for the month.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Kuwait recorded a deficit of KD 10.8 billion in FY 2020-21, an increase of 174.8%, which is the highest budget deficit in the country's history. In addition to this, the IMF has projected that Kuwait will record the highest non-oil budget deficit among GCC countries at 68.7% in 2021.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On a positive note, Kuwaiti Government agencies have achieved a savings of about 25% of the target for reduction of their expenditures in the current fiscal year budget. The budget deficit for the seven months of FY 2021-22 was lower than expected at KD 1.2 billion vs KD 3.8 billion for the seven months of FY 2020-21, owing to higher oil revenues on the back of increased oil prices.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Domestic credit in Kuwait had increased 4% YoY in 9M 2021 and was driven by an 11% increase in household credit in 9M 2021 vs 9M 2020. Corporate credit has been slow to recover as they still continue to be pressured by the effects of COVID along with factors like high levels of repayments/write offs hindering meaningful growth.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Most Premier market stocks were negative, with the exception of Warba Bank and Integrated Holding, which were flat during November. All listed banks have come out with their Q3 results with aggregate Net interest income in 9M 2021 surpassing the levels of 9M 2020 but are yet to reach pre COVID levels owing to the prevailing low interest rate environment.</p>

In a market that is already concerned about the spread of the new variant and efficacy of the vaccinations against it, the recent hawkish comments from the Federal Reserve Chairman prevented them from fully recovering the sell-off.
Energy sector stocks had a double blow wherein in addition to falling share prices, oil prices also declined, making them more unattractive.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">COVID cases have been rising in Austria, Germany and other parts of Europe with some of these counties reimposing complete lockdowns. Investors fear that these new restrictions might add pressure to the nascent economic recovery and existing supply chain woes.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The Canadian markets remained resilient for most part of the month, but fell slightly resulting from macro-economic factors like increasing COVID cases in Europe, spread of the new COVID variant and comments from the US Federal Reserve Chairman suggesting the central banks could remove the stimulus sooner than expected. It still has one of the highest YTD returns at 21%.</p>

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">GCC markets were also down, as evidenced by the S&P GCC composite index, which fell 5.0% for November. Weakness in Oil prices derailed the rally of GCC markets barring the UAE, with the Abu Dhabi (8.7%) and Dubai (7.3%) indices remaining resilient due to reforms announced by the government. Saudi Arabia and Qatar equity indices fell 8.1% and 3.2% respectively, as Saudi markets were affected by the sharp cuts in oil prices.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Dubai markets remained resilient despite the turbulence in oil markets as investors were enthused by the recent reforms undertaken by the government. Dubai unveiled plans to list utility company DEWA, which would be one among 10 government entities to be listed in the local stock exchange in the coming months. The move was followed by the decision to overhaul the board of the stock exchange.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Abu Dhabi Index has had one of the greatest performing years with YTD gains amounting to 69%. It has launched a derivatives market, where investors can trade in single equity futures of some of the bourse's companies. The exchange has also proposed a regulatory framework enabling the listing of special-purpose acquisition companies (SPACs).</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Rating agency Moody’s stated that the sovereign creditworthiness of GCC countries is expected to be stable in the upcoming 12 to 18 months due to supportive oil prices and higher production.</p>

		<Title>[:en]Most cryptocurrencies decline in November due to worries over COVID-19 variant and regulatory pressures[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">Most cryptocurrencies declined in November on the back of concerns over the new COVID-19 variant, tax-reporting requirement in the U.S infrastructure bill and China’s increasing clampdown on cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">U.S’ USD 1 trillion infrastructure bill includes a provision for brokers to report information on crypto traders transacting an amount of over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue Services (IRS). The lack of clarity in the bill on the term ‘broker’ raised doubts about the new regulations requiring compliance from market participants such as miners, causing weakness in the crypto markets. However, a bipartisan group of U.S House representatives have introduced a bill that would provide more clarity and would define the term ‘broker’, such that software developers without the required customer information are not bound by the new provisions.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The digital asset has also been seeing increasing regulatory pressure. China’s National Development and Reform Commission plans to crack down on industrial-scale bitcoin mining as well as the involvement of state firms in mining of cryptocurrencies. India would be introducing a bill to regulate cryptocurrencies. The bill would seek to create a facilitative framework for an official digital currency while prohibiting all private cryptocurrencies. IMF has cautioned against El Savador’s adoption of cryptocurrency as legal tender given the significant risks that the move poses for consumer protection, financial integrity, and financial stability.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">U.S banking regulators intend to clarify in 2022 what role traditional banks can legally play in the cryptocurrency market. This would include holding it on their balance sheets, issuing stablecoins and holding crypto assets and facilitating crypto trading on behalf of customers. Bitcoin’s AUM has reportedly fallen by 9.5% to $48.7 billion in November, marking the year’s largest month-on-month pullback since July.</p>

		<Title>[:en]ESG indices outperform their conventional indices[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">Global equity markets witnessed a decline in the month of November, as investors took the flight to safety and resorted to safe haven assets, due to uncertainty stirred in the market by the new covid variant – Omicron. In times high uncertainty and vola tility, ESG indices displayed low beta relative to their comparative indices. Despite negative returns, ESG indices outperformed their conventional indices, apart from Japan that underperformed mildly for the month of November.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>ESG Indices performance </strong>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ESG-Indices-performance_fig1.jpg" alt="ESG Indices performance" width="800" height="762" />
<span style="color: #696969; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;">Source: S&P; as of 30th November 2021</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Last year ESG funds attracted 51.1 billion in net investments, and the trend looks to continue in the current year. ESG investing to harvest alpha seems prevalent by the YTD returns of the ESG indices relative to their conventional indices, where all the ESG indices outperformed their benchmark. As per the new study conducted by KPMG, CEOs in Saudi Arabia are transitioning their companies to incorporate ESG principles, with 42% of surveyed CEOs expressing their intention to invest more than 10% of their revenues towards sustainable practices. Saudi Arabia also prepares to launch its first green bond that targets at raising billions of dollars to finance projects powered entirely by renewable energy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The 26th UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) concluded in November, that saw member states reach consensus on a climate deal with an explicit plan to reduce coal, which is identified as a key contributor to global warming. The deal was met with resistance from the coal-reliant countries, and the clause was amended from “phase out” to “phase down” for countries to come to a consensus. The current carbon cuts however are estimated to restrict global warming to 2.4C, far from the target of 1.5C. UAE also announced the launch of a finance facility to tackle climate change. Energy Transition Accelerator Financing is the financing mechanism being set up to assist developing countries to adapt renewable energy. The UAE has committed $400 million in funding to the platform, with a goal to reach a minimum of $1 billion in total funding.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In terms of ESG investing, the information and data reporting is a key issue for asset managers. Limited access to such information might hamper the acceleration of capital towards sustainable countries, especially in emerging economies. In a bid to resolve this issue, asset manager - Arabesque developed a platform named – “ESG Book”. The founders also include the World Bank's International Finance Corporation, QUICK, Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing, Glass Lewis, Bank Islam, Allianz X, Goldbeck and the Climate Bonds Initiative. ESG Book aims at providing real time ESG related data in real-time for free. Increasing transparency and comparability of ESG related reporting can make the ESG Book a gamechanger in the ESG data reporting domain.</p>

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]Kuwait markets ended the year positively, with the recovery in oil prices supporting gains. Kuwait All Share index gained 27.0% in 2021, following a rise of 3.7% in December. 

<strong>Market Performance & Key Metrics</strong>

Among sectors, Boursa Kuwait’s Consumer Discretionary sector was the top gainer, rising 9.9% for the month, followed by Financial Services at 5.5%. Technology sector index declined the most, falling 7.8% for the month. Banking sector index was up by 4.2% in December. Kuwait’s performance throughout the year has been positive despite concerns pertaining to liquidity after an impasse over the passage of a debt law that allows the state to tap the international debt markets for funding. The sharp recovery in oil prices alleviated these concerns and paved way for the recovery of the economy, which in turn supported the gains in Kuwaiti equities.

<strong>Sectoral Performance & Key Metrics</strong>

<span style="color: #696969; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;">Source: Refinitiv</span></p>

Kuwait’s 9M 2021 corporate earnings indicate that companies are on a path of gradual recovery. However, they have not reached pre-pandemic levels yet in terms of profitability. Banking stocks, which constitutes more than half of Kuwait’s listed space by market capitalization, has witnessed their 9M 2021 earnings rebound 72% compared to 9M 2020. However, they are still 16% lower than 9M 2019.

Kuwait’s real GDP is expected to grow by 4.3% in 2022 supported by higher oil prices during the year according to the IMF. Inflation remains a key worry moving into 2022 due to supply chain shocks and rising global food prices. According to World Bank’s lead economist for the Gulf, Kuwait had made least progress among GCC states to reform its wage bill. He has also stated that hiring has increased in recent years with one-third of the Kuwaiti civil service has been recruited in the past five years, making the wage bill unsustainable.

<strong>Premier Market Stocks' Performance</strong>

The S&P GCC composite index ended the year with gains of 31.4%, following a 4.0% rise in December 2021. Abu Dhabi was the best performer among GCC markets, gaining 68.2% for the year followed by Saudi Arabia with yearly gains of 29.8%.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">During December, Saudi equity market outperformed its peers, increasing 4.8% followed by Dubai equity market that increased by 4.0% in December. The outperformance of Saudi market is driven by its banking sector that soared on the back of mortgage boom attributed to country’s target of 70% home ownership among nationals. As the economy marks a strong rebound, there is also a marked increase in non-mortgage retail lending and corporate lending. Saudi Arabia’s banking sector released their interim financial results for Q3 2021, with net profit marking a 12% YoY growth for nine months ending September. Saudi’s largest banks – Al Rajhi and SNB witnessed an increase of 7.3% and 6.6% respectively in their share price, with a fall in provisions and a subsequent increase in net profits.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Abu Dhabi market witnessed a drop this month, with its blue-chip stocks – Alpha Dhabi Holdings and First Abu Dhabi Bank decreasing 4.5% and 1.8% respectively over the month. Despite the drop, Abu Dhabi remains the top performing market within the GCC, with a return of 68.2% over the year.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The outlook for UAE remains positive, with forecasts of its economy returning to pre-pandemic levels by Q1’2022. This comes from a combination of rising oil prices and increased production baseline, coupled with the boost in tourism sector, that accounts for 16% of its GDP, provided by the Dubai Expo 2020.</p>

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">U.S. inflation has surged to the highest levels seen since 1990 at 6.2% (Y/Y) due to factors such as higher shelter and car prices, which are both expected to continue rising as 2022 starts. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted to maintain the current Fed Funds rate at the zero-lower bound (0.00% – 0.25%) and accelerate the pace of tapering its asset purchase program to USD 30bn per month starting in mid-January from the current USD 15bn.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Investors received FOMC participants’ revised outlooks through 2024. Growth expectations were downgraded for years 2021 and 2023 but upgraded for 2022. Inflation expectations were revised up, forecasts for core PCE increased 0.7% to 4.4% in 2021, 0.4% to 2.7% in 2022, 0.1% to 2.3% in 2023, and steady at 2.1% in 2024. The unemployment forecast is steadying out at 3.5% in 2022-2024.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The median of the committee now expects eight rate hikes through 2024 starting in 2022. The median of the Committee expects three rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, and two rate hikes in 2024. The Fed’s long-run neutral rate of 2.5% was not changed.</p>

		<Title>[:en]Assessing the impact of UAE’s corporate tax[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">Moving away from oil dependence has been viewed as a crucial step to ensure sustainable growth in UAE and broader GCC, with taxation being a key means to increase the share of non-oil revenue. UAE has already taken that step in 2018 when it introduced 5% Value-added tax. Now it has taken a step further in this direction through introduction of 9% corporate tax at federal level from June 01, 2023.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Decline in oil prices since mid-2014, followed by the impact of COVID-19 on oil prices in 2020 have emphasized the importance of diversifying revenue sources for GCC governments. For instance, while UAE’s fiscal balance has averaged at 5.6% of GDP over 2000-2017, it had plummeted to -5.6% of GDP in 2020 and is estimated to be a deficit in 2021 and 2022 (IMF REO October 2021, General Government Fiscal Balance). In this context, improving non-oil revenue is of paramount importance to UAE as it can provide some stability to its fiscal framework. As per our initial calculations, revenue generated from the proposed 9% corporate tax could amount to about $13 billion amounting to 14-15% of the total non-oil revenue of the government.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Impact of corporate tax implementation </strong>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Impact-of-corporate-tax-implementation_fig_1.jpg" alt="Impact of corporate tax implementation" width="800" height="762" />
<span style="color: #696969; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;">Source: IMF, Marmore Research; Note: Operating surplus is assumed at 55% and fixed capital consumption (proxy for depreciation) is considered at 12%</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As four of the six GCC countries already levy corporate taxes, the move would not have a negative impact on attractiveness of UAE as business destination. The proposed tax rate also remains competitive compared to the low-tax hubs such as Montenegro (9%) and Ireland (12.5%).</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The tax would be applicable for companies with profits greater than AED 375,000 ($102,000). While the exemption of free zones that comply with all regulations and do not conduct business with mainland UAE companies from the corporate tax might impact tax revenue, it could help in maintaining the free zones’ attractiveness for businesses. However, companies in free zone reportedly pay indirect taxes like annual licence fee. Streamlining such expenses to bring taxation on all corporate entities under a single umbrella, increasing the level of profit exemption accompanied by increase in tax rate are some of the next steps that could be considered to benefit SMEs and to further improve the country’s tax regime. In the backdrop of OECD’s initiative to levy a global minimum tax rate, a different tax rate would be applicable for multinationals that meet criteria set with reference to “Pillar Two” of the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Following the country’s implementation of 5% VAT in 2018, the current move to implement corporate tax would have a positive impact on UAE’s fiscal position by better insulating it from volatility of oil prices.</p>[:]]]></Content>

		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">U.S. consumer prices rose solidly in January 2022 (7.5%, YoY), leading to the biggest annual increase in inflation in 40 years, fueling financial markets speculation for a hefty 50 basis points interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve next month, which would be first since 2018. There are concerns that the US central bank would be more aggressive in its intensity of rate hikes and Goldman Sachs expects the Federal Reserve would be raising interest rates seven times this year with a 25 basis-point hike in each of the remaining meetings. The Bank of England raised interest rates for the first time in more than three years in December 2021, followed by another increase this month taking bank rate to 0.5%.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The central banks of GCC countries generally tweak their interest rate alongside the changes in the US Federal Reserve Rate, considering the pegged exchange rate regimes. GCC banks are expected to be positively geared to increase in interest rates. During 2015-19 there was an interest rate hike cycle which witnessed a substantial increase in market capitalization of certain GCC banks.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Saudi Arabia’s banks are expected to gain from the interest rate increase because of their higher proportion of non-interest bearing deposits and current and savings account deposits that carry marginal or no interest costs. These types of deposits comprise about 70 to 75 per cent of total Saudi bank deposits (based on data from 2016 to 2020) versus a GCC average of 45 per cent, and an emerging market average of about 35 per cent.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Based on our initial analysis of KSA banks’ financials, interest rate hike is expected to have a positive impact for the banks. An increase of 100 bps of interest rate with 50% pass through rate for loans and 100% pass through rate for deposits would result in an incremental profit of SAR 3.4 bn for 2022f which is 6.6% of increase to the forecasted net income for 2022F and change in ROE of +0.7%. An increase of 150 bps of interest rate with 50% pass through rate for loans and 100% pass through rate for deposits would result in an incremental profit of SAR 8.2 bn for 2022f which is 15.8% of increase to the forecasted net income for 2022F and change in ROE of +1.7%.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">USA’s consumer price index rose 7.5% y-o-y in January 2022 which is the highest 12 month increase since 1982. The financial markets speculate for a hefty 50 basis points interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve next month, which would be first since 2018. There are fears that the US central bank will be more aggressive in its rate hikes. According to Goldman Sachs predictions, the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates seven times this year, each time by 25 basis points. The Bank of England raised interest rates for the first time in more than three years in December 2021, followed by another increase this month taking bank rate to 0.5%.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Most of the GCC countries’ currencies are pegged to the dollar because of which the change in fed interest rate increase will get reflected in the interest rate of GCC countries and the GCC banks are expected to be positively geared to the change as they have significant share of the loans in floating rate category. There was an interest rate hiking cycle from 2015 to 2019, which resulted in a significant increase in the market capitalisation of several GCC banks.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Kuwaiti dinar is pegged to a basket of currencies but with more weight to dollar and hence Kuwait banks are also expected to increase the interest rate and get benefitted out of it. For instance, Gulf bank said during its 2021 earnings call that it anticipates margins to expand once the interest rate hike materializes and predicts that a 25-bps rise in the interest rate will have total impact to Net interest income of around 3 million KD annually.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Based on our initial analysis of Kuwait banks’ financials, interest rate hike is expected to have a positive impact for the banks. An increase of 100 bps of interest rate with 100% passthrough rate for loans and deposits would result in an incremental profit of KWD 289 million for 2022f which is 24.3% of increase to the forecasted net income for 2022F and change in ROE of +2.1%. However, a 100% pass-through rate for loans and 50% pass-through rate for deposits would result in an incremental profit of KWD 454 million for 2022f which is 38.1% of increase to the forecasted net income for 2022F and change in ROE of +3.4%.</p>

		<Title>[:en]GCC markets positive on multi-year high oil prices[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">In line with its GCC peers, Kuwait’s all share index gained 3.9%, supported by a continued up-trend in oil prices. Oil prices, which acted as an important factor driving the GCC stock market performance, breached the USD 100 per barrel mark in the month of February.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Among sectors, Boursa Kuwait’s Telecom sector was the top gainer, rising 10.9% followed by Consumer Discretionary at 7.6%. Technology and Energy sector index declined, falling 8.7% and 5.0% respectively. Boursa Kuwait’s banking sector index was up by 3.2% in February. Among Premier Market stocks, Gulf Cable & Electrical Industries and National Investments Company were the top gainers during the month, rising 54.4% and 28.7% respectively.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">February turned out as a month of mixed signals for Kuwait. The World Bank projects the Kuwait economy to grow by 5.3% in 2022, followed by 3% growth in 2023. The World Bank underscored the contribution of high oil prices to the national budget of the country, and the importance of developing the private sector and human capital for achieving sustainable economic growth. High inflation is seen as a potential threat to the oil price momentum. Inflation in Kuwait rose to 4.3% YoY driven by rising prices of food and housing services, which rose 7.26% and 2.44% YoY respectively in the month of January. Fitch Ratings, following the announcement of downgrade of Kuwait's sovereign rating to AA- in January, lowered the long-term Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) of 11 Kuwaiti banks. The outlook of the banks’ IDRs remains stable, reflecting on the Kuwaiti sovereign rating. Total bank deposits were down by 1.5% YoY at the end of 2021, marking its first decline in 21 years.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Regionally, S&P GCC composite index rose by 3.2% for the month, driven by upward oil price momentum. All GCC markets gained for the month apart from Oman, which witnessed a loss of 1.5%. Bahrain’s All Share Index recorded the highest gains among GCC countries, ending 8.5% higher for the month. After Bahrain, Abu Dhabi and Dubai equity indices were the biggest gainers among GCC, rising 7.1% and 4.7% respectively over the month. Qatar and Saudi Arabia equity indices also marked a gain of 3.6% and 2.6% respectively over the month. Among the GCC blue chip companies, the best performer was International Holdings Company, which gained 23.6% during the month, followed by Abu Dhabi Commercial bank, which gained 20.1%. According to a recent report by S&P Global, UAE banks are expected to benefit from the potential interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve as it anticipates the Central Bank of UAE to follow suit. Higher expected interest rates in the year ahead, coupled with rising oil prices and lower financing requirement for social spending, could lead to a fall in the GCC debt issuances in 2022.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Global equity markets witnessed tremendous volatility and inflation fears, with major indices ending in negative territory with effects more pronounced in European equity markets. Geo-political tensions surrounding Russia and Ukraine, shot the CBOE VIX index to 37.5, near to its 52-week high. A steep rise in volatility had major equity indices end the month in red, with MSCI World and S&P 500 equity indices decreasing 2.7% and 3.1% respectively. The fear in the markets was more pronounced in Europe, as evidenced by the French CAC 40 equity index and the German DAX equity index which shed 4.9% and 6.5% over the month. Eurozone and peripheral Eurozone bond yields dipped down as their prices shot up with high demand with investors taking flight to safety away from the equity markets to more defensive bond markets. U.S. consumer prices rose 7.5% YoY in January, marking the steepest yearly increase since February of 1982, while U.K. inflation rose 5.5% YoY in January to a three-decade high. Geo-political tensions coupled with economic sanctions can make inflation worries more pronounced for the global investment market. Speculation about the U.S. Federal Reserve's next move also weighed on equities, with investors eyeing on the next FOMC meeting scheduled in March, for more clarity on the magnitude of interest rate hike amid rising inflation concerns. On U.S. equities, about 78% of the 417 S&P 500 companies this reporting season posted quarterly earnings above analyst estimates as per Refinitiv data.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Oil continued its rally through February and reached multi year highs on the back of rising geo-political tensions and supply constraints against strong recovery in demand. Russia, a key member of OPEC+, produces 10% of the global oil and supplies 40% of Europe’s Gas. Although the sanctions levied on Russia do not pertain to export of oil and gas, the oil prices have already breached the USD 100 per barrel, as forecasted by majority of banks and other institutions. Gold, which is considered a safe haven asset in times of high inflation and political tensions, rose 6.2% to $1,908 in the risk-off month of February.</p>

		<Title>[:en]Five Digital Shifts Impacting KSA Banks[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">Banks have been adopting digitalization at a faster pace driven by the covid-19 pandemic situation that entailed surge in contactless transactions. There is an increase in number of fintechs in the recent past and new neo banks are emerging across the globe. Almost 53 per cent of the global population is expected to access digital banking by 2026, according to Juniper Research. In 2018, the Middle East received less than 1% of worldwide FinTech funding, but it is growing at a 30 percent compound annual growth rate according to Finextra.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
The KSA landscape is also expanding in digital banking supported by Government initiatives like SAMA’s FSDP - Vision 2030, SAMA open banking policy and Fintech Saudi. There are already 97 fintech start-ups operating in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia has approved 2 digital banking licenses in 2021 and 1 digital banking license in 2022 so far. SAMA plans to go live with open banking in the first half of 2022 and the expected benefit from open banking includes direct innovation, increased competition, increased financial inclusion and greater efficiency in the banking system. We have listed down the five most important digital shifts that are happening in KSA due to digitalization of banking and how these shifts would affect the KSA banks.</p>

<ul class="rdetails_list">
 	<li>Competition to Collaboration – We see a trend of banks either providing Fintech solutions or collaborating with FinTech companies instead of competing with them.</li>
 	<li>Brand Loyalty to Product/Service Loyalty - Banking consumers’ brand loyalty is decreasing and demand for speed, accuracy, transparency, and high-end technology is rising with millennials.</li>
 	<li>Centralized Finance to Decentralized Finance (DeFi) - Decentralized finance is an emerging financial technology that uses secure distributed ledgers similar to those used in cryptocurrencies. It eliminates the fees that banks and other financial institutions levy for using their services.</li>
 	<li>Closed Banking to Open Banking - Open Banking is a technological innovation that allows customers to exchange their data with third parties in a secure manner, which enables creation and offering of new financial services.</li>
 	<li>Impersonal to Personal Services – Customer’s data had limited use in traditional banks whereas digital banks mine customer’s data like shopping habits, location, transaction history etc. and offer custom made digital banking experience.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">What this trend leads to?
We expect this trend to result in reduction of ROE for existing banks, increased IT spending by banks, mergers & acquisitions of fintech companies, provide banks with new market opportunities and hyper-personalization of services.</p>

		<Title><![CDATA[[:en]Biggest & Fastest Wealth Creators in GCC (2012-2021) Surprisingly it is not a static list[:]]]></Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]Investor’s motive to invest in any asset or company is to increase their wealth. Likewise, companies also aim to increase their operating performance, expand their assets, and add value to their shareholders. In GCC markets, top 25 wealth creating companies have added USD 330billion wealth to their shareholders over the last 10-year period (2012-21). The pace of wealth creation of these companies is also robust with a CAGR of 36% compared to S&P GCC Composite Index with a CAGR of 10%. 

Out of the top 25 wealth-creating companies, in terms of number of companies listed in each countries, majority of them were listed in Abu Dhabi & Saudi Arabia. Companies listed in Dubai and Kuwait followed this. Seven among twenty-five wealth creators are from the financial sector accounting for 30% of wealth generated followed by consumer staples (4) with a contribution of 24% of wealth creation and communication services (2) with a contribution of 18%.

<strong>Top five Biggest Wealth Creators (FY 2012-21)</strong>

The biggest wealth creator in terms of market capitalization during the last decade International Holding Company listed in Abu Dhabi Stock Exchange. The company created $75 billion of wealth since its listing in 2005, followed by Emirates Telecommunication Group Company ($56 billion). The first four of the top five wealth creators are Abu Dhabi-based whereas the fifth one is based out of Saudi Arabia.

<strong>Top five Fastest Wealth Creators (FY 2012-21)</strong>

<span style="color: #696969; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;">Source: Refinitiv; Marmore Research</span></p>

The fastest wealth creator in terms of annual growth rate of total return is also Abu Dhabi listed International Holding Company with CAGR of 101% which is more than 10x higher compared to the S&P GCC Composite Index with a CAGR of 10%. The International Holding Company created wealth at a slow pace for the first five years 2012-16 and then it added its wealth enormously with a CAGR of 210% in the last five years 2017-21. The shares have been increasing from 2019, when it was trading at ~AED 1 (its current share price is ~AED 190). The various acquisitions made since the start of 2019 seem to have contributed to the surge in share prices.
   
If the period is further broken into two five-year periods (2012-16 & 2017-22), major changes are observed in wealth-creating companies and sector performances. The wealth creators of 2012-16 are entirely swapped with a new set of companies in 2017-21. The wealth created in 2017-21 by these companies exceeded three times the wealth created in 2012-16. The number of companies in the top 25 wealth creators increased for Abu Dhabi (4 to 6) and Kuwait (1 to 6), remained the same for Saudi Arabia (10), Qatar (1), and Bahrain (1), and decreased for Dubai (8 to 1) in 2017-21 compared to 2012-16. There has been a shift in wealth creation among sectors from real estate to Materials and Industrial sectors between the period 2012-16 and 2017-21.

National Bank of Kuwait and Kuwait Finance House have reported annual increase in net profit for Q1 2022 at 38% and 39% respectively.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">IMF expects Kuwait’s real GDP to grow by 8.2% in 2022, the highest among GCC countries. World Bank has estimated Kuwait’s economy to grow by 5.7% in 2022 on the back of higher oil output and stronger domestic demand. Credit at Kuwait’s banks grew by 7.87% y/y in February 2022, with consumer loans increasing by 14.0% y/y.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Regionally, S&P GCC composite index rose by 2.8% for the month. GCC markets were positive for the month, except for Bahrain and Oman.

U.S. Treasury yields were up for the month, with the benchmark 10-year note surging from 2.32% (March end) to 2.88% on the back of sustained rise in inflation and U.S Fed Chair’s indication of a possible steeper rate hike in May. U.S. Fed Chair has indicated that an interest rate increase of 50 bps could be considered in the next meeting.

Oil prices were up by 1.3% for April 2022 supported by concerns of tighter supply. However, release of strategic reserves by countries and COVID-19 lockdown in China capped gains. Germany has extended support for European Union’s oil embargo on Russia, increasing the likelihood of an overall EU ban on Russian oil. OPEC has stated that it would not be possible to replace Russia’s supply of oil and other liquid exports, amounting to 7 million bpd, in the event of sanctions. IEA’s member nations plan to release 60 million barrels over the next six months. U.S would be matching that amount as part of its 180 million barrels release that it had announced in March.</p>

		<Title><![CDATA[[:en]GCC Logistics Sector: 2022 Outlook & Opportunities[:]]]></Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">Industrials and logistics have been identified as two core pillars to diversification agendas and key drivers of Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) into GCC economies. The GCC has become a central node in the worldwide circulation of commodities. The reasons for the growth of the Gulf’s logistics infrastructure relate to its strategic geographic location along the Asia–Europe trade route, which has resulted in large levels of expenditure on mega transport infrastructure in various GCC states, including ports, airports, trains and roads.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">More than 60% of the total expenditure on ports in the Middle East is in the GCC. Both new mega port construction and expansion of existing ports are taking place, with new, highly automated ports designed to accommodate the largest container ships in the world. These port projects are also integrally linked to the development of wider logistics networks, including passenger and freight railway schemes, airports, special economic zones and so-called logistics cities. In addition to being central to commodity circulation from Asia to Europe, GCC maritime ports are also positioned as crucial feeder ports to smaller East African ports.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In Saudi Arabia, the National Industrial Development and Logistics Program (NIDLP) was established with plans to transform the Kingdom into a leading industrial powerhouse and a global logistics hub by focusing on four key sectors; industry, mining, energy and logistics. USD 93billion King Abdullah Economic City (KAEC) includes the largest port in the Red Sea region and a logistics and industrial area.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Kuwait’s new Mubarak Port is designed to enhance its position into a regional trade hub. Bahrain’s Vision 2030 projects Bahrain as a regional manufacturing and logistics hub. Qatar’s National Vision 2030 has the construction of ‘world-class infrastructure’ as a principal element of its future development. The Omani state aims to leverage the position of ports outside the Strait of Hormuz to establish itself as a regional logistics hub. As with Jebel Ali, both Oman and Qatar seek to build an integrated logistics space that connects maritime ports, airports, rail and road. Linking ports with free zones that can assemble, label and repackage commodities due for re-export. This hard infrastructure is augmented by a soft infrastructure that seeks to incentivize international firms to relocate their activities to the new logistics spaces.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Key drivers of the sector growth are increasing contribution of the non-oil sector to GDP, infrastructure development, growth of free trade zones and industrial parks, and greater regional trade cooperation. One of the key challenges is that the sector is fragmented by many small and medium service providers with inefficient processes, weak supply chain management practices, and legacy IT infrastructure and systems. Unlike most other industries, the decline in economic activity during the pandemic has not affected global logistics too negatively. The sector offers opportunities for growth through acquisitions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To know more about the sector read our latest report on <a href="https://www.marmoremena.com/reports/gcc-logistics-sector/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>GCC Logistics Sector</u></strong></a>.</p>[:]]]></Content>

		<Title>[:en]NFTs: Beyond the Metaverse[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">We are at the brink of another internet evolution, where currency is decentralized via cryptocurrency and borders are porous in metaverse, technology is perpetually advancing, and the early adopters of new technology are more often than not rewarded for taking-on the risk of transition.
<img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NFTs-web.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="762" />
<span style="color: #696969; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;">Source: Goldman Sachs</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Among several approaches to bridge this gap, one that has caught a lot of attention recently is the Metaverse. Metaverse can be thought of as virtual-reality space, which allows users to interact with each other in a computer-generated environment. While the building blocks of this computer-generated environment are being set-up, the digital assets within these virtual spaces are driving a lot of attention. Among the digital assets attracting a great deal attention and capital, are Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A Non-Fungible Token (NFT) is essentially a digital asset that is verifiable on blockchain technology. An item is considered fungible when it is equivalent to something and thus can be exchanged for the same, for instance – a currency bill or even a bitcoin. As opposed to that a non-fungible item is characterized by its uniqueness.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">NFTs have been around for more than 5 years but have gained a lot of traction in the last two years, increasing from $24 million in volume traded in 2019 to $17.7 billion in 2021. Because of its non-fungible nature, every NFT is one of a kind, making them sought after collectible items. But because of its unique authentication feature, NFTs are going well beyond a collectible’s item and is paving its way in real life use-cases. From a utilitarian perspective, NFTs are being implemented for digital identity, access and authentication, ticketing, security, tokenization of physical assets, supply chain management and health records among others.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Closer to home in GCC, last few years of the global pandemic have underscored the need of diversifying from the oil-economy and to embrace the new digital economy. The road towards digitalizing the economy for the GCC countries that requires building an entire ecosystem and infrastructure, crosses path with the development of DeFi (decentralized finance) which is an emerging financial technology based on the blockchain. The interest for digital assets originated from both retail as well as institutional investors. Some of the key trends in the region include-</p>

<ul class="rdetails_list" style="text-align: left;">
 	<li>UAE SmartChain is capitalizing on the blockchain for vaccine medical records with the launch of “get pass” application.</li>
 	<li>The UAE Ministry of Economy announced that they would be testing tokenization of government owned energy infrastructure projects.</li>
 	<li>In Egypt, the Egyptian Customs Authority has implemented the Advance Cargo Information System that utilizes blockchain documentation proposes of cargos.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">Digital transformation coupled with energy efficiency is promising for the MENA region, that aims to cut-down its carbon emissions. On the regulation end of the spectrum, the UAE announced in March of 2022, establishment of the Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) under the Dubai World Trade Center Authority with the mandate of overseeing the regulation, licensing, and governance of virtual assets, NFTs, and cryptocurrencies. The regulation is picking-up pace with the technological innovation in the region, which is set to boost the investor confidence.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A new asset creates new opportunities but comes with its own set of new risks as legal frameworks lag innovation. Following an introduction of a new product, a legal framework, and a reliable marketplace for the same is developed. But, in the transitionary face, players going for a first-mover advantage also bear the first-mover disadvantages. Uncertain legal and regulatory framework becomes a key risk in this regard.</p>

		<Title>[:en]GCC Markets turn Bearish after a Two-Year uptrend - stung by Global Economy and Inflation[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">Kuwait’s All Share Index fell by 6.4% in the month of May as negativity in global markets caught up to the GCC region. The risk off sentiment among investors due to global economic growth concerns amid inflation and monetary policy tightening impacted Kuwait equities. Oil prices were up by 12.3% for the month in anticipation of a tight market with the peak oil-demand season in the U.S. approaching. Among sectors, Boursa Kuwait’s Telecom and Consumer Staples declined the most for the month at 8.4% and 8.2% respectively. Almost all the sectors ended negative this month except for Basic Materials sector, which remained positive with an increase of 4.0%. Among Premier Market stocks, National Investment Company and Alimtiaz Investment Group fell most for the month, declining 15.1% and 14.8% respectively. Agility's net profit in Q1 2022 increased slightly by 1% to KD 12.8 million from KD 12.6 million in Q1 2021.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Central Bank of Kuwait increased its discount rate by 25 basis points during the month to 2% to curb soaring inflation. The move came on the back of U.S Fed’s 50 bps rate increase - its steepest hike in 22 years. Kuwait's Consumers Price Index (CPI) climbed by 4.36% y/y in March, with food and beverage prices rising the most at the rate of 7.18% y/y. Rating agency Moody’s has affirmed Kuwait’s credit rating at A1 with a stable outlook, opining that the country’s balance sheet and fiscal buffers would remain strong in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Regionally, S&amp;P GCC composite index fell by 7.0% for the month. All GCC markets ended negative for the month. Dubai and Kuwait equity indices declined the most among GCC markets, falling 10.0% and 6.4% respectively over the month. Saudi Arabia declined by 5.9%. Among GCC sectors, while non-cyclical stocks gained the most for the month at 12.8%, telecom lost the most at 11.0%. Banking sector was down by 7.5% in May. Among GCC blue chip companies, the best performer was International Holding Company, which gained 28.3% during the month and 84.2% for the year due to strong earnings momentum and the company’s decision to invest USD 2 billion in three Adani Group companies from India in return for preferential shares in the companies.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The central banks of the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Qatar increased their benchmark interest rates by 50 bps following the U.S. Federal Reserve's move to raise its Fed Funds rate by the same amount. Saudi Arabia's real GDP increased 9.6% y/y in Q1 2022, fueled by oil activities, which grew by 20.4% in Q1 2022. Saudi’s non-oil exports grew nearly 29% y/y in the first quarter of 2022, reaching about USD 21 billion. Abu Dhabi-based petrochemicals company Borouge had set its IPO price at AED 2.45 (USD 0.67) per share, implying an equity value of USD 20 bn and would offer 10% of its shares through the IPO. Saudi Aramco reported an 82% y/y increase in its net profit for Q1 2022, marking the company’s highest quarterly earnings since it went public in 2019. Aramco’s shares gained 2.7% in May while most GCC blue chip have corrected sharply during the same period. The stock is up 28.7% for the year. During the month, Aramco had overtaken Apple Inc. to become the world’s most valuable company by market capitalization.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Developed markets’ performance was mixed during the month with MSCI World losing 0.2% and S&amp;P 500 remaining flat. While the markets trended negative for most of the month on concerns of economic growth amid inflation and quantitative tightening, they recovered lost ground towards the month end on signs that inflation could be peaking. Japan’s TOPIX was up 0.7% while UK’s FTSE gained 0.8%. Major global markets remained cautious of the impact of rising interest rates, China's lockdown, persisting geopolitical tensions, and their impact on broader economic growth. U.S’ headline CPI increased by 8.3% y/y April 2022. Inflation in the United Kingdom surged by 9% y/y, the highest rate in four decades, due to rising food and energy prices. U.K. GDP fell 0.1% in March and economists expect further contractions in the coming months. China’s equity market was positive for the month supported by the central bank’s move to lower five-year loan prime rate (LPR) by 15 bps to 4.45%, the biggest reduction since China revamped the interest rate mechanism in 2019.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Oil prices were up by 12.3% for May 2022, clocking a year-to-date increase of 57.9%, supported by concerns over tightening of supply, outweighing investor concerns about a global economic slowdown or even recession. OPEC+ would reportedly increase supply by 432,000 barrels per day in June, in keeping with the existing plan to unravel restraints. Hungary continues to be a barrier for the EU's oil embargo against Russia, as EU sanctions require unanimous approval of all EU members. Hungary is requesting approximately 750 million euros (USD 800 million) in order to improve its refineries and build a pipeline from Croatia. Bank of America has commented that oil prices could push past USD 150 per barrel in case of sharp contraction in Russian oil exports.</p>

		<Title>[:en]Emergence of Cloud Kitchens in the UAE[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">A cloud kitchen is a restaurant kitchen that solely accepts delivery orders and does not have a dining area. Many restaurants have adopted this new business model known as "cloud kitchens," sometimes known as "dark kitchens" or "ghost kitchens." It has several advantages over traditional restaurants. Cloud kitchens are more concerned with deliveries and meal quality than with creating a pleasant atmosphere like traditional restaurants. These restaurants do not have a real dining facility instead; orders are placed online through applications or websites.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Comparing the key differences between a traditional restaurant and a cloud kitchen</strong>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Emergence-of-Cloud-Kitchens-in-the-UAE_Fig1.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="762" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The number of Emirati food companies that have chosen to join the Dark Kitchen ecosystem has kept increasing, particularly in the year 2020 when the COVID pandemic started. Virtual kitchens, ghost kitchens, cloud kitchens, and delivery-only kitchens all function on the same principle, but with different business models, selling meals solely through delivery systems. Several globally recognised F&B brands have opened dark kitchens in the UAE in the last year. For example, Kitopi helped renowned American brands Nathan's Famous and Bondi Sushi get into the market. With the increased penetration of dark kitchens following the COVID pandemic, the UAE online food delivery market is predicted to develop at a CAGR of 23%, based on the research from business consulting company RedSeer, with over 400 brands and more than 80 locations in the UAE, the number of dark kitchen brands and outlets has expanded as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the UAE, the number of Cloud kitchens is increasing with notable brands like Kitopi, Kitch, Kitchen Nation, Kitchen Park etc., Kitopi is one of the most popular cloud kitchen platforms in the UAE. It was launched in Dubai in January 2018 and has since expanded to Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia. Kitopi manages the whole food manufacturing and delivery process, including sourcing materials, cooking, packaging, and even delivery. Kitopi makes use of cutting-edge technology to ensure that the meal preparation and delivery procedures are as smooth as possible. It expanded its products to include subscription-based meal plans as well as grocery delivery by leveraging its supply chain. The unique Smart Kitchen Operating System accounts for a significant portion of their competitive edge. SKOS is a set of real-time applications that optimise the performance of cloud kitchen operations. By increasing operational efficiency, the solution focuses on providing a great customer experience among numerous brands in a single kitchen. In only three years since its start, SKOS has helped Kitopi grow to 200+ businesses in 60+ locations. Kitopi kitchens were able to double the order volume by minimizing kitchen preparation time by 40% throughout this time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Kitch is a hybrid cloud kitchen and storefront operator founded in Dubai. It consists of completely optimised and contemporary commercial kitchens, where orders are processed online and presented in each restaurant's station, where the staff prepares and packages the food, and Kitch provides dispatching services.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Running a cloud kitchen is less expensive than running a full-service restaurant, where infrastructure and operational costs are high compared to a full-service restaurant. This enables cloud kitchens in the UAE to increase their profit margins and offer nominally attractive rates, attracting more customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Cloud kitchen is a low-risk and high-reward venture. When compared to a brick-and-mortar restaurant, the initial investment necessary to start a cloud kitchen is far lower. As a result, starting a cloud kitchen is a low-risk venture. It allows restaurant owners to experiment while lowering overhead costs, making it a profitable endeavour. In Dubai, cloud kitchens are quickly grabbing the Food and Beverage industry, and the food delivery business is expected to grow in the upcoming years. The growth of cloud kitchen and food delivery platforms is high after the introduction of value-added tax (VAT) in the UAE in January 2018.</p>

		<Title>[:en]GCC Population Will Be Lesser and Older by the End of this Century[:]</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[[:en]<p style="text-align: left;">GCC Countries’ population is expected to reach its peak of 68 million in 2048 and decline thereafter, according to the UN World population prospects (low variant - In the low variant, total fertility is projected to remain at 0.5 births.) forecast. GCC population is expected to shrink by 12.6% to 52.5 million by the end of this century. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates will have the largest population contraction among the GCC countries, with declines of 19.2 % and 9%, respectively by 2100. Bahrain and Oman will also see a downtrend in the population of 7.7% and 0.3% respectively by this century. While Qatar and Kuwait will have an increase in population by 9.6% and 1% respectively.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Country wise Population Projections</strong>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GCC-Demographics-Fig-2.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="762" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The major reason for a possible population contraction is the declining fertility rate and the decline in the expatriate population. The total fertility rate (TFR) of a population is the average number of children born to a woman over her lifetime. The total fertility rate for the GCC region is 1.8 in 2022 which is less than 2, the replacement level rate that is needed to hold the population constant. TFR is expected to decline further to 1.15 by 2060 which will significantly reduce the population.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>GCC Fertility Rate</strong>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GCC-Demographics-Fig-3.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="762" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>GCC Life Expectancy</strong>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GCC-Demographics-Fig-4.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="762" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Population profile of GCC countries’ is unique compared to other countries, as expatriates account for a substantial proportion of the GCC population in varying degrees in different GCC countries. With the diminishing world population expected in the coming years, the expatriates migrating to GCC countries could also significantly reduce, consequently leading to a decline in the GCC population.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">GCC population is expected to become significantly lesser and older by the end of this century. The median age of the GCC population will rise to 51 in 2100 from 32 in 2022. The old-age dependency is ratio of the population ages 65-plus supported by the population ages 16-64. The old-age dependency of GCC will increase over time and reach 60.2 in 2100. This indicates that every 100 working people should support 60 old age people in GCC by 2100.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>GCC Population Pyramid</strong>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GCC-Demographics-Fig-5.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="762" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GCC-Demographics-Fig-6.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="762" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Dependency Ratio in GCC</strong>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="https://www.marmoremena.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GCC-Demographics-Fig-7.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="762" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Impact of declining population on various asset classes:</strong>
<strong>Equity:</strong> The impact of this population contraction on the economy can be huge as the overall demand and supply in both domestic and global markets will fall substantially. There are two possible course for equity market. Due to a fall in demand, companies must reduce their supply, which consequently would downgrade their revenue and profits. The equity market will become unattractive to investors till the population cycle reaches the early expansion stage. However, there will be greater financial inclusion, and many more individuals will have investing knowledge and be comfortable with technology, which will lead to an increase in active trading accounts, which would help sustain the equities market. As the global population would be aging, cash and carry equities, mutual funds, exchange traded funds (ETFs), which are less risky compared to options and futures trading would become preferred among the equities asset class.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Fixed Income:</strong> Retirement funds have a significant proportion of fixed income securities in their portfolio. Hence, the fixed income market will perform well and would be attractive due to the growing aging population that will become risk averse.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Commodities:</strong> Demand for major commodities could witness a downtrend due to reducing demand. On the other side, the supply costs for commodities would increase owing to labor shortages. Oil demand would reduce due lower energy requirement as the mobility and transportation requirements of the aging population would remain lesser.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Real Estate:</strong> High dependency ratio and lesser younger population would imply that community living, living with medical care would become the preferred choices for older people. Demand for individual villas, apartments could witness a substantial decline as demand from working age group might decline.</p>[:]]]></Content>
