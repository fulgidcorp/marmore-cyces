152,"Value Traded (In USD Mn)","A 5-year overview of the GCC stock markets’ liquidity (traded value) reveals a falling trend. Saudi Arabia value traded almost halved from over $529 billion in 2014 to a little over $235 billion in 2018, While UAE shed more than 80% of its value from its peak in 2014.","GCC Region"
190,"Real GDP Growth Rate (in %)","The inflation-adjusted GDP growth in all economies of the Arabian Gulf region is poised to gather momentum from this year through 2021. As the infographics shows, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Kuwait are forecast to see a great leap from negative GDP growth in 2017 to a positive one from this year. Oil price stabilization is expected to ease fiscal pressure and enable governments to adopt expansionary fiscal stance that should, in turn, boost GDP growth.","GCC Region"
192,"THINK TANKS IN GCC","These are interesting times in the Gulf as the region is undergoing seismic socio-economic transformation. As the oil-based economies move towards a post-oil future, the role of think tanks to provide the crucial research support as well as the assessment of the effectiveness of these efforts assumes significance. As shown in the chart below, the region is home to some of the leading think tanks which have been making strides in recent years and assisting decision-making. The question now is: What’s the next step in their evolution?","GCC Region"

757,"Annual pretax income threshold to be in the top 1% of earners","The income of top 1% of earners in a country is often used as a metric to judge its income standards. However, the quantum of income required to be a part of that elite group varies widely between countries. For instance, one needs to earn nearly twice as much in the GCC (on an average) than in the U.S. to make it to the top 1% earners.",Global
759,"Timeline of Saudi Arabia's inclusion In Emerging Market Indices","Global index providers MSCI and FTSE Russell have upgraded Saudi Arabia to Emerging Market status. FTSE Russell will be implementing a five phase transition process with the 5th phase to be completed in March of 2020. MSCI is following a two phase implementation process with the second phase to be completed in August of 2019. How much capital inflow can we expect into Saudi Arabia from the index inclusion?","Saudi Arabia"
761,"Distribution of Expatriate Workforce In Kuwait","The profession wise distribution of Kuwait’s expatriate workforce reveals interesting dynamics. Non-domestic blue collar work comprising labor in mining, construction, manufacturing and transport engages the maximum number of expats at 32%, followed by human and domestic services that employ the unskilled expat population. In what can be viewed as a clear response to Kuwaitization policy, the number of expatriates working in the public sector is the lowest at 0.03 percent.",Kuwait
763,"Expectation of low oil price pose challenge to budgetary Finance For Most GCC States","Low oil price in 2019 could hamper the spending plans of GCC governments.
Fiscal break even oil price for most GCC states is much higher than expectations.","GCC Region"
765,"GCC Stock Market Liquidity","Liquidity has been one of the key issues grappling the GCC stock markets in recent years. In spite of the reforms initiated by Capital Market authorities in the GCC, the turnover ratio has fallen steeply in 2018 for all GCC countries except Bahrain when compared to 2014.","GCC Region"

771,"Inclusion of GCC Countries to the JPM EMBI will lower the overall risk of the Index","The inclusion of #GCC Fixed Income is a landmark moment and could signal the opening of a new chapter in the regional capital markets. The GCC region with its high reserve levels, investment grade ratings and low volatility offer significant opportunities to reduce risk. Inclusion in the benchmark J.P Morgan Emerging Market Index (JPM EMBI) could lower the overall risk of the index.","GCC Region|Global"
773,"How Competitive are GCC Economies? Doing Business Ranking","At the global rank of 11, the UAE has the most improved score in Ease of Doing Business ranking in the GCC in 2018. The distant second spot is occupied by Bahrain with the global rank of 62. Barring the UAE, all other GCC countries require to significantly adopt large-scale reforms and improve business conditions.","GCC Region"
775,"Kuwait's non-hydrocarbon sector remains resilient as economic growth is on the rise","Kuwait’s economy has been under pressure ever since oil prices fell in 2014, as the slowdown in economic activity took its toll on the non-hydrocarbon sector as well. Supportive fiscal policy in the past few years has seen capital expenditure grow, which has, in turn, helped Kuwait’s non-oil economy to rebound. Continued capital expenditure and structural reforms are expected to provide further impetus to the non-oil sector and supplement its steady growth in the coming years.",Kuwait
777,"GCC Sovereign Bond Yields (10 Yrs)","GCC’s government debt capital market has grown significantly in the last few years. The GCC governments have been among the biggest debt issuers globally, and investors have poured in billions of dollars in regional sovereign bonds. The chart shows comparative yields on 10-year GCC government bonds, with yields on Oman being the highest while Kuwait being the lowest. The bottomline is: With lower volatility and attractive yields, GCC sovereign bonds have emerged as more attractive asset class.","GCC Region"
783,"World's Largest Cities: How the pecking order is changing","The world’s urban population has grown rapidly in the last few decades. What’s more interesting is that future increases in the size of the world’s population are expected to be highly concentrated in just a handful of the world’s largest cities. As the diagram below shows, Asia’s largest cities together will account for around two-third of the overall projected population of world’s 10 largest cities in 2035.",Global
786,"GCC Fiscal Balance ( as a % of GDP)","Stronger oil revenues, pick-up in the non-oil sector growth, and fiscal and structural reforms will help GCC economies to strike a right balance between revenues and expenditure in the near term. As the infographics below shows, most GCC countries are expected to see tangible improvements in their fiscal positions, although they are forecast to remain in negative territory in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain despite the improvement.","GCC Region"
788,"GCC Current Account Balance ( as a % of GDP)","The recent recovery in oil prices and the easing of fiscal consolidation are boosting near-term growth prospects of the GCC economies. Look at the infographics below that explains how their current account balance, as a percentage of GDP, is projected to recover in 2018 and 2019. However, the hard truth is: much of this positive outlook remains subject to volatility in the future course of oil prices.","GCC Region"
791,"GCC Inflation Rate (in %)","GCC countries are projected to see the inflation level hardening in 2018 through 2021 from 2017 level. The recovery in oil prices is encouraging more pro-growth fiscal policies in the GCC, prompting governments to push fiscal spending and expansionary budgeting course. However, this fiscal push coupled with the effects of the VAT and rising fuel prices, runs the risk of fueling inflationary trends. Will rising inflation hurt the regions’ growth prospects?","GCC Region"
794,"Power of Passport - GCC Comparison","Not all passports are the same when it comes to having cross-border access around the globe. The citizens of the #GCC countries are slowly, but surely, becoming more global and more powerful, if their passports are any indication. Take for instance, the holders of the UAE passport who can now travel to 167 countries (the most by any passport holder) without the need for pre-visa requirements. As the diagram below shows, rest of the GCC countries also rank within top 55 passports globally in terms of enjoying visa-free travel.","GCC Region"
796,"GCC's Top Islamic Banks by Assets","The Islamic banking sector continues to grow in size and dominance in the GCC region. Our infographic below takes a peek at the largest Islamic banks in the region based on their assets. Top five banks capture 60% assets share.

Five of the 19 biggest banks are based in Kuwait, 4 each in the UAE and Bahrain, and 3 each in Saudi Arabia and Qatar.","GCC Region"
802,"YTD 2018 Returns of GCC Equity Indices","In many ways the story of the GCC equity markets in 2018 has been the one of two extremes. On one end of the spectrum is Dubai benchmark that remains the biggest drag, on the other end is Qatar that blazed the trail. But then 2 key questions arise: One, have the recent sell-offs made valuations attractive in Dubai and Oman? Two, are some stock market highs in the GCC justified?","GCC Region"
804,"Private Sector Credit Growth (in %)","Subdued oil prices, over the last few years, have impacted private sector credit growth in the GCC region owing to a weak macroeconomic backdrop and muted non-oil economic growth. As the diagram below shows, as oil prices have been rebounding, albeit slowly, this is expected to propel private sector credit growth in 2018 in most of the Arabian Gulf countries except in Qatar. The key question is: Will the stagnant private sector lending weigh on GCC banks and impact their margins?","GCC Region"
808,"3 month Deposit rate in the GCC","The cooling eurozone economy and its easy monetary policy are reflected in the deposit rate (the rate at which banks park funds at the central bank) which is in negative territory. By contrast, higher deposit rates in the US reflect recovery of the American economy. Same is the case in the GCC region which, due to their currencies’ peg to the dollar, follow the US monetary policy. The question is: Will this global monetary policy divergence lead to global imbalances?","GCC Region"
811,"Global Financial Centre Index (GFCI) Rankings","Cities around the world, as well as across the MiddleEast, are encouraging innovation and putting in place best practices in order to differentiate themselves as competition between financial centres intensifies. As shown in the diagram below, New York saw its ranking improve on the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI) from being second in 2017 to claim the top position this year. Likewise, in the Middle East, Dubai climbed to 15th rank in 2018 on the GFCI, from 19th position in 2017.","GCC Region|Global"
814,"Ease of Doing Business Parameters - Kuwait 2017 - 2019","A comparison of World Bank’s ‘Doing Business’ reports of last three years – 2017, 2018, 2019 -- shows Kuwait has improved, though marginally, on the overall ease of doing business parameter. Performance across sub parameters varies though.",Kuwait
817,"GCC Capital Flows (in USD Bn)","During 2003-2007, the GCC region enjoyed positive capital flows buoyed by high growth and rising oil prices. However, the global financial-crisis in 2009 severely impacted the capital flows as foreign investors withdrew their positions. Consequently, as the chart below shows, since 2013 the region has been seeing the loss of capital. The net capital flows are expected to be negative until 2020, though the gap between resident and non-resident capital flows has been reducing. The question is: Is it capital flight or normal flows?","GCC Region"
819,"Fiscal Breakeven Oil Price","The year-on-year fall in the fiscal breakeven oil price of the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Oman in 2018 are expected to bring relief to them. In contrast, as the diagram shows, the economies of Kuwait and Qatar are likely to continue feeling the pain, as the rise in their fiscal breakeven oil price this year, compared to 2017, is likely to keep their balance sheets under pressure.","GCC Region"
823,"Banking Sector - Risk Return Metrics","Generally speaking, investing in any #asset involves the risk-return tradeoff. This means the higher the risk, the higher the potential return. As shown in the chart below, the 5-year return of different banking stock indices across the GCC has been moving in tandem with the level of risks associated. For instance, Dubai’s banking index offers the highest return, but it also carries the highest risk. Likewise, Kuwait’s banking stocks are least risky but they offer the lowest returns. The bottomline: No pain, no gain.","GCC Region"
825,"Foreign Direct Investment","The softening of #crude oil prices over the last few years has taken a toll on the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows in the GCC region. This year, however, FDI inflows have so far held up relatively well and are expected to be higher than in 2017. Last year saw FDI in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait take a sharp dip compared to 2016. Overall, the UAE continues to lead the pack in the region in terms of attracting highest FDI inflows for the last 3 years, consecutively.","GCC Region"
827,"Saudi 5yr bond yield spread widens against similar rated countries","Going by the conventional metrics used by economists, rising sovereign bond yields flash warning signs for a country’s economic trajectory. Currently, the widening spread between Saudi Arabia’s 5-year bond yields and those of similar rated countries imply higher risk perception among investors about the Kingdom’s economy. The key question: is the widening yield temporary or something that is here to stay?","Global|Saudi Arabia"
829,"Spread Between Saudi Index And MSCI EM P/E TTM","In June 2018, the #Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul) had won MSCI Emerging Market (EM) status, after Tadawul fulfilled MSCI’s requirements to join EM index. However, the valuation gap between stocks in Saudi Arabia and EM has been expanding for around a year, and currently, Saudi Arabian stocks are trading at a premium compared to the MSCI EM Index.
